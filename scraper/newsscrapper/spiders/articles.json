      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Courts decide vexing legal matters and interpret opaque constitutional language all the time, from defining pornography and judging whether a search or seizure is unreasonable to determining how speedy a speedy trial must be.",
      "And then there is the issue that some judges increasingly say is beyond their abilities to adjudicate. It was on display again last week, in North Carolina.",
      "The North Carolina Supreme Court said that ",
      " to determine when even egregious gerrymanders \u2014 in this case, lopsided partisan maps of the state\u2019s General Assembly and its 14 congressional districts \u2014 cross the line between skewed but legal and unconstitutionally rigged. In addition, the justices said, any court-ordered standard \u201cwould embroil the judiciary in every local election in every county, city and district across the state.\u201d",
      "The effect was to give the Republican-led legislature carte blanche to draw new maps for 2024 elections that lock in G.O.P. political dominance, even though the state\u2019s electorate is split almost evenly between the two major parties.",
      "Under its current court-ordered map, North Carolina now elects seven Democrats and seven Republicans to the U.S. House. Maps drawn by the Republican legislature could mean 10 Republicans to four Democrats, or possibly 11 to three. Without judicial review, the only remedy is to vote the dominant party out using maps drawn to keep them in power.",
      "The 5-to-2 decision, which fell along party lines in a court led by Republicans, pointedly threw out a ruling by a Democrat-led court only a few months earlier that said such lines could \u2014 and should \u2014 be drawn. In that respect, the North Carolina ruling reinforced what seems to be a hardening partisan divide between jurists who believe unfair political maps should be policed and ones who do not.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court also split along partisan lines in 2019 when it ruled 5 to 4, after decades of dithering, that it could not devise a legal standard to regulate partisan gerrymandering, though it suggested that state courts could.",
      "It is hard to separate party allegiance from jurists\u2019 positions, said Paul M. Smith, the senior vice president of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan advocacy group that litigates voting rights issues.",
      "\u201cOne explanation would be that the courts decide cases about elections based on who will be helped,\u201d he said. \u201cOn some days, I\u2019m cynical enough to believe that.\u201d Whether that consciously figures in court decisions, though, is less easy to say, he added.",
      "Nate Persily, a Stanford Law School professor and expert on election law and democracy, said that any standard for judging partisan gerrymanders has to be above reproach.",
      "\u201cThe response is always going to be that you\u2019re picking winners and losers,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless we come up with some sort of clear mathematical test, I respect the argument that judges\u2019 political preferences might creep into the process.\u201d",
      " Passing judgment on a legislature\u2019s constitutional authority to set political boundaries can be a fraught exercise. In 1962, one U.S. Supreme Court justice, Charles Evans Whittaker, who had heard the historic redistricting case Baker v. Carr, ",
      " during the court\u2019s deliberations and skipped the final vote.",
      "But some say that just because it is hard to create fair district lines does not mean it cannot be done.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s intellectually dishonest and intellectually lazy,\u201d ",
      ", a political independent and a member of the ",
      ", said in an interview. \u201cWe had a commission made up of 13 randomly selected voters of varying educational backgrounds, and somehow we were able to come up with fair standards.\u201d",
      "The Michigan commissioners drew their first set of maps after the 2020 election, following orders not to give any party a \u201cdisproportionate advantage.\u201d They relied on several statistical metrics to meet that standard. But overall, they decided that an acceptable range for the statewide ratio of votes to seats won would fall within five percentage points of their calculation of the state\u2019s political preferences: 52 percent Democratic, 48 percent Republican.",
      "In practice, Ms Szetela said, the maps hewed closely to the calculated partisan divide. ",
      "Still, some experts say that it is impossible to construct a standard that will be reliably fair. ",
      ", an election-law expert at UCLA School of Law, said that would-be regulators of partisan gerrymanders by and large know little of how politics really works. He said that he picked up such an education during the 1970s while working in the California Secretary of State office, and later while running the state\u2019s ",
      ".",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says elections have to be fair,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s a good thing, because different people all have different concepts of what it means to be fair.\u201d",
      ", professor emeritus of law at Yale wrote a detailed analysis on the topic, \u201c",
      "\u201d in 1987. \u201cI just don\u2019t see any objective criteria that would be authoritative in assessing whether a gerrymander ought to be upheld or not,\u201d he said. ",
      "A few other state courts have set standards for partisan gerrymandering and applied them. Pennsylvania was the first state to ",
      " in 2018, and the Alaska Supreme Court ",
      " last month stating that gerrymandered State Senate seats violated the State Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause.",
      "Many voting rights advocates say the same computer-driven advances that enable today\u2019s extreme gerrymanders also make it possible to easily spot them.",
      "In particular, software programs can now generate ",
      " of maps of hypothetical political districts, each with small variations in their borders. Using statistical measures, those maps can be compared to a map being contested to gauge their partisan slant.",
      "In actual court cases, the technique has shown that some gerrymandered maps produce more lopsided partisan outcomes than 99 percent and more of the hypothetical ones.",
      "M",
      ", as social scientists employed data analytics to tease out the partisan impact of map changes. One yardstick, called ",
      ", gauges how much the votes of one party are wasted when its voters are disproportionately packed into one district or carved up among several. Another, ",
      ", measures the effectiveness of a gerrymandered map by calculating how many seats the same map would give each party in a hypothetical election where voters were split 50-50. ",
      "There are many others, and each has its shortcomings. For example, voters sort themselves geographically, with a lopsided share of Democrats packed in cities and Republicans in rural areas, for reasons that have nothing to do with partisan skulduggery. And some metrics are useful only in particular situations, such as in states where party support is closely divided.",
      "In a 2017 hearing in a Wisconsin partisan gerrymander case, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. called such metrics \u201csociological gobbledygook.\u201d But if so, much of American jurisprudence carries the same label, said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a Harvard University law professor who has been a leading advocate of standards to judge partisan gerrymanders.",
      "\u201cIn any voting rights case, people have to calculate racial polarization, which is a far more complex calculation than the efficiency gap,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to calculate the compactness of districts. You have to estimate voting patterns for minority voters and white voters.\u201d",
      "\u201cTests involving some matter of degree are just ubiquitous in constitutional law,\u201d he added, and nothing makes a partisan gerrymander case any different.",
      "Mr. Stephanopoulos and others also say that drawing a line between permissible and illegal political maps is not all that difficult. Courts make similar judgments in lawsuits claiming racial bias in redistricting, he noted. After the one-person, one-vote ruling in 1964, judges quickly set a limit \u2014 10 percent \u2014 on how much political districts could deviate from the new requirement to have substantially equal populations.",
      "Some gerrymandering yardsticks have already been suggested. For example, a political map might be assumed constitutional unless measures of partisanship uniformly argued against it. At that point, the body that drew the map would have to demonstrate another compelling reason for the way boundaries were drawn.",
      "Critics like Professor Lowenstein argue that any dividing line between unfair and fair maps will have an unwanted consequence: Every subsequent map may be drawn to extract as much partisan gain as possible, yet fall just short of the legal standard for rejection.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate question,\u201d Professor Schuck said, \u201cis how crude a fit should a court be willing to accept?\u201d",
      "Then again, he pointed out, the U.S. Supreme Court and the North Carolina Supreme Court have answered that question: Future political maps, they have ruled, can be as crude as their makers want them to be.",
      "\u201cDeclining to apply a rule is still going to validate or invalidate what politicians have done,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no total innocence, no virginity, as it were.\u201d"

      "CHESTER, England \u2014 When Waheed Arian was 5, his father knelt by his side and handed him a big, colorful kite. That small moment, in Afghanistan, seared itself into the son\u2019s memory.",
      "\u201cI was a child born into war, \u201c said Dr. Arian, now 39 and a medical doctor. \u201cI had no idea what normality was like. And I only have a couple of happy memories like this from the first years of my life.\u201d",
      "Those years, in the late 1980s and 1990s, were spent in the chaos of war, with uncertainty swirling around him, first in his home city of Kabul; then in a refugee camp in Pakistan where he was displaced with his family; and then back to an Afghanistan engulfed in civil war.",
      "Decades later, driven by hopes of one day becoming a doctor, he established a new life in Britain, where he overcame post-traumatic stress disorder, learned English and studied medicine at Cambridge University, eventually becoming an emergency room doctor.",
      "\u201cI came in with no family support and hardly an education,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cBut I wanted to do something with my life and I was taking steps toward it, although it was a long shot.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, ",
      " from Kabul to Britain as an asylum seeker. His story, a personal tale of overcoming odds, illustrates how Britain\u2019s asylum system has long provided sanctuary and opportunity for countless people.",
      "But in recent years, successive Conservative governments have cracked down on the process, particularly with policies intended to deter asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel.",
      "This month, the government ",
      " crossing the Channel without hearing their asylum claims, a position that has been criticized by human rights groups. The British government says that many who arrive this way are economic migrants and that the policy will act as a deterrent. Government data, though, shows that a majority who reach shore are eventually granted asylum.",
      "Dr. Arian said his own journey showed \u201cwhat can be done when you allow people to realize their potential.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this case, you can see the future I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are so many other futures on the line.\u201d",
      "Speaking from his home in Chester in northwestern England, Dr. Arian, a father of two, recounted the arduous journey that led him out of Afghanistan.",
      "When his parents sent him to Britain in 1999, alone at 15, it was a tough decision for them, he said. But, he explained, \u201cI was at risk of being taken as a military soldier.\u201d He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a future. I wanted to become a doctor, not a killer.\u201d",
      "So his parents scraped together the money to pay a man to help him get to Britain to join a family friend.",
      "He boarded a plane from Islamabad, Pakistan, a false passport in hand, and claimed asylum when he arrived.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I landed in the U.K., I was handcuffed and I was put in a prison,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did come with that hope of safety, and the dream to become a doctor.\u201d",
      "That dream began in childhood when he was treated for tuberculosis contracted in the refugee camp in Pakistan. Despite a grim prognosis, a local doctor gave him excellent care \u2014 and a textbook and a stethoscope. He made a full recovery and he now knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, I saw so much suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on the other hand, there was this healer who could actually magically heal people.\u201d",
      "He eventually received refugee status in Britain. He worked three jobs and began studying for his college exams. He remembers other Afghan refugees telling him to become a driver or maybe a shopkeeper.",
      "Instead, he applied to Cambridge University. And against the odds, he got in, and then went on to medical school. He became a British citizen.",
      "A soft-spoken man who seems to put care and attention into every word, Dr. Arian spoke of the importance of giving back through humanitarian efforts.",
      "\u201cWe might think it\u2019s a small thing,\u201d he said, describing the many supporters who offered him a kind word, a job or other opportunities over the years. \u201cBut it\u2019s not for many refugees. Their futures rely on all these small parts, these bits of community service, that can then shape their future.\u201d",
      "In 2015, he founded, ",
      ", a nonprofit online platform\u00a0that connects British doctors with medics in Afghanistan through video links. The service was later extended to connect doctors in Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones, to professionals around the world. It ",
      "Dr. Arian is now building off that success with\u00a0",
      ", a platform meant to offer culturally sensitive mental health support, which he believes can be beneficial for refugees who have experienced trauma. It will be free for those who can\u2019t afford to pay.",
      "He hopes to roll out Arian Wellbeing in the coming months to provide aid for those newly arrived in Britain as part of a pilot with some local officials. Within five years, he hopes thousands of psychologists will offer their services on the platform, so that it can help when the next disaster, like the recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria, or the war in Ukraine, arrives.",
      "For years after reaching the safety of Britain, the ghosts of his past haunted him.",
      "\u201cI was working so hard, three jobs at first \u2014 cleaning, kitchen porter, as well as a salesman, and in the evening I was studying a bit of English as well,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cIt was at that time that my PTSD started showing.\u201d",
      "He found himself unable to relax, clenching his hands and having flashbacks. In the middle of the night, he would wake up with intense nightmares.",
      "Working with a psychologist has helped him address these problems, he said.",
      "He, his wife and their children live in a two-bedroom home with a big backyard. They have a Burmese cat and a small dog named Pushkin. The yard is scattered with children\u2019s toys, and the walls of the home are lined with family photos. Some siblings and his father are still in Afghanistan; his mother recently died there.",
      "Last month, Dr. Arian visited a local hotel where hundreds of recently arrived asylum seekers from Afghanistan were being housed after being displaced when the country was retaken by the Taliban in 2021.",
      "\u201cI see the same problems that I experienced in their eyes,\u201d he said, describing how the children\u2019s faces lit up when he spoke to them in their shared mother tongue.",
      "In this meeting, and in the others he has had with asylum seekers from across the world who arrive in Britain, he said he has seen just how detrimental the government\u2019s policies have been on their mental health.",
      "\u201cI can only imagine what at-risk refugees are going through in hotels,\u201d he said, where many are being housed as they await a decision on their future. \u201cWe have made friends with some of them, and they are being retraumatized to be going through all this.\u201d",
      "Most of all, he saw a reflection of his own story. He hopes he can be an example for those who struggle with the complexity of life in a new and unfamiliar place.",

      "SANTA MAR\u00cdA DE JES\u00daS, Guatemala \u2014 For her big underwater scene in \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever,\u201d the Guatemalan actress Mar\u00eda Mercedes Coroy had to hold her breath as her character, Princess Fen, gives birth in a hazy ocean world to a winged serpent son.",
      "She emerges from the watery depths as a rarity even in Marvel\u2019s fantastical universe: a female Maya superhero.",
      "The day after filming her final scene in Los Angeles, Ms. Coroy, rather than hanging out in Hollywood, headed home to Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, a Kaqchikel Maya town of about 22,000 at the base of a volcano in Guatemala. By nightfall, she was curled up in bed in her family\u2019s bright pink cinder block house with vegetables growing in the backyard.",
      "\u201cI felt like my bed was hugging me,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, 28, one of nine siblings in a family of farmers and vendors.",
      "The next morning she resumed her usual life. She and her mother put on their hand-woven huipiles, or blouses, and cortes, or skirts, to catch the 5:30 bus to the small city of Escuintla to sell produce in the bustling market, a job she started after fifth grade when she had to drop out of school to help her parents.",
      "Some days she walks two hours with a mule to the family farm to cultivate cabbage and pumpkins. In her spare time, she weaves colorful huipiles with motifs of birds and flowers on a backstrap loom.",
      "\u201cPeople ask me what I do after filming,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who is working on her third Guatemalan movie after appearing in two in the United States. \u201cI go back to normal.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy represents a new generation of Maya actors determined to hone their craft while holding onto their customs and helping expose a legacy of discrimination against Guatemala\u2019s Indigenous population.",
      "While she said she enjoys acting in the United States \u2014 and posing in a pink and blue huipil at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards \u2014 she is more interested in her own country\u2019s burgeoning film industry.",
      "But whether she\u2019s working in her homeland or Hollywood, acting can be draining, and she relies on Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas to recharge her.",
      "\u201cI love my life, but filming is physically demanding,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, relaxing on a bench in Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019s central park. \u201cThis is my community.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy\u2019s first role was the lead in a school play production of \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u201d",

He wanted to tell a story of Maya women that addressed issues like endemic poverty and inequities in education and health care, and he was determined to cast Maya actors speaking the Indigenous language of Kaqchikel.",
      "Mr. Bustamante initially put up a sign in the town\u2019s central park: Casting Here. No one showed up. A few days later he posted: Work Here. He was overwhelmed with prospective actors.",
      "Ms. Coroy missed the audition. But a friend put her in touch with the director the next day.",
      "\u201cHe told me I was the only person who looked him in the eye,\u201d she said. When he offered her the lead, she balked. \u201cI had no experience. I was afraid I would ruin the movie.\u201d",
      "But he convinced her to join the cast. For the next several months, they trained at the country\u2019s first film academy, founded by Mr. Bustamante.",
      "\u201cWhen we began filming, they were no longer amateur actors,\u201d Mr. Bustamante said.",

The daughter secretly gets involved with a young man, a drunk and a dreamer, who promises to take her with him to the United States. But he leaves without her and she finds herself pregnant while still engaged to the other man.",
      "After she gives birth in a hospital, a staff member tells her that her baby has died. When the young woman finds out later that her child had lived and had possibly been sold for adoption, grief consumes her.",
      "\u201cQuiet and fearless,\u201d the Los Angeles-based film critic Manuel Betancourt wrote of Ms. Coroy\u2019s understated performance, which revealed anguish behind a still face.",
      "\u201cI mouthed the words I was feeling in my head,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, explaining her acting method. \u201cIt was easier then because I was naturally timid. I\u2019m much more animated now.\u201d",
      "Her second film with Mr. Bustamante, \u201cLa Llorona,\u201d transformed a traditional Latin American ghost story into an indictment of a fictional dictator, but one clearly reminiscent of the Guatemalan leader, Gen. Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt. Five years before ",
      ", General R\u00edos Montt was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity for the systematic slaughter of Maya men, women and children in the 1980s after he took control of the country in a coup.",

      "The actress prefers not to discuss politics. But Mr. Bustamante said artists in Guatemala worked in an increasingly hostile climate.",
      "\u201cYou realize you\u2019re in a country where there is a dictatorship without that name,\u201d Mr. Bustamante wrote in an email interview. \u201cThere is a murky sort of oppression and no rights or freedom.\u201d",
      "When \u201cIxcanul\u201d was released, he wrote, \u201cthere was a general rejection by the Guatemalan people of this sort of subject matter. With La Llorona, it was much more dangerous. We received anonymous threats.\u201d",

A shaman gives her a drink that allows her to live and give birth underwater. When her winged son Namor, played by the Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta, returns to the Yucat\u00e1n, he sees Spaniards beating the Maya they have enslaved.",
      "In Guatemala, some Maya families encourage their children to speak only Spanish and wear Western clothing to escape ongoing rampant discrimination. But that\u2019s not how Ms. Coroy was raised.",
      "\u201cMy parents tell me I should be proud,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who eventually returned to night school and finished college. \u201cThere is no way that you can hide that you\u2019re Indigenous.\u201d",
      "She has recently begun delving into Maya spirituality. Her grandmother was a natural healer who taught her about the curative properties or herbal teas and flowers. While she worships in a Catholic church, she also studies with an Indigenous spiritual teacher and reads the Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh.",

      "Their search extended from Essex to Mystic, and after about eight months of looking, they found a property they \u201ccouldn\u2019t resist,\u201d he said. It was a 4,500-square-foot home on an acre in East Lyme, a town on Long Island Sound, in New London County.",
      "The Sayres submitted an offer last May and were disappointed when they lost out to another bidder. But when that deal subsequently fell through, the owner circled back to the couple and they closed in July for $500,000.",
      "Now raising a newborn daughter, they have grown fond of the restaurants and shops in downtown Niantic, one of two villages in this 34-square-mile community. And their neighbors, they say, couldn\u2019t be nicer. Overall, \u201cwe love the fact that it\u2019s clean, safe, peaceful and quiet,\u201d Mr. Sayre said.",
      "Julianne and Todd Cooke were living in northeastern Connecticut when they began scouting for property just before the pandemic. They were looking for a better school system for their youngest son and landed in East Lyme because of a nephew who had a good experience with the schools there.",
      "They found a three-story, two-bedroom waterfront home in a family-friendly beach community in Niantic, paying $424,100, and finished the basement so that Ms. Cooke, 42, a pediatric speech and language pathologist, can work with her young clients there.",
      "\u201cWe have beautiful beaches within a mile of our home,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking out for everyone in our community, and it\u2019s an excellent place to raise a child. There\u2019s an Easter egg hunt and a field day around the Fourth of July.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cthere\u2019s one way in and one way out of our neighborhood, so it feels very safe.\u201d",
      "With a population of roughly 19,000, East Lyme sits just outside the city of New London, directly off Interstate 95. The village of Niantic is in the part of town below the highway and along Long Island Sound.",
      "Dense, mostly year-round beach communities with private strips of sand line the Niantic Bay and Niantic River shorelines. The most exclusive of these, Old Black Point, claims the tip of a peninsula that juts into the Sound. Condominium complexes and 55-and-over developments are scattered throughout Niantic and the village of Flanders, on the northeastern side of town. Larger homes on expansive lots are set away from downtown, north of Interstate 95.",
      "Strip malls, pharmacies and fast-food restaurants cater to everyday needs along the major commercial corridors, while locally owned shops and restaurants draw visitors to Main Street in downtown Niantic. The village of Flanders is known for the seafood at Flanders Fish Market & Restaurant, on Route 161.",
      "In addition to its extensive shoreline, the community has several ponds and lakes, and considerable stretches of protected land. Oswegatchie Hills Nature Preserve, along the Niantic River, has numerous hiking trails winding through its 457 acres. Nehantic State Forest has a boat launch and picnicking facilities. The public beaches at Rocky Neck State Park attract lines of cars awaiting entry on summer mornings.",
      "The village of Niantic is also home to the York Correctional Institution, Connecticut\u2019s only prison for women.",
      "Inventory is very limited these days, so multiple bids on new listings are the norm. As of mid-April, there were 15 active listings for single-family homes, ranging from a 1,500-square-foot, three-bedroom house on 0.33 acres for $280,000, to a new six-bedroom modernist home on 4.5 acres for $5.95 million.",
      "\u201cWe all have buyers waiting in the wings,\u201d said Mary Poola, a broker with William Raveis.",
      "The median sale price for a single-family home for the 12 months ending on March 31 was $427,500, for which you can buy an older three-bedroom house in a neighborhood some distance from the beach, Ms. Poola said, or a cottage-style house on a small lot closer to the water. The median sale price for a condominium or townhouse for the 12 months ending in March was $320,000.",
      "The Norton, a new luxury condominium building with ground-floor retail on Main Street in Niantic, has raised the bar for condo prices in the area. The building\u2019s 12 units, which have access to a roof deck overlooking Niantic Bay, were priced from $425,000 for a one-bedroom to $1.195 million for a penthouse. All but two have sold.",
      "\u201cThe community was like, \u2018This is never going to happen. How can they ask that price?\u2019\u201d said Amanda Gaudette, the development\u2019s listing agent with William Pitt Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. \u201cThen they started pending, and then they started closing.\u201d",
      "The tight sales market has led to an equally squeezed rental market. As of last week, only about 17 rentals were available, some of them seasonal. \u201cI put one on for $2,100 a month recently, and we had swarms of people,\u201d Ms. Poola said. \u201cYou feel bad \u2014 the market is just so constricted.\u201d",
      "Downtown Niantic is the heart of the community. The stretch of Main Street along Niantic Bay draws locals and visitors alike to boutiques, shops, small restaurants and the Niantic Children\u2019s Museum. Across Main Street, on the bay, are a mile-long boardwalk, McCook Point Park and Hole-in-the-Wall Beach, which takes its name from the short tunnel beneath the railroad tracks used to reach the beach.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a beach town, but it\u2019s not like Watch Hill or Nantucket \u2014 it\u2019s very relaxed,\u201d Ms. Poola said, referring to pricier, better-known areas in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. \u201cYou can come off the beach, pull your hair back in a scrunchie and go to a restaurant downtown.\u201d",
      "A farmers\u2019 market operates downtown on Thursday afternoons from June through October.",
      "Just outside the town center, on West Main, the Book Barn invites shoppers to browse through thousands of used books that fill the main barn and several outbuildings.",
      "The East Lyme public school district serves roughly 2,600 students. About 70 percent of them identify as white, 10 percent as Hispanic or Latino, 10 percent as Asian and the remainder as two or more races; 23 percent qualify for free or reduced-price meals.",
      "Three elementary schools serve students in kindergarten through fourth grade: Flanders, Lillie B. Haynes and Niantic Center. The Integrated Preschool offers three- and five-hour daily programs for preschoolers with special needs along with their typically developing peers.",
      "Students in fifth through eighth grades attend East Lyme Middle School, which has an enrollment of about 750.",
      "East Lyme High School has about 1,000 students. The four-year graduation rate is 98 percent. In 2021-22, the average SAT scores were 572 in reading and writing and 557 in math, compared with state averages of 501 and 486.",
      "The East Lyme Aquatic and Fitness Center, on the high school campus, has a public swimming pool and gym. Memberships for residents are $40 a month for individuals and $60 a month for families.",
      "At Union Station, in New London, about 15 to 20 minutes away, commuters can catch Amtrak and CTrail Shoreline East trains. Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Regional train to Penn Station in New York City runs throughout the day and takes about three hours. A one-way coach ticket can cost up to $140.",
      "For service to Grand Central Terminal, commuters can take the Shoreline East train to New Haven and transfer to Metro-North, a trip that takes around three and a half hours in total. The one-way peak fare is about $34; a monthly pass is about $605.",
      "Union Station also offers ferry service to Long Island.",
      "The stone pavilion at Rocky Neck State Park was one of the largest projects built in the state under the federal government\u2019s Works Progress Administration, in the 1930s. The long, two-story cobblestone structure curves to follow the contours of a bluff facing Long Island Sound. The main level is an open hall with massive stone fireplaces and tree trunks serving as supports for the upper level, now reserved for weddings and other private functions.

      "The singer and his songs were highly religious. His concert venue, on a kibbutz developed by secular leftists, was definitely not. His audience of many hundreds? It was somewhere in between: some secular, some devout, an unusual blending of two sections of a divided Israeli society that rarely otherwise mix.",
      "Ishay Ribo, 34, is among a crop of young Israeli pop stars from religious backgrounds, some from Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, whose music is attracting more diverse listeners, and featuring prominently in the soundscape of contemporary Israeli life.",
      "This has surprised Mr. Ribo himself.",
      "\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d play to this kind of crowd,\u201d he said, backstage after the show earlier this year at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel, a town in northern Israel originally founded as a collective farm. A decade ago, he said, \u201cThis kind of crowd just didn\u2019t really exist.\u201d",
      "In addition to Mr. Ribo, other singers from a religious background \u2014 like Nathan Goshen, Hanan Ben-Ari, Akiva Turgeman and ",
      " \u2014 have also in recent years gained a wider audience. And their popularity reflects a changing Israeli society.",
      "The religious right has expanded its influence on politics and society, escalating a clash between secular and sacred visions of the country that ",
      ". At the same time, religion has taken on a more prominent, and less contentious, role in the mainstream music scene.",
      "In less than two decades, religious singers have moved from the cultural fringe to widespread acclaim, \u201cnot only among their people, but in all Israel,\u201d said Yoav Kutner, a leading Israeli music critic and radio presenter.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to the words,\u201d Mr. Kutner added, \u201cthey sound like Israeli pop.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo is perhaps the clearest example of this shift. Forgoing the erotic and the profane, his wholesome songs are often prayers to God \u2014 but sung to pop and rock music played by his band of guitarists. ",
      "Cause of causes",
      "he addresses God in one of his biggest hits. \u201cOnly you should be thanked for all the days and nights.\u201d",
      "In 2021, that track, \u201cSibat Hasibot,\u201d was the most played song on Israeli radio stations, religious and secular alike.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of my duty,\u201d Mr. Ribo said in a recent interview. \u201cTo be a bridge between these two worlds.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s journey toward that bridging role began in the early 2000s, on the bus to his religious school.",
      "His family had immigrated from France a few years before. They led an ultra-Orthodox and ascetic life on a settlement in the occupied West Bank, just outside Jerusalem.",
      "The family did not have a television, and Mr. Ribo attended an ultraconservative Jewish seminary. He listened to music on religious radio stations \u2014 often liturgical poems sung in synagogues. He typically heard secular music only on the bus to school, playing from the driver\u2019s radio.",
      "\u201cI had this musical ignorance,\u201d Mr. Ribo said.",
      "At age 11 or so, he began recording simple songs on a portable cassette player. Then as now, his lyrics were infused with piety, Mr. Ribo said. But the tunes were inspired by the mainstream singer-songwriters he\u2019d heard on the school bus.",
      "Some four years later, Mr. Ribo bought a guitar and formed a band with another seminary student. He began to practice and dress as a Modern Orthodox Jew, forgoing the dark coats and wide-brimmed hats of the ultra-Orthodox for jeans and sweaters.",
      "But his awareness of contemporary music and its customs was still patchy. At his band\u2019s first gig, Mr. Ribo played with his back to the audience, unaware of the need to engage with the crowd.",
      "Unlike many Israelis from ultra-Orthodox Jewish backgrounds, he paused his religious studies at age 22 to serve for two years as a conscript in the army. After finishing service in 2013, he tried to build a hybrid musical career \u2014 playing religious music to both secular and devout audiences.",
      "He imagined his melodies might sound like Coldplay, the popular British rock band, but his lyrics, he added, \u201cwould be about God and faith.\u201d",
      "The challenge was that there were few templates then for such a crossover career.",
      "Only a few religious artists, like the folk singer ",
      ", had built a secular following. The most successful religious artists were often those, like Etti Ankri and ",
      ", who had started out secular, became more devout, and then took their original audiences along with them.",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s problem, initially, was that the music industry \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what I had to offer,\u201d he said.",
      "When he sent his music to mainstream record labels, they all turned him down.",
      "Mr. Ribo forged ahead, self-releasing the first of five albums in 2014. He hired a secular manager, Or Davidson, who marketed him as if he was a secular client \u2014 booking him to play at mainstream venues and securing him airtime on nonreligious radio stations. Gradually, his secular fan base expanded.",
      "It was sometimes a fraught balancing act.",
      "Religious Jews criticized him for playing at secular concert halls. Secular Jews opposed his performances at religious venues where men and women sat separately. And when he played to both audiences at secular venues, the staff could not provide kosher food for his religious fans. Even his parents were too religiously observant to attend some of the venues.",
      "But the two-pronged approach ultimately worked. Four of his five albums were classified as gold or above \u2014 selling more than 15,000 copies in the small Israeli market. Secular pop legends, including Shlomo Artzi, began to perform duets with him, and he began to build an audience among diaspora Jews. Later this year, he is scheduled to headline Madison Square Garden, Mr. Davidson said.",
      "To an extent, Mr. Ribo\u2019s appeal is rooted simply in the catchiness of his songs, his clean-cut demeanor and sincere performances.",
      "\u201cEven though I\u2019m secular, I came to watch him because he\u2019s lovely,\u201d said Adiva Liberman, 71, a retired teacher attending his concert at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel.",
      "\u201cNot everyone is paying attention to the lyrics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re just attracted to the melody.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise comes amid not only a political shift rightward in Israel, but demographic changes as well. Religious Israelis, who have ",
      " than secular Israelis, are the fastest-growing part of the population, allowing them to exert greater cultural influence.",
      "Daniel Zamir, an Israeli jazz star who turned religious as an adult, said Mr. Ribo\u2019s broad appeal is part of \u201ca bigger process of Israeli society moving toward tradition.\u201d",
      "Simultaneously, Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise embodies a converse but complementary trend: greater willingness among some religious musicians to cater to and mix with mainstream audiences, and greater demand among religious audiences for music with a more contemporary sound.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca dual process,\u201d Mr. Zamir said. Mr. Ribo is emblematic of \u201cthis new generation that saw that you could be religious and also make great music,\u201d Mr. Zamir added.",
      "For some secular consumers, the rise of \u201cpop emuni\u201d \u2014 \u201cfaith pop\u201d in Hebrew \u2014 has been jarring. \u201cI am not interested in hearing prayers on my radio,\u201d ",
      " Gal Uchovsky, a television presenter, in a 2019 article about the proliferation of Mr. Ribo\u2019s music. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to explain to me, even in songs that brighten my journey, how fun God is.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s latest song, \u201cI Belong to the People,\u201d also caused discomfort among liberal Israelis. Released in early April, it is an attempt to unite Jews at a time of ",
      " in Israel. But critics said it unwittingly sounded condescending to people from other faiths, implying they were idolatrous.",
      "Mr. Ribo has also caused discomfort within the religious world. Some ultra-Orthodox Jews, particularly their religious leaders, feel he has delved too far into secular society.",
      "Early in his career, Mr. Ribo personally felt so conflicted about this that he sought his rabbi\u2019s approval for his work. To avoid alienating his religious base, there are still some lines he refuses to cross.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to write a classic love song \u2014 but I won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Ribo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job or duty.\u201d",
      "Still, some feel he has already compromised too much. In a popular ",
      " performed by an ultra-Orthodox comedy duo, an ultra-Orthodox man is asked if he knows any secular singers.",

      "In March, on Day 7 of the ",
      ", after the court spectacle had already been branded everything from a \u201cmeme machine\u201d to \u201cthe whitest trial of all time,\u201d the retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sat in the witness box, somewhat deflated already. By that point, he probably knew that his pursuit of Paltrow for damages connected to a ski collision he said was her fault was a pretty bad idea. Sanderson claimed that injuries he sustained during the 2016 ski crash (including, notably, a concussion) changed his life, turning him into \u201ca different person,\u201d and \u201ca crippled vet.\u201d Paltrow\u2019s lawyer, the languid, unflappably stone-eyed Stephen Owens, stood before him, presenting Facebook posts \u2014 a lot of Facebook posts, some taken months after the collision \u2014 as evidence of robust health.",
      "\u201cThis is a picture of you and your girlfriend, smiling big, right?\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile, camera, yup,\u201d Sanderson replied.",
      "And then, the deluge:",
      "Was this, Owens asked, Sanderson hiking with his girlfriend? Was this him taking a picture of a moose? Was this him, looking happy? Was this him hiking again, and smiling? With a cool backpack containing water? Scuba diving? At an auto show in Germany? A shooting range? BMX bike show? Was this Sanderson on a boat ride along canals in the Netherlands? Did he do bus tours? Or go to Morocco? Twice? Did he go to the this museum in Marrakesh? Was this him at a rock concert? At a ski resort? Out with drinking buddies? At an exhibit? Feeling happy? Looking fit and happy? Was this him \u201cdoing yoga, or momba, or what?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Zumba,\u201d Sanderson corrected. And yes.",
      "As far as controversies go, the trial was as Diamond Life as you can get. For about a week, it lived in the media as a jaunty low-stakes holiday from the high-stakes everything of our ongoing ",
      " Amid a news cycle of war and school shootings, recession and an indicted former president, it was an almost-delightful diversion to have this little legal whodunit, this simple question of who crashed into whom on a resort ski slope so luxurious it might as well be covered in cashmere.",
      "As much of a trifle as the trial was for viewers, it seemed to be a real inconvenience for Paltrow, who said she was injured by Sanderson and infamously claimed to have \u201clost half a day of skiing\u201d as a result of the crash. Sanderson seems to me like an opportunist with an appetite for attention, or at the very least a schlemiel, possibly a little vain. The retired optometrist, the jury made clear, crashed into Paltrow, making him the offender. Unsurprisingly, ",
      "But what frustrated me in this trial, particularly in the questioning above, was that Sanderson\u2019s claim that his life was changed by the concussion was over and over again challenged or dismissed. Part of the reason for this assertion seemed to stem from the fact that, well, he seemed to still have a life. Owens heavily implied that a man truly affected by a mild traumatic brain injury like a concussion couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t go hiking, or travel, or make it look on Facebook as if he were living the dream. Or maybe the frame of reasoning was more that somebody living with illness \u2014 in Sanderson\u2019s case an invisible illness \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be doing those things. He should be in bed, in the land of the sick, no visa, no passport.",
      "The category of invisible illness \u2014 which means exactly what it sounds like: an illness or disability not immediately apparent \u2014 is growing sharply in America. Through the wonders of medicine we\u2019ve become great at turning life-or-death illnesses, like diabetes, heart conditions or certain forms of cancer, into chronic conditions that can often be lived with. At the same time, diagnoses of hidden diseases like Crohn\u2019s or fibromyalgia are becoming increasingly common \u2014 as is long Covid, which on its own might have affected as many as 23 million Americans.",
      "Sanderson is really not a representative whom anybody living with invisible illness wants: a person who could very likely be exaggerating or appropriating symptoms for gain; a man who identifies as a victim diminished by injury and then goes scuba-diving and sits beaming like a prince on a Moroccan camel. As far as advocacy goes, it\u2019s not the best look.",
      "Yet as someone who has, for nearly the past 20 years, lived with invisible illness, I can tell you that it is a legitimate look. My personal complex of illness stems from an unusual neurological condition called spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome, which leads to a brain with an insufficient cushion around it. I also have post-concussion syndrome. In my own decades with sickness as a varyingly close companion, there have been many points at which my life was truly defined by pain and disability on the inside, but still looked pretty nice and zippy on paper (or Facebook). I had two kids, I moved cities, I traveled, I hosted events, I wrote books and articles, I got out of a marriage that wasn\u2019t working, I had boyfriends. Sometimes I did some of these things very slowly, as if from the middle of a lake of glue. Sometimes I did them white-knuckled, with a brain that felt like a fat, broiling whale bladder. Other times I was more fine \u2014 like now \u2014 and if someone were to encounter me on the street, they might assume I was 100 percent cured.",
      "What I am describing here is the between-space spectrum of functional illness, a zone occupied by many with invisible illnesses \u2014 with feet both in the world of the well and in the universe of the sick. The sociologist Arthur W. Frank has called this cohort \u201cremission society.\u201d But I prefer to think of it as a society of walking wounded, because the term better includes people affected by illnesses including lupus, Lyme disease, migraine, endometriosis and, yes, the stubborn remnants of concussion \u2014 all of which are more chronically pooh-poohed, disbelieved or gaslighted, not least by the medical community.",
      "Oddly, it\u2019s a realm Paltrow says she herself inhabits. Just a few days before the trial began, the actor and ",
      " in which she seemed to suggest that her normal daily food intake was composed of coffee, bone broth and vegetables \u2014 a therapeutic diet she says has been helping her get over her own symptoms of long Covid and other health issues. (Paltrow later clarified that she eats \u201cfull meals.\u201d) But the interview, which might have been strategically given to position Paltrow as a sick person who got uncomplainingly ill and then took care of her own business through an anti-inflammatory diet and a stiff upper lip (rather than blame and the courts), backfired: \u200bNot only did it make Paltrow look disordered and out of touch; it also put her own health issues into the same quotation marks as Sanderson\u2019s. An illness invisible, and thus relentlessly questioned.",
      "So, I don\u2019t believe that Sanderson is a victim of reckless Hollywood royalty on skis. But I do believe his brain injury. Because I know, intimately, what a brain injury can do. And I know that between illness and health, there really is no zero-\u200bsum game. A man can have a life forever altered by a concussion. And he can also Zumba.",

      "With his plunge in the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, Amir and his friends from the local diving club are honoring a tradition that goes back some 400 years \u2014 \u201cto the Middle Ages, during the Ottoman era,\u201d says Amir, wiping his face with a towel. \u201cWe are protecting our cultural heritage and keeping the passage over the bridge clean.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are the guardians of the Mostar Bridge,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first recorded dive from the bridge in Mostar \u2014 known as the Old Bridge, or Stari Most \u2014 took place in the 17th century, around 100 years after its construction. Since 1968, the city has held an annual summer diving competition, which attracts participants from all over the world.",
      "Braving the drop of around 75 feet (it varies with the height of the river), this extreme stunt requires a healthy dose of courage. But as Amir ascends from the river to the bridge, walking past the ancient stone stairs, the picturesque streets, the backdrop of musicians in the bazaar, he has another task. With a hat in his hand, he collects donations from the crowd of onlookers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m done with diving today,\u201d he exclaims, still balancing on the edge of the bridge \u2014 but this time extending his arm toward the crowd. \u201cNow I have to raise some money for our club.\u201d",
      "When I traveled to Bosnia with the photographer Alessio Mamo in July 2021, much of our trip took place in the shadow of the violence that tore through the region in the 1990s, when, as Yugoslavia broke apart, war erupted between three ethnonationalist groups: Orthodox Christian Serbs, Catholic Croats and Bosniaks, or Bosnian Muslims.",

      "We then drove to Sarajevo, the capital, and to Mostar, the bridge city.",
      "Within the last year, many Bosnians have feared that the country was once again ",
      ", though imminent fears have now calmed. Still, the bridge divers in Mostar offer a welcome sense of distraction and wonderment. I had previously seen them featured in a documentary, but it was only after arriving at the beautiful bridge that I could fully comprehend its architectural splendor and the value \u2014 and audacity \u2014 of the diving tradition.",

      "Amir, who was 24 when I met him, was not even born then. But another of the men in the diving club, Admir Delic, was 18 years old at the time, and, seeing his peers diving from the platform, he felt compelled to join them \u2014 despite the risks.",
      "\u201cIt was much more difficult and dangerous to dive from the gangway,\u201d Admir tells me. \u201cYou had to take a run-up, with the risk of getting hurt.\u201d But even today, every dive is still a challenge, he says, requiring the utmost concentration.",
      "There are days when Admir dives as many as 10 or 12 times, he says, in the peak tourist season, between July and August. I speak with him during his break, while he sips coffee in the club\u2019s lounge. Behind him on the wall are paintings and pictures of the bridge in different historical eras, and of divers during their marvelous feats.",
      "\u201cAs a young man from Mostar, I almost felt obliged to dive,\u201d he says. \u201cSooner or later, all of us males had to do it, like a rite of passage. I\u2019m among those who never stopped. It\u2019s my job.\u201d",

Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and an A.I. entrepreneur himself, has been one of the most prominent \u2014 and critical \u2014 voices in these discussions.

GPT-4 is pitched as this universal problem solver and can\u2019t even play a decent game of chess!

The same thing is happening right now. It is very easy for human beings to attribute awareness to things that don\u2019t have it. The cleverest thing that OpenAI did was to have GPT type its answers out one character at a time \u2014 made it look like a person was doing it. That adds to the illusion.

Who\u2019s going to bear the costs? Do we want the companies to put money into building tools to detect the misinformation that they\u2019re causing?

The notion was that\u00a0if you\u2019re going to deploy it on a\u00a0wide scale, let\u2019s say 100 million people,\u00a0then\u00a0you should have to build a safety case for it,\u00a0the way\u00a0you do in medicine. OpenAI kind of did a version of this with ",
      ". They said, \u201cHere are\u00a012\u00a0risks.\u201d But they didn\u2019t actually make a case that the benefits of people typing faster and having fun with chatbots outweighed the risks! Sam Altman has acknowledged that there\u2019s a risk of misinformation, massive cybercrime. OK, that\u2019s nice that you acknowledge it. Now the next step ought to be, before you have widespread release, let\u2019s have somebody decide:\u00a0Do those risks outweigh the benefits? Or how are we even going to decide that? And at the moment, the power to release something is entirely with the companies. It has to change.\n      "

      "Certain foods are too powerful to stay in the past.",
      ", named for the contorted patois of the French words brul\u00e9 (burned) and gueule (mouth), is a dish of dried salted cod, and has followed my family through generations, well beyond my mother\u2019s childhood in 1950s Trinidad.",
      "Every Friday night, my maternal grandmother, Elaine Cadet, whom everyone called Teacher, would make a saut\u00e9 using the flaked meat of boiled salted cod (or saltfish, as it\u2019s most commonly called in the Caribbean).",
      "She would zap it with a bevy of bright, grassy herbs, such as scallions and chadon beni (culantro), punchy aromatics, ripe sweet tomatoes, Scotch bonnet peppers and an assertive spray of fresh lime juice. It was always served \u2014 to her husband and five children \u2014 with coconut bake, a dense, sweetly scented unleavened bread made from the milk, oil and fresh pulp of the coconut.",
      "My mother, Anne Marie Ransome, taught me to make the dish in almost exactly the same manner, the only change being the inclusion of extra-virgin olive oil. And, now, from my home in Raleigh, N.C., I am carefully introducing my mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s recipe to my 6-year-old daughter, Noelle.",
      "As a child and teen on the island, I often witnessed my mother\u2019s delight in preparing the dish, a happiness rooted in memories of those Friday night dinners. But those moments of joy were brushed with pain, as I got a sense of the violent history that brought this saltfish to the table in front of me, one I would never wish repeated.",
      "Salted cod bridges centuries and cultures. A protein-rich, shelf-stable commodity, it found its way into many cuisines and became a no-frills feature of the diet of enslaved people.",
      "From the 16th to 19th centuries, plantation owners, unwilling to cede any land earmarked for sugar cane cultivation to grow crops for enslaved Africans, looked to abundantly cheap dried salted cod. After emancipation in Trinidad and Tobago, in 1838, saltfish continued to be a dietary staple for formerly enslaved people, becoming part of their lifestyle and eventual legacy. It remains an essential ingredient that reveals part of the islands\u2019 histories, while also offering a redemptive arc.",
      "Noelle doesn\u2019t quite get it. And understandably so.",
      "In her childlike assessment, saltfish looks like something that \u201ccame from the Halloween store.\u201d I chuckle, but, as gently as I can, remind her that engaging with these formative Trinidadian foods demands more because it delivers more. I\u2019m hoping that, by looking past the appearance of saltfish, she will come to understand herself within a greater context: the culture that carried the matriarchs before her \u2014 and learn, as I learned from my mother, that she can never forge a whole identity by overlooking any one of her parts.",
      "Bake and buljol is a part of Trinidad, so it\u2019s part of me.",
      "And part of her, too.",
      "As I knead the textured dough for coconut bake and the saltfish bubbles on the stovetop, I suspect that she perceives the recipe\u2019s power, how it preserves the past and immortalizes my granny, of whom only a few sepia-toned photographs remain. In making these dishes we are breathing back to life a part of the past and a people once devoured by loss. And death loses its sting. This food of incalculable worth makes us students of its history, while collapsing the gulf across four generations of Caribbean and American women."

      "Brice Samba was trying, as best he could, to share the crowning glory of his career with his wife. The goalkeeper\u2019s road to stardom had been a circuitous one. By\u00a0the time Samba was 24, he had played only a handful of senior games. He spent the next few years toiling in the second divisions of France and England.",
      "Now, though, it had all paid off. In March, not long before his 29th birthday, Samba was told he had been selected for France\u2019s squad for its upcoming European Championship qualifiers. He would be sharing a changing room with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Antoine Griezmann and the rest. He would wear the No. 1 jersey.",
      "Naturally, it was an achievement Samba wanted to celebrate with his wife, Jessica. He called her on FaceTime to revel in the moment together, but it did not \u2014 by his own admission \u2014 really work. He was, as he put it in an interview with the French sports newspaper L\u2019\u00c9quipe, too busy being \u201cjumped on\u201d by his delighted teammates at his club team, R.C. Lens.",
      "Samba\u2019s long-awaited call-up has not been the only thing Lens has had to celebrate in the last few months. He was probably exaggerating when he suggested this has been the \u201cbest season the club has had in 120 years\u201d \u2014 an assertion that the 1998 team, which won the French title, might reject \u2014 but not by much.",
      "Thanks in no small part to Samba, a key element in the most miserly defense in France, Lens started the season with a nine-game unbeaten run. It did not lose its second game until the start of February. It beat Monaco in Monte Carlo, Marseille in Marseille and then swept past Paris St.-Germain on home turf.",
      "Thierry Henry, no less, described Lens as the best team to watch in France. \u201cIt is contagious when you see a team going forward, fighting together, regardless of the starting 11,\u201d he said. As late as April, the Lens manager, Franck Haise, was being asked if his team \u2014 constructed on a shoestring by modern standards \u2014 had a chance of winning the title. \u201cWe can always dream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to forbid ourselves anything.\u201d",
      "In the end, that will most likely prove a step too far. Lens is currently six points behind P.S.G. with only five games to play. The emphasis now, for Haise, is on beating second-place Marseille again on Saturday and securing a place in the Champions League for the first time in two decades.",
      "The title, as was always probable, will be returning to Paris. When it gets there, though, it will find a club in a starkly different mood to Lens.",
      "These are ",
      ", though whether it is more troubled than any of the other times is not clear. Lionel Messi, the greatest player of all time, the jewel of the Qatari project to transform the club into a genuine European superpower, is currently on two weeks\u2019 unpaid suspension, having traveled without permission to Saudi Arabia for a family vacation.",
      "(\u201c",
      "\u201d Messi asked his 458 million Instagram followers this week. The answer, presumably, is \u201canyone who has seen your contract with the Saudi Tourism Authority.\u201d)",
      "In the circumstances, it seems reasonably unlikely that he will be signing a new contract when he returns to Paris. ",
      ": not Messi, who has always given the impression that his relationship with the club has been emotionless, transactional; not the club, which can now part with him at no financial or emotional cost; and not the P.S.G. fans, who have spent most of the last five months jeering him at every opportunity.",
      "That will not be the summer\u2019s only departure. A clutch of P.S.G. players, carrying the can for yet another year of disappointment in the Champions League, will be shipped out to make room for new signings.",
      "There is the lingering possibility that Neymar may be among them; it is possible that Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, his relationship with the club\u2019s hierarchy once again strained, might find his feet itching once again. Christophe Galtier, the manager, will not be around to coach, whatever happens. That job will go, instead, to whoever P.S.G. can find to manage them who is not Christophe Galtier.",
      "Winning yet another French title will make no difference to any of that. The club\u2019s fans will be pleased, of course, by the passing of another year in which none of its rivals had any cause to celebrate. But it is hard to discern any emotion approaching genuine joy. This is just how things are now.",
      "This will, after all, be P.S.G.\u2019s ninth French title in 11 years. It does not matter who the coach is. It scarcely matters who the players are. It makes no difference if the team is good, or bad, attractive, ugly, interesting, dull. It can win the league when it is riddled with dysfunction, falling apart behind the scenes. It can win the league when nobody is enjoying themselves. It can win the league and it changes nothing.",
      "In time, few at P.S.G. will remember much about this season. Not the good parts, anyway. There will be some dim recollection of Messi\u2019s unauthorized trip, of the surprising amount of greenery in Saudi Arabia, of Galtier\u2019s brief, unhappy stint in charge, but little else. It will blur, quickly, into nothing but a fuzzy outline of disappointment.",
      "Lens, by contrast, will end the season with nothing but happy memories, recollections of one of the finest campaigns in the club\u2019s long history. There will be no trophy to commemorate it, but no matter. The year that Samba was called up to the France team, that Lois Openda scored all those goals, that Haise might have won something, will be etched into legend.",
      "It is tempting to ask, then, which of those two teams has experienced the better season? Which has enjoyed themselves more? Soccer is, after all, about emotions as much as it is about glory, and the emotions on offer in the heart of Pas-de-Calais seem substantially healthier than those playing out in Paris.",
      "It is, though, perhaps better to ask whether all of that wealth, all of that power, has truly made P.S.G. happy, or whether \u2014 more than a decade on from the arrival of its Qatari backers \u2014 one of the richest clubs in the world, the pre-eminent force in French soccer, the team that employs Mbapp\u00e9 and Messi and Neymar, might look at little old Lens and think: That looks like fun.",
      "The journey, then, is complete. In the space of three short years, Leeds United has traversed the full range of soccer\u2019s theoretical spectrum: from Marcelo Bielsa at one end, with his unwavering belief in spectacle and romance and aesthetics, all the way to Sam Allardyce.",
      "There is, presumably, a parable in here somewhere. More than one, perhaps. It might be an example of how revolutions can only triumph if their leaders remain loyal to their principles. Or it might illustrate how pragmatism and compromise have a habit of intruding on even the purest, the most innocent, among us. It might be that ideas do not always survive an encounter with reality. It might be that they are abandoned too quickly by the callow and the plain.",
      "Either way, Leeds now stands as a curious case study. During Bielsa\u2019s tenure, it was not simply the outcome \u2014 promotion back to the Premier League, a top half finish \u2014 that restored pride to the team\u2019s fans, but the methods. Leeds had a style, an identity. The club, at long last, stood for something.",
      "Allardyce, appointed this week with the desperate, urgent task of somehow staving off relegation by sheer force of reputation, represents a permanent break with that. Allardyce is not always given the credit he deserves for the farsightedness he displayed early in his career, but he would not argue with the assertion that he is an outcome-oriented manager. He wants results. He does not much care how he gets them.",
      "Whether Leeds fans can buy into that, though, is a difficult question. They have spent the last few years, after all, cherishing the idea that the journey matters as much as the destination, internalizing the ",
      "logic that what you do is not as important as how you do it. Soccer has long believed that fans are happy if they are winning; everything else is window dressing. Leeds may provide a petri dish to find out.",
      "A torn hamstring \u2014 Grade 2C, six weeks out \u2014 was the least J\u00fcrgen Klopp deserved. His racing over to celebrate in the face of a slightly bemused and utterly undeserving fourth official in the aftermath of Liverpool\u2019s late winning goal against Tottenham last Sunday was, without question, an inherently ugly act. The Liverpool manager will, deservedly, be punished.",
      "Severely, too, because he has form for this sort of thing. He has already served one touchline ban this season. He can expect his second to be substantially longer, partly for the flagrancy of his offense and partly because the incident \u2014 broadcast live in the Premier League\u2019s flagship Sunday afternoon slot \u2014 was sufficiently high-profile that it has become a lightning rod for the State of Our Game. The Football Association, in these circumstances, feels compelled to look and act tough.",
      "It is not to excuse Klopp\u2019s actions, though, to suggest that \u2014 as ever \u2014 there is something missing from the conversation. Every so often, managers, coaches, players and fans are informed in arch, censorious tones that they must control their emotions better. They must not get too angry, or too impatient, or too passionate, or even, at times, too gleeful.",
      "And yet at no point does anyone seem to connect that emotionality with the sustained pitch of frenzy laced into the rhetoric that surrounds soccer: the constant calls, on broadcasts and in print, for players to be dropped or sold or replaced; for managers to change their methods or lose their jobs; for fans to fear or rage or despair.",
      "Is it any wonder that some of the participants in the game struggle to maintain their equanimity when they are endlessly informed that their jobs are on the line, that everything except eternal victory is failure, that each and every setback is evidence, deep down, of some moral shortcoming on their part?",
      "There is a reason that exists, of course: The soccer industry thrives on controversy and debate and drama and outrage. The people passing judgment act as observers when they are, in fact, participants. Klopp deserves to be barred. He needs, obviously, to calm down. He needs to control his emotions better. He is not, though, the only one.",
      "To return to a theme: Soccer does not, as a rule, know how to gauge relative success. Arsenal\u2019s (men\u2019s) team will, for example, spend much of the next month or so having its very character pored over and picked apart and dredged for clues as to why, exactly, it did not win the Premier League title.",
      "The fact that this in itself represents a considerable triumph \u2014 that Arsenal was in a position to be criticized for not winning the Premier League \u2014 will receive considerably less attention.",
      "With any luck, the club\u2019s women\u2019s team will avoid the same fate. On Monday night, Arsenal lost at the death in the semifinals of the Women\u2019s Champions League: a single lapse, after more than two and a half hours of soccer, from Lotte Wubben-Moy that allowed Pauline Bremer to sweep Wolfsburg to a 5-4 aggregate victory.",
      "It would be possible, of course, to point out that the ongoing failure of the clubs of the Women\u2019s Super League to establish some sort of competitive dominion in Europe is, given their financial edge, a substantial disappointment. Or to suggest that Arsenal, with home-field advantage and an early goal, had lacked the composure to see the game out. Or to take the path of least resistance and just blame Wubben-Moy for being caught in possession.",
      "But again: Success is relative. Arsenal made it to the last minute of extra time in the semifinals of the Champions League without its captain, Kim Little, and its three best players, Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema, all of them victims of long-term knee injuries. Getting so far, coming so close, in those circumstances, is not failure. It is quite the opposite.",
      "Never let it be said that this newsletter does not confront the most pressing issues in sports: corruption, engagement, how to get your dog into soccer games. \u201cI would suggest you approach a club and offer him as a mascot,\u201d ",
      "wrote. \u201cYou might have to teach him some tricks: bark when the opposition scores, growl at the referee, jump on the opposing manager.\u201d",
      "This is a perfectly valid suggestion for most dogs. Sadly, it does not apply to my dog, who needs to be in my presence at all times for his own peace of mind and who has a steadfast objection to learning anything. He does have a natural indisposition toward authority figures, though, so he could probably tick the \u201cgrowling at the referee\u201d box.",
      "The good news is that ",

      "asked. \u201cIt would give the team a scoring opportunity that isn\u2019t brutally punished, as it is with a penalty.\u201d Great question, Doug, because this seems perfectly logical to me.",

    "name": "Charles III\u2019s Coronation: Music That Made Kings and Queens",
    "author": "By Imani Danielle Mosley",

      "The coronation ceremony of King Charles III and Camilla, the queen consort, on Saturday has been described as a millennium-old tradition of pomp and circumstance, reaching back to Charles\u2019s most distant forebears.",
      "But while the service and liturgy of the coronation of English and British monarchs stretches back to the 10th century, the tradition of its sound is far more recent \u2014 and less noticed. Many of the accounts of coronations before the 19th century have been lost, and the ones that remain make very little mention of music, if at all.",
      "The sound of the British coronation that has become so affixed in the cultural landscape is, in fact, a 20th-century invention, in a concerted effort to present the past as the present.",
      "Charles III has commissioned new works for his coronation, adding to the rich tapestry of pieces composed for the occasion. Here is a brief history of that music, exploring the sound of the divine right of kings.",
      "The first coronation of an English monarch that resembles what we see today was for Edgar in 973. This coronation provided the overall structure that has been filled out since the 10th century: the procession and recognition, the oath, the anointing, as well as the investiture, enthronement and homage. The coronation itself is a religious ceremony, centered around the Eucharist, and so, from 973 to 1603, the coronation ended with a Catholic mass.",
      "In 1382, the \u201cLiber Regalis\u201d (\u201cRoyal Book\u201d) was written to provide a detailed account of the coronation order of service, likely for Anne of Bohemia. The book",
      "provides the coronation text but gives no information on the music itself; coronations would have music composed specifically for them, and some works only became fixed in later centuries. The first coronation music was likely sung chants, which, starting in 1603 with the coronation of James I, were refashioned into coronation anthems now with English text.",
      "Music by more familiar composers appears with the coronation of James II. One of Henry Purcell\u2019s settings of \u201cI was glad\u201d is used for the entrance anthem. Also known by its Latin name, \u201cLaetatus sum,\u201d the text is a setting of Psalm 122. The anthem is in two parts, beginning with a bright and lilting section in triple meter marking James\u2019s entrance into Westminster Abbey.",
      "As James ascended the stairs toward the Chair of Estate, the King\u2019s Scholars from the Westminster School shouted \u201cVivat\u201d (also known as the Acclamation); this was the first coronation where that tradition was present. The second section, now in minor and in duple time, acts as a solemn prayer of peace and prosperity for the monarch and the nation. The section ends with the \u201cGloria Patri\u201d (\u201cGlory be\u201d), and it is this Purcell version that inspired the tripartite structure for C.H.H. Parry\u2019s setting of \u201cI was glad\u201d in use today.",
      "George II\u2019s coronation is perhaps best known for introducing George Frideric Handel\u2019s coronation anthems, including \u201cZadok the Priest\u201d (HWV 258), along with several others. It is unknown, however, where in the service each coronation anthem was performed. \u201cZadok the Priest\u201d sets text from 1 Kings 1:38-40, text that has appeared in some form at every coronation since Edgar.",
      "The anthem begins with a lengthy orchestral introduction, building tension up to the entrance of the choir, accompanied by pealing brass and timpani. It is believed that the introduction was written to help provide flow in the order of service, specifically giving time for the monarchs to change robes in preparation for the anointing. The anthem also includes the acclamation \u201cGod save the King! Long live the King!\u201d \u2014 linking the anointing to the later acclamation from the Homage of the Peers, where those with hereditary titles swear fealty to the monarch.",
      "The coronation of Queen Victoria is the first time the ",
      ", in part because of George Smart, who was in charge of the coronation\u2019s music. The service features the Handel coronation anthems \u201cZadok the Priest\u201d and \u201cThe Queen Shall Rejoice,\u201d as well as the Hallelujah chorus from \u201cMessiah,\u201d",
      "which took place after Victoria received communion. The reliance on Handel and the lack of new musical material \u2014 except for one new anthem, \u201cThis is the day,\u201d by William Knyvett \u2014 resulted in widespread criticism of the service, with The Spectator",
      "writing that \u201cthe musical part of the service was a libel on the present state of art in this country.\u201d",
      "It is with Edward VII\u2019s coronation that music becomes a significant part of the service, by royal decree. Frederick Bridge, in charge of the music for the coronation, wrote that \u201cthe King was most explicit in declaring his Command that there should be no curtailment of the musical part of the service,\u201d when cuts were being made to shorten the service because of Edward\u2019s health.",
      "For the first time, music was incorporated in the published order of service, including compositions performed both before and after the coronation. This featured marches by Wagner, Gounod, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Tchaikovsky and Elgar, whose \u201cImperial March\u201d had been written for Victoria\u2019s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. Within the coronation service, Bridge outlined a program that would connect centuries of English church music together from Tallis to Parry, aiming to highlight Britain\u2019s imperial might by showcasing the long centuries of its artistic power.",
      "Bridge commissioned new coronation anthems for the service, notably \u201cI was glad\u201d by C.H.H. Parry and a new setting of the \u201cConfortare\u201d",
      "by Walter Parratt, Master of the King\u2019s Musick. Both have since become staples in the coronation service. Parry\u2019s setting of \u201cI was glad\u201d is resoundingly jubilant, opening with brass over a full orchestra in a fanfare, before giving way to the chorus\u2019s unaccompanied entrance. Parry incorporates the vivats into the anthem; here they are sung by the choir, punctuated by brass echoes and snare drums, while excising the \u201cGloria Patri.\u201d Parratt\u2019s \u201cConfortare\"",
      "(\u201cBe strong and play the man\u201d) revived a text not used since the 17th century. Parratt\u2019s arrangement takes the antiphon from recited chant to full chorus with fanfare-like brass accompaniment.",
      "The accession of Elizabeth II prompted the idea of a new Elizabethan age, one that would rival the artistic, cultural and military achievements of the 16th century, connecting postwar Britons with the glory of their ancestors. The coronation showcased that idea by featuring music by the premiere contemporary British composers: Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arnold Bax, Herbert Howells, Arthur Bliss, George Butterworth, Gordon Jacob, Charles Villiers Stanford, Gustav Holst, John Ireland and William Walton.",
      "And at the most recent coronation, comparisons between Elizabeth II and Charles III are unsurprisingly being made. Composers writing music for this coronation include both expected and unexpected names, including Judith Weir, Master of the King\u2019s Music; Tarik O\u2019Regan; Paul Mealor; and Shirley Thompson; there will be a new coronation anthem from Andrew Lloyd Webber.",
      "Charles III\u2019s coronation is set to usher in the new Carolean era, in the hopes that it will reflect its namesake Charles II and his contributions to art and music. Only the coronation and time will show if this new era lives up to that promise."

      "Texas was gasping for electricity. Winter Storm Uri had knocked out power plants across the state, leaving tens of thousands of homes in icy darkness. By the end of Feb. 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died, some from the freezing cold.",
      "Meanwhile, in the husk of a onetime aluminum smelting plant an hour outside of Austin, row upon row of computers were using enough electricity to power about 6,500 homes as they raced to earn Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.",
      "The computers were performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for an elusive combination of numbers that Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm would accept. About every 10 minutes, a computer somewhere guesses correctly and wins a small number of Bitcoins worth, in recent weeks, about $170,000. Anyone can try, but to make a business of it can require as much electricity as a small city.",
      "In Texas, the computers kept running until just after midnight. Then the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them shut off, under an agreement that allowed it to do so if the system was about to fail. In return, it began paying the Bitcoin company, Bitdeer, an average of $175,000 an hour to keep the computers offline. Over the next four days, Bitdeer would make more than $18 million for not operating, from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm.",
      "The New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as Bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs \u2014 including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution \u2014 for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with Bitcoin.",
      "Until June 2021, most Bitcoin mining was in China. Then it drove out Bitcoin operations, at least for a time, citing their power use among other reasons. The United States quickly became the industry\u2019s global leader.",
      "Since then, precisely how much electricity Bitcoin mines are using in America and their effect on energy markets and the environment have been unclear. The Times, using both public and confidential records as well as the results of studies it commissioned, put the most comprehensive estimates to date on the largest operations\u2019 power use and the ripple effects of their voracious demand.",
      "It is as if another New York City\u2019s worth of residences were now drawing on the nation\u2019s power supply, The Times found.",
      "In some areas, this has led prices to surge. In Texas, where 10 of the 34 mines are connected to the state\u2019s grid, the increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly 5 percent, or $1.8 billion per year, according to a simulation performed for The Times by the energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.",
      "The additional power use across the country also causes as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to America\u2019s roads, according to an analysis by WattTime, a nonprofit tech company. Many of the Bitcoin operations promote themselves as environmentally friendly and set up in areas rich with renewable energy, but their power needs are far too great to be satisfied by those sources alone. As a result, they have become a boon for the fossil fuel industry: WattTime found that coal and natural gas plants kick in to meet 85 percent of the demand these Bitcoin operations add to their grids.",
      "Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, like factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.",
      "In some states, notably New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, Bitcoin operators\u2019 revenue can ultimately come from other power customers. The clearest example is Texas, where Bitcoin companies are paid by the grid operator for promising to quickly power down if necessary to prevent blackouts. In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down and instead earn additional money while doing exactly what they would have been doing anyway: seeking Bitcoin. Five operations have collectively made at least $60 million from that program since 2020, records show.",
      "Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.",
      "The windfall for Bitdeer during Winter Storm Uri came through this program, in exchange for a fraction of the power it typically used. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Another Bitcoin company made tens of millions of dollars reselling electricity during the storm \u2014 and ultimately stands to earn as much as $125 million \u2014 according to its financial filings, which were previously reported by the ",
      ". A third company ",
      " that another natural disaster like Uri could be a significant business opportunity.",
      "\u201cIronically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid,\u201d said Ed Hirs, who teaches energy economics at the University of Houston and has been critical of the industry.",
      "In interviews and statements, many of the companies said they were no different from other large power users except for their willingness to shut off quickly to benefit the grid. Several objected to the method The Times and WattTime used to estimate their emissions, which calculated the pollution caused by the additional power generated to satisfy the mines\u2019 demand, showing it to overwhelmingly come from fossil fuels.",
      "The companies said this method held them to an unfair standard.",
      "\u201cThe analysis cited could be used to attack any industry that consumes power,\u201d said David Fogel, the chief executive of Coinmint, which operates in upstate New York. \u201cI think the entire notion of singling out specific industries like this is unfair.\u201d",
      "But WattTime\u2019s method is the one many energy and climate experts recommend for measuring the environmental effects of increased power use by any industry, particularly one that grows so large so suddenly.",
      "Some in the industry have pushed back against suggestions that it is directly responsible for any environmental harm.",
      "A May 2022 ",
      " to the Environmental Protection Agency, signed by many of the biggest companies, said their operations \u201creleased\u201d no pollutants. \u201cBitcoin miners have no emissions whatsoever,\u201d it said. \u201cAssociated emissions are a function of electricity generation.\u201d",
      "Nic Carter, a partner at a crypto-focused venture capital firm and a",
      "prominent Bitcoin advocate who told The Times he was the letter\u2019s primary author, said he was playing a \u201clanguage game\u201d when he wrote that Bitcoin mining has no emissions. At the time, he said, he felt the industry was being unfairly singled out.",
      "\u201cMaybe the more sincere point is like, we\u2019re already fully aware of the emissions associated with utilities generating grid power,\u201d he said.",
      "Many academics who study the energy industry said Bitcoin mining was undoubtedly having significant environmental effects.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re adding hundreds of megawatts of new demand when we already face the need to rapidly cut fossil power,\u201d said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor who studies electrical grid emissions.",
      "\u201cIf you care about climate change,\u201d he added, \u201cthen that\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "Bitcoin, conceived in 2008, introduced most of the world to the concept of cryptocurrencies. Instead of trusting banks to track the value of accounts, the system publishes transactions on a public ledger called a blockchain. Proponents said that cutting out middlemen would free people from financial institutions, government oversight and fees.",
      "So-called mining is a fundamental part of the system: When a computer guesses correctly, it updates the ledger and collects six and a quarter new Bitcoins. Then the guessing game begins again.",
      "Initially, hobbyists could win with personal computers, but as the value of each Bitcoin soared \u2014 from under $1,000 in 2017 to above $60,000 in 2021 \u2014 mining increasingly became an industrial endeavor. (The price has since dropped and, as of publication, was roughly $28,000.)",
      "The only way for miners to better their odds is to add computing power, which requires more electricity. But as the number of guesses increases, the algorithm makes the game more difficult. This has created an energy arms race.",
      "The mines\u2019 scale can draw gasps from people in the power industry. A one-megawatt mine consumes more energy each day than a typical U.S. home does in two years. The electricity coursing through a 100-megawatt operation at a given moment could power about half the homes in Cleveland, according to federal data.",
      "Aspects of the industry have previously been ",
      " in news articles and ",
      " and ",
      ", including broad estimates of the environmental effects. But The Times cross-referenced financial disclosures, land records and satellite imagery to create the first national accounting of the biggest operations. The analysis includes mines operating at approximately 40 megawatts or higher, although dozens more exist below that threshold.",
      "Of course, other industries, including metals and plastics manufacturing, also require large amounts of electricity, causing pollution and raising power prices. But Bitcoin mines bring significantly fewer jobs, often employing only a few dozen people once construction is complete, and spur less local economic development.",
      "Their financial benefit flows almost exclusively to their owners and operators. In 2021, the year Bitcoin\u2019s price peaked, 20 executives at five publicly traded Bitcoin companies together received nearly $16 million in salary and over $630 million in stock options, records show.",
      "The industry has been less profitable since then, as Bitcoin\u2019s value has dropped and electricity prices have climbed. Two of the largest United States-based companies have filed for bankruptcy. Still, new mines continue to open across the country",
      "There are ways to operate a cryptocurrency using far less electricity. Last year, Ethereum, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, reduced the electricity needed to power the network by more than 99 percent by switching its algorithm. Now it rewards people and trusts them to update the ledger because they are willing to put up their own money as collateral, not because they have spent money to power guessing computers, as Bitcoin does.",
      "But Bitcoin advocates oppose changing their algorithm, saying that it has proved resistant to attacks for longer and at a greater scale than any other approach. In practice, they say, the more computers making guesses, the safer the network.",
      "As Bitcoin mining has spread, countries around the world have found that operations strained their power grids. In 2019, China declared the industry \u201c",
      "\u201d and banned it in 2021. Many operations moved to ",
      " and ",
      ", which also enacted restrictions.",
      "And shipping pallets piled high with Bitcoin-mining computers ",
      ", where some states welcomed them in.",
      "Just north of Jamestown, N.D., the land is flat, trees are scarce and, in winter, snow drifts can easily top 10 feet. Even when brisk prairie winds blow, the shrill whine of the fans within Applied Digital\u2019s Bitcoin mine can be heard a half-mile away.",
      "They are working to cool more than 30,000 computers, stacked two stories high, stretching for hundreds of feet alongside signs that read \u201cDanger \u2014 High Voltage.\u201d The radiating heat melts the snow on one side of each of the operation\u2019s eight buildings.",
      "The mine has 33 employees and uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as all the homes in the 16,000-person town. It is one of three mines in the state that together consume nearly as much power as every home in North Dakota.",
      "Few other states have been as welcoming to Bitcoin companies. In October 2021, Gov. Doug Burgum presented an ",
      " to local officials and a power provider for bringing a mine to Grand Forks. Months later, he announced the development of a $1.9 billion Bitcoin operation in Williston. And last spring, he ",
      " a switch at the Jamestown mine\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony.",
      "The Bitcoin operations\u2019 effect on the state\u2019s economy is simple, said Josh Teigen, the commerce commissioner: \u201cThey are propping up our fossil fuel industry, and that\u2019s exactly what we want.\u201d",
      "North Dakota has an abundance of lignite, a type of coal primarily used to generate electricity. Mr. Teigen said the state hopes to ultimately",
      "capture the carbon from fossil fuel power plants and store it underground, reducing emissions while keeping the coal industry alive",
      "The state also has a large amount of wind power, which is what attracted",
      "Applied Digital, said Wes Cummins, its chief executive.",
      "His company is not alone. Many Bitcoin businesses promote their ability to operate in rural areas where renewable energy is abundant.",
      "But those claims have hit a hard reality: A vast majority of that renewable energy would be used even in the absence of the mines, so fossil fuel plants almost always need to produce additional electricity as a result of their operations.",
      "For example, the Jamestown mine\u2019s power demand causes coal or natural gas energy providers to generate electricity more than 90 percent of the time, WattTime found.",
      "Using a technique known as ",
      ", WattTime examined each mine\u2019s location and power use, identified which types of power plants had generated the additional energy needed, and estimated the resulting pollution. That method, and WattTime in particular, were recommended in a report by the Crypto Climate Accord, an initiative to reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint supported by more than 200 cryptocurrency companies.",
      "The analysis found that the 34 mines\u2019 power use was causing nearly 16.4 million tons of carbon pollution each year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d Mr. Cummins said, when told the estimates for Applied Digital\u2019s Jamestown operation. He said his operation uses the electricity that is available on the grid and cannot control whether it comes from clean or dirty sources, which is affected by all customers\u2019 demand. The miners generally prefer calculating emissions based on that mix of power.",
      "Using that method, WattTime estimated that they consume 54 percent fossil fuel-generated power, resulting in nearly 10.4 million tons of carbon emissions.",
      "Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, a Bitcoin lobbying group, said in an email that the industry incentivizes the development of new renewable and natural gas plants. But power industry experts say that while some current wind farms may be benefiting modestly, renewable generation takes years to build and usually requires commitments from customers who can guarantee that they will buy power for a decade or more.",
      "According to Dr. Jenkins at Princeton, the Bitcoin operations\u2019 near-constant power demand is more likely to keep fossil fuel plants in business than to lead to more renewable energy.",
      "This proved true in upstate New York, where a gas-powered plant reopened and now powers a Bitcoin mine. Three other large operations are run by companies that also own the fossil fuel plants where they operate, including two burning waste coal in Pennsylvania.",
      "Some of the Bitcoin companies that WattTime found to be causing the most pollution have held themselves out as supporting renewables.",
      "For example, Riot Platforms\u2019 chief executive described Bitcoin mining as \u201cuniquely beneficial and supportive of renewable energy.\u201d Ninety-six percent of the power demand added by the company\u2019s mine was met by fossil fuels, the WattTime analysis showed.",
      "Mining Bitcoin produces steady revenue, but using so much electricity can also be a business model.",
      "Moments of extreme weather provide especially stark examples. Take June 23, 2022 \u2014 the eighth straight day of near-100-degree temperatures around Austin, which allowed Riot Platforms to demonstrate several ways they can turn electricity into money.",
      "Like many industrial buyers, the company had prepurchased its power at a fraction of the price available to residential customers. Riot\u2019s mine runs at 450 megawatts \u2014 the largest in the country.",
      "Each day that June, its computers\u2019 guesses were winning Bitcoin worth an average of about",
      "$342,000. But the company had two additional ways to improve its profit margins.",
      "First, it had signed up for the Responsive Reserve Service, a Texas power grid program that offers a way to quickly reduce strain if the grid becomes overloaded, acting as insurance against blackouts. The program pays miners, and other companies, for promising to stop using electricity upon request. In reality, they are rarely asked to shut down, but are still paid for making the pledge.",
      "From midnight to nearly 4 p.m. on June 23, Riot earned more than $42,000 from the program while continuing to mine Bitcoin. (Overall in 2022, Riot made nearly $9.3 million from participating in the program nearly 85 percent of the time, the data shows, though the grid operator asked companies to actually lower their use for about 3.5 hours.)",
      "Around that time, the company switched to the second technique: avoiding fees that Texas charges to maintain and strengthen the power grid. It did so by briefly shutting off almost completely.",
      "To incentivize big customers to conserve electricity, those fees are based on how much electricity they use during several peak summer moments. Riot reduced its power use by more than 99 percent.",
      "By 6:30 p.m., the company had resumed mining. If Riot had been fully operating all day, it would have incurred an estimated $5.5 million in fees \u2014 costs that are largely made up by other Texans. Over the course of the year, this saved Riot more than $27 million in potential fees.",
      "The company\u2019s actions were described in data published by the Texas grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT. Though the records refer to power suppliers by pseudonyms, The Times was able to identify six of the 10 Texas operations in the data.",
      "One final mechanism lets some companies make extra money when electricity prices spike: They can stop mining and resell electricity to other customers. That earned Riot roughly $18 million last year.",
      "From Bitcoin mining, the company earned $156.9 million last year.",
      "Five of the six Texas mines in the power grid data participate in the Responsive Reserve program. All six chose to turn off nearly every time fees were assessed in 2022, saving an estimated $62 million in fees.",
      "When asked whether Bitcoin companies are disproportionately able to take advantage of both programs, ERCOT said in a statement that it \u201cdoes not discriminate based on the type or activity\u201d of the companies that sign up.",
      "It is not unusual for companies in Texas to be able to anticipate moments when fees will be assessed and to reduce their demand, but unlike Bitcoin miners, most can stop using on average 5 percent to 30 percent of their electricity, industry consultants say.",
      "In a statement, Riot said it reducing its power load helped all power customers.",
      "\u201cThe company\u2019s decision to actively reduce its load during anticipated times of peak demand adds to grid reliability and ultimately helps to reduce peak power prices,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Mr. Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council said the benefits outweigh the cost.",
      "\u201cIn addition to providing jobs and positive economic impact, Bitcoin miners turn off when power prices rise and that power is then available for commercial and residential users,\u201d he said.",
      "Others say the companies are capitalizing on weaknesses in programs designed for very different industries.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re exploiting the system,\u201d said Severin Bornstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies electricity pricing. \u201cBut they will say, \u2018You know, the system was already there,\u2019 and I\u2019m sympathetic to that in some ways.\u201d",
      "After accounting for the savings and revenue from each of the strategies, Riot told investors its electricity cost in 2022 was 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour.",
      "By comparison, the average price for other industrial businesses in Texas was 7.2 cents.",
      "For",

      "In a nod to the ongoing risk the coronavirus poses to millions of Americans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Wednesday that adults 65 and older and those with weakened immune systems receive another dose of the reformulated booster that debuted last fall.",
      "The endorsement followed a daylong discussion by the C.D.C.\u2019s expert advisers. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the booster plan on Tuesday, and the C.D.C.\u2019s recommendation was the final administrative step. Eligible Americans will be able to receive booster doses immediately.",
      "Federal health officials are also phasing out the original vaccine formulas created by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, revoking their authorizations in the United States. And instead of needing an initial series of two shots, unvaccinated people will now require just a single dose of the reformulated, or \u201cbivalent,\u201d Covid shot to be considered vaccinated.",
      "Until now, federal officials had required two doses of the older vaccine before recipients could begin to receive the bivalent boosters, a process some experts felt was confusing.",
      "Limited data on the reformulated vaccines indicate that in older adults, the shots offer ",
      " against severe disease and death from Covid, although the protection wanes rapidly in the weeks after inoculation.",
      "There are about ",
      " adults 65 and older in the United States, accounting for about 16 percent of the population, according to the Census Bureau. And ",
      " Americans have weak immune systems because of an illness or a medication.",
      "Roughly 250 people in the United States are ",
      " from Covid-related causes each day, a vast majority of whom are over 70 or have impaired immune systems. The median age of those hospitalized is 75, according to the C.D.C. Yet only about 43 percent of adults 65 and older have received a bivalent booster shot so far.",
      "By this point, most Americans have built up some immunity against the virus, whether through prior infections, vaccinations or both. The new guidelines acknowledge as much, but allow for those still at high risk from the virus to protect themselves, and to do so free of charge.",
      "\u201cThe one-size-fits-all policy was simple but not optimal,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician and health policy expert at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe new regimen acknowledges that there\u2019s now an extraordinary spectrum of Covid risk, from mild to massive, depending on who you are.\u201d",
      "People who are severely immunocompromised, such as organ transplant recipients, may want to opt for booster shots every six months or even more frequently, Dr. Faust said.",
      "The new guidelines come weeks after ",
      " and ",
      " recommended additional shots for older adults and immunocompromised people, among others. ",
      "The C.D.C. now says that adults 65 and older may opt for another dose of the bivalent vaccine at least four months after their first shot. Those with weakened immune systems may do so two months after their previous bivalent dose, and may choose to receive more doses in consultation with their health care provider.",
      "In the meeting of C.D.C. advisers on Wednesday, Dr. Camille Kotton, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, noted that the new recommendations did not include immunocompromised children 6 months through 4 years of age. That leaves those medically frail children \u2014 including recipients of organ transplants \u2014 unprotected against the virus, she said.",
      "\u201cAs a mom and doctor, this seems like we are leaving them so vulnerable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "For most Americans, the F.D.A. plans to encourage annual Covid shots in the fall, much as it does with flu shots. Health officials will decide on the exact composition of the shot in June, based on the version of the virus circulating at the time.",
      "The bivalent vaccine targets the original variant of the coronavirus as well as variants BA.4 and BA.5, which were dominant last summer. But BA.4 and BA.5 were quickly supplanted by newer versions.",
      "The most recent Omicron subvariant, ",

      "Federal health officials also are making changes to the process for those receiving the initial shots.",
      "Unvaccinated people will receive a single dose of the bivalent vaccine, rather than multiple doses of the original monovalent vaccine. The rationale is that most unvaccinated Americans now presumably have some measure of immunity from a prior infection and may not need two doses at the beginning, the F.D.A. said.",
      "Some experts were sharply critical of the advice. Reams of data suggest that the vaccines are most protective when given in two doses and followed by one or more boosters to reinforce the shield, said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College.",
      "\u201cF.D.A. has consistently over-interpreted the performance of the bivalent formulation when given as a booster,\u201d Dr. Moore said. \u201cNow it seems to have gone beyond the science and decided it has some kind of magic power as a first dose.\u201d",
      "It may be reasonable to assume that nearly all unvaccinated adults have already been infected at least once and can get by with just a single dose, said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.",
      "\u201cI guess the F.D.A. is just trying to simplify given the reality on the ground,\u201d he said. But \u201cimmunologically, you\u2019d want to get two shots if it\u2019s your first exposure.\u201d",
      "The agency could instead recommend two doses of a bivalent vaccine and say that those who know of a prior infection can elect to forego the second dose, Dr. Bhattacharya said. But, he added, \u201cin reality, I doubt a clause like that would make much practical difference.\u201d",
      "The F.D.A. said it had \u201ccarefully reviewed the available epidemiologic evidence, scientific publications and data provided by sponsors indicating that a single bivalent vaccine dose provided to individuals previously infected with Covid-19 provides an immune response equal to, or superior to, two doses of the original vaccine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe agency believes that this approach will help encourage future vaccination, particularly among those who have not chosen to be vaccinated to date,\u201d the F.D.A. said in its statement."

And with one of the strongest presences in Asia of any Western lender, the firm is considered well positioned to benefit as China\u2019s economy rebounds from pandemic lockdowns. The lender in recent years has sought to focus more on its Hong Kong and mainland China operations, including by moving to sell businesses in less important markets.",
      "But to Ping An and some other investors, the bank has not done enough to bolster its China-facing businesses, and has instead siphoned off money from them to buttress slower-growing operations in the West. The insurer is also worried about the firm being hurt by geopolitical tensions between China and the West.",
      "Over the past year, Ping An \u2014 a behemoth in its own right, as the world\u2019s largest insurance firm \u2014 has privately and then publicly pressured HSBC to break off the Asian business in some way. Last month, it publicly backed shareholder initiatives that would force the firm to regularly review its global structure, as well as to return its dividend to prepandemic levels.",
      "HSBC executives dismissed the initiatives as shortsighted and risky, and urged investors to reject them. They were supported by several proxy advisory firms, which counsel investors on how to vote in corporate elections and often have sway among shareholders."

      "A group of regional bank stocks that ",
      ", stoking fears of a spiraling banking crisis, surged on Friday, at least partly alleviating those worries.",
      "The rebound came as the market was also bolstered by data on hiring that was deemed strong enough to soften concerns about a recession without prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws on the economy further.",
      "PacWest soared over 80 percent, after falling over 50 percent on Thursday. Western Alliance\u2019s share price rose almost 50 percent, also recouping a chunk of its drop the day before.",
      "The relief rally helped to lift the broader market, with the S&P 500 up 1.9 percent, its first day of gains in May.",
      "\u201cWe thought the banks were unfairly punished over the past week, and even before that,\u201d said Matt Peron, the director of research at Janus Henderson, an asset manager. \u201cThe rally makes sense because they were oversold.\u201d",
      "Still, the gains weren\u2019t enough to reverse another bruising week for the nation\u2019s midsize banks. The seizure and sale of First Republic to JPMorgan Chase on Monday was presented by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, ushering in the end of the crisis that began in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.",
      "However, Mr. Dimon added that there \u201cmay be another smaller\u201d bank to run into trouble. Shortly thereafter, a fresh bout of pressure clobbered the stocks of smaller lenders like PacWest and Western Alliance, which tried to reassure investors that their deposit bases were stable and that the market moves were unrelated to their financial health.",
      "Even with Friday\u2019s bounce, PacWest remained set to end the week having lost nearly half its market value. Western Alliance ended roughly a quarter below where it started the week. The S&P 500 ended the week 0.8 percent lower.",
      "After trading ended on Friday, the Federal Reserve released data showing that deposits at commercial banks in the United States declined slightly in the week that ended April 26, falling to $17.17 trillion from $17.18 trillion in the week before. At domestically chartered banks, though, they ticked higher \u2014 to $15.96 trillion from $15.94 trillion previously. In either case, the data showed deposits had stabilized following much more sizable declines in March and early April.",
      "Concern over the fate of the regional lenders was further relieved by fresh data on Friday that showed a ",
      ", with the pace of new hiring in April coming in stronger than expected and workers still achieving ",
      ".",
      "Despite the strong numbers for April, downward revisions to data from earlier months show the longer-term trend of a slowing labor market persisted, and investors still expect Fed policymakers to pause on raising interest rates when they next meet in June.",
      "Elsewhere, oil prices rose, often a reflection of a brighter outlook for the global economy. They, too, bounced higher following a sharp decline earlier in the week.",
      "A further tailwind for the market came from ",
      ", which reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter, helping push its share price nearly 5 percent higher on Friday. Because of the size of the tech behemoth, its moves have more of an effect on the S&P 500 than any company in the index.",
      "Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said that it is possible to slow the economy enough to stem inflation without tipping it into recession. Arguably, Friday\u2019s employment data supports that notion of ",
      "Nonetheless, some investors remain on edge, even after Friday\u2019s bounce. The strong data nudged higher the possibility of a rate increase in June.",
      "The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changing interest-rate expectations, also rose, climbing 0.16 percentage points to 3.9 percent \u2014 a big move for an asset that typically changes by hundredths of a percentage point each day, and a sign that investors think interest rates could stay higher for longer.",
      "\u201cThe market seems vulnerable to a shock,\u201d said Mr. Peron. \u201cWe are going to be cautious until we get through a pause.\u201d",

      "A short list of moments in the day when Roger Lee is thinking about layoffs: while waiting for someone to show up to a Zoom call. After his two young children have gone to sleep. At 5 a.m., before his first meeting of the day.",
      "Since starting ",
      " as a side project at the start of the pandemic, he has cataloged nearly 450,000 tech layoffs in a public spreadsheet, updating the list whenever he can find a few minutes.",
      "Though Mr. Lee, 36, reads bad news constantly, he remains a stalwart optimist about tech. He recognizes the pain that layoffs cause, but he also believes the industry will \u201c100 percent\u201d bounce back.",
      "And Mr. Lee believes that talking openly about layoffs in the industry he loves is healthy. \u201cThe reduced stigma has the potential to be really positive,\u201d he said. If people are speaking openly about layoffs, he reasons, workers can find new jobs efficiently.",
      "Layoffs.fyi is both a symptom and a cause of a cultural shift toward transparency about layoffs in tech. Though Mr. Lee would never claim that his site is the only force driving this trend, he does think that it has helped workers put their own layoffs in context \u2014 and has helped the public understand the downturn. After tech companies fought to scoop up top talent during the pandemic, rapidly rising interest rates pushed companies to start ",
      " this year and last.",
      "\u201cHaving this website engenders more transparency,\u201d said Nick Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. As so many tech workers are laid off in Silicon Valley, he added, \u201cthe stigma has almost totally evaporated.\u201d",
      "Over the past three years, Mr. Lee\u2019s site has become a meaningful resource. Recruiters scour the listings for talent after big layoffs, and workers post their information when they lose their jobs.",
      "Tim Sackett, who runs an I.T. and engineering staffing firm, said that looking at Layoffs.fyi saves him \u201ca tremendous amount of time,\u201d because it points him to workers who are actively looking for jobs.",
      "Media organizations, including The New York Times, often cite Layoffs.fyi as a source for the latest tech layoff figures. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics shares data on layoffs in various sectors, it does not track them at venture-capital-backed start-ups and tech companies in real-time. So Mr. Lee helps fill the gap.",
      "\u201cIf you have fantastic government data on the state of tech,\u201d Mr. Bloom said, you don\u2019t need a site like Mr. Lee\u2019s. \u201cBut if that data does not exist, Layoffs.fyi becomes invaluable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was just a complete data vacuum,\u201d at the start of the pandemic, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive he was so early.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lee didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen. \u201cIt does feel weird,\u201d he said, \u201cto be the bearer of bad news.\u201d But he has kept going. He said his site gets at least a million views per month \u2014 and more than that in busy periods with a lot of layoffs.",
      "Mr. Lee had been following layoffs in an informal way since 2015, as he looked for talent to hire at his previous start-up. When the pandemic hit, he was on parental leave. He thought maybe others would find his process useful. \u201cMy original motivation was to be helpful,\u201d he said. At the time, he added, he was struck by the volume of layoffs occurring. \u201cI thought, wow, seven in one week, that\u2019s so many.\u201d",
      "Soon, the layoffs \u2014 and the demands of updating the tracker \u2014 accelerated. By April 2020, he said, \u201cI was spending all of my baby\u2019s nap times updating the site.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lee follows an informal set of self-imposed rules about what companies to post about, and when. He makes a judgment call about whether a company counts as \u201ctech\u201d\u2014 Buzzfeed: yes; Disney: no;\u2014 and sometimes sits on information until it has been reported in the news media.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a place where employees find out,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cI get these \u2018scoops\u2019 but don\u2019t try to break news.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t pretend these are hard and fast rules,\u201d he added. But, so far, he says they allow him to provide information that is useful to people without accidentally causing panic.",
      "Mr. Lee runs Layoffs.fyi as a hobby, and he spends money on it. In addition to his time, he estimates that he spends about $200 each month on the cost of its servers. He said he has declined to run ads, though he has been approached.",
      "But the site\u2019s popularity did help give him the idea for a new company: ",
      ", which tracks compensation in tech job postings, on a public list.",
      "He considers Comprehensive.io to be the inverse of Layoffs.fyi \u2014 it focuses on opportunities, not cuts. \u201cI likely wouldn\u2019t have come up with the latter without the former,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cPart of what gave him the intuition that people would find the pay transparency data interesting is how interesting people found the layoffs data,\u201d said Teddy Sherrill, Mr. Lee\u2019s longtime friend and a founder of Comprehensive.io, which now has a staff of about a dozen people.",
      "Though Mr. Lee is not yet 40, he takes a long view of tech. It helps that he has spent about half his life building websites.",
      "When advertisers first reached out to Mr. Lee asking if they could run ads on a site he built as an adolescent, he told them he didn\u2019t want to talk on the phone.",
      "\u201cI feared if I talked to them, they would realize I was a 13-year-old,\u201d he said.",
      "By 2002, Mr. Lee and his childhood friend ran some of the most popular sites for teens, according to Nielsen data published at the time.",
      "One of the companies he co-founded was SubProfile, a social media service built on AOL\u2019s instant messenger platform. By his junior year of high school, he said the site was generating \u201csix figures in revenue\u201d and getting at least seven million unique visitors per month. (Nothing he has done since has exceeded that traffic, he said.)",
      "He received his first paycheck from an advertiser at his parents\u2019 home in the suburbs of New York.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely a surreal experience,\u201d Mr. Lee said of his time as a teen entrepreneur. \u201cThat\u2019s when I first fell in love with the internet.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lee sold another company, a study guide site, while he was an undergraduate at Harvard. ",
      "After graduation, he co-founded an internet ad sales start-up called PaperG in New Haven, Conn. Mr. Lee was at the company, which has since changed its name to Thunder and was sold to Walmart, for about seven years.",
      "Krystal Benitez was hired onto Mr. Lee\u2019s operations team at PaperG in 2012. By that point the company, and Mr. Lee, had moved to San Francisco. Ms. Benitez said that Mr. Lee often gave informal financial advice to the staff, including several lunchtime lectures about investing and retirement planning. Personal finance is \u201ca very near and dear topic to his heart,\u201d she said. Indeed, Mr. Lee soon founded a 401(k) start-up called Human Interest, which was ",
      " in 2021.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s maybe no better way to have impact on people\u2019s financial lives than through employment and how they\u2019re paid,\u201d Mr. Lee said. He added that his interest in personal finance has animated his career, from Human Interest to Layoffs.fyi to his work now on Comprehensive.io.",
      "Mr. Lee\u2019s early enchantment \u2014 and early success \u2014 with the web continues to power his optimism about the industry, and his view that lives can be improved through technology.",
      "\u201cThe economy has gone through two boom-and-bust cycles that I\u2019ve been a part of,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth times, tech came back stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know it has its downsides,\u201d he said of the internet. But, he added, \u201cThe upsides are so, so positive.\u201d He believes that human traits, including our best impulses, are magnified online.",
      "\u201cYou might think the person behind Layoffs.fyi would be a cynical character,\u201d said Tyler Bosmeny, a college classmate of Mr. Lee\u2019s who was the first employee at PaperG and has since invested in his companies. But, he said, Mr. Lee is \u201cthe most optimistic person I know.\u201d He added that Mr. Lee often sees thorny issues as data problems that can be solved with tech.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s most hysterical,\u201d Mr. Bosmeny added, is that \u201cthis was his idea of taking a break.\u201d"

      "On Friday, Mr. DeSantis signed a bill into law giving a board that oversees government services at Disney World the ability to void development agreements that had already been approved for the resort.",
      "At least for now, the new law is a relatively minor development in the ongoing conflict between Mr. DeSantis and Disney over the potential expansion of the company\u2019s 25,000-acre theme park resort near Orlando. That is because Disney and the board have already sued each other over the development agreements; the matter is essentially on hold, awaiting to be addressed by the judicial system.",
      "Disney declined to comment on Friday.",
      "The development agreements were approved by a previous, Disney-controlled iteration of the board. The current board, made up of members appointed by Mr. DeSantis this year, contends that the agreements are illegal, and voted to nullify them.",

      " in state court as part of its effort to void the agreements.",
      "The Florida Legislature passed the bill on Thursday. It did not originally involve Disney. As introduced in early March, the bill\u2019s purpose was to update requirements for comprehensive land use planning by municipalities. At the urging of Mr. DeSantis, the part applicable to Disney was added last month. Democrats opposed the amendment, saying that it set a dangerous precedent for state interference with individual company contracts.",
      "\u201cBeyond the Disney drama, let\u2019s just talk about the notion of canceling a contract that you don\u2019t like,\u201d Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state representative from the Orlando area, said during the debate.",

      "A cluster of regional banks scrambled on Thursday to convince the public of their financial soundness, even as their stock prices plunged and investors took bets on which might be the next to fall.",
      "The tumult brought questions about the future of the lenders to the fore, suggesting a new phase in the crisis that began two months ago with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and was punctuated on Monday by the seizure and sale of First Republic Bank.",
      "PacWest and Western Alliance were in the eye of the storm, despite the companies\u2019 protestations that their finances were solid. PacWest\u2019s shares lost 50 percent of their value on Thursday and Western Alliance fell 38 percent. Other midsize banks, including Zions and Comerica, also posted double-digit percentage declines.",
      "On Friday, there were early signs of a potential rebound, as shares of PacWest and Western Alliance both rose about 12 percent in premarket trading.",

      " and don\u2019t sit on mountains of soured loans. They are also much smaller than Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic, which each had about $200 billion in assets when they collapsed. PacWest, based in Los Angeles, has about $40 billion in assets, and Western Alliance, with headquarters in Phoenix, has $65 billion in assets. Both banks run fewer than 100 branches.",
      "The most immediate threat the banks face, analysts said, is a crisis of confidence. Headlines about their spiraling share prices could spook depositors and upend the banks\u2019 ability to operate normally.",
      "\u201cHow do we get out of this?\u201d said Christopher McGratty, head of U.S. bank research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \u201cI think we\u2019re still searching for that answer.\u201d",
      "Shares of PacWest and Western Alliance were halted for trading dozens of times on Thursday as their huge price swings breached stock-exchange guardrails put in place to prevent a sell-off from spiraling out of control. The turmoil also raised the specter of concerted action by short sellers, the traders who bet on share prices falling and are sometimes blamed for stoking market volatility.",
      "The Biden administration was closely monitoring the markets, \u201cincluding the short-selling pressures on healthy banks,\u201d the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters on Thursday. Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a statement about market conditions that the agency was \u201cfocused on identifying and prosecuting any form of misconduct that might threaten investors, capital formation or the markets more broadly.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere was extreme anxiety about these banks without a lot of reasoning,\u201d he said.",

      " that conditions had calmed since Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s collapse, noting that it and the two other failed banks \u201cat the heart of the stress\u201d had been resolved. Hours later, PacWest\u2019s shares began their latest nosedive.",
      "It has since become clear that investors are not convinced that the regional lenders left standing can remain viable. And though there is no reason for any company to be immediately toppled by falling share prices, the outlook remains uncertain, with investors still bruised from March\u2019s initial round of turbulence.",
      "\u201cInstitutional investors have lost confidence in banks,\u201d said Julian Wellesley, a bank analyst at Loomis Sayles. \u201cI hear from a lot of people that the share prices don\u2019t make sense but still no one wants to come in and buy.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s disconcerting for the banks themselves, indicating that their claims of sound financial health have yet to achieve the desired impact.",
      "There is a limit to how long any public company can limp along with a cratering stock price before creating fear among depositors and drawing ire from shareholders.",
      "Even before this week\u2019s commotion, depositors were increasingly worried about the safety of their money, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. According to a ",
      " poll conducted through late April, 48 percent of U.S. adults said they were concerned about the money they held in deposits at financial institutions.",
      "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which guarantees bank accounts up to $250,000, this week released a report saying it would ",
      ". The agency suggested that it might try to provide higher levels of insurance to business payment accounts, which would allow businesses to feel comfortable continuing to pay workers without creating the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d problems that could happen if all deposits were broadly guaranteed.",
      "It would require legislation from Congress to amend the current deposit insurance system.",
      "Amid the relentless stock declines, some blamed a different boogeyman: Investors who bet on a fall in the price of a stock. Short sellers have made nearly $7 billion this year betting against regional banks, according to estimates by S3 Partners, a data provider, and can direct those profits toward new targets.",
      "PacWest appeared most squarely in their cross hairs, for the moment at least. Almost 20 percent of the bank\u2019s shares are currently on loan to short sellers, who sell them and hope to buy them back later when the stock has fallen, according to data from S3. Nearly 8 percent of Western Alliance\u2019s shares are similarly lent out.",
      "Before First Republic was seized, over 36 percent of its shares were out on loan.",
      "On Thursday, Western Alliance blamed those short sellers for the turmoil, suggesting they were behind \u201cfalse narratives about a financially sound and profitable bank,\u201d as it issued a statement denying a report that it was considering a sale.",
      "Such attacks rarely work against short sellers, and the banks\u2019 disclosures, on Wednesday and Thursday, detailing that their depositors weren\u2019t fleeing and that their capital base was sound, didn\u2019t seem to either.",
      "One solution mooted to put an end to such attacks would be to ban short selling, ",
      ". It\u2019s not clear whether such bans worked as intended and when asked about it on Thursday, a Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman said the agency was not contemplating any limits on short selling of regional bank stocks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure just yet that Washington is going to do anything,\u201d said Ian Katz, a policy analyst at advisory Capital Alpha Partners. He underlined the worry: \u201cWhat is going to stop this at this point?\u201d",
      "In a display of confidence, executives at Zions, a Utah-based lender with about $90 billion in assets, spent nearly $2 million in the past several days investing in the bank\u2019s falling stock, according to regulatory filings.",
      "The lenders now under pressure also appear eager to open their books to try to reassure investors. First Republic mostly stayed quiet as its business collapsed.",
      "PacWest released a statement overnight on Thursday saying that it had \u201cbeen approached by several potential partners and investors.\u201d Hours earlier, a report that it was exploring its options triggered a 50 percent slump in its share price in after-hours trading on Wednesday.",
      "The bank said it had not seen \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d deposit outflows since First Republic\u2019s collapse, saying that deposits stood at $28 billion as of Tuesday, down slightly from late April.",
      "Western Alliance also released updated financial details on Wednesday and noted it \u201chas not experienced unusual deposit flows\u201d in recent days. It said deposits had increased by $1.2 billion since the end of March.",
      "Western Alliance\u2019s shares still whipsawed, particularly after The Financial Times reported that the bank had hired advisers to guide it on a potential sale \u2014 an indication that the lender was in need of help. The shares recovered from their worst losses after Western Alliance denied the report, but still ended the day significantly lower.",
      "\u201cThe stock is not the company, and the company is not the stock,\u201d said Timothy Coffey, a bank analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. \u201cBut the loss of confidence in a financial institution can be hard to repair.\u201d",

      "Katie Cotton, who as Apple\u2019s longtime communications chief guarded the media\u2019s access to Steve Jobs, the company\u2019s visionary co-founder, and helped organize the introduction of many of his products, died on April 6 in Redwood City, Calif. She was 57.",
      "Her death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Michael Mimeles, her former husband. He did not give a cause but said that she had experienced complications from heart surgery she underwent a few years ago.",
      "Ms. Cotton, who built a culture of mystery by saying relatively little, if anything, to reporters, joined Apple in 1996 and began working with Mr. Jobs the next year, soon after he returned to the company after 12 years away. Apple was in poor financial shape at the time, but Ms. Cotton worked with him to engineer a striking turnaround.",
      "Together they crafted a tightly controlled public relations strategy as the company recovered from steep losses and turned out one successful product after another, including the iMac desktop computer and innovative digital devices like the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad.",
      "\u201cShe was formidable and tough and very protective of both Apple\u2019s brand and Steve, particularly when he got sick,\u201d ",
      ", a former technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal, said in a phone interview, referring to Mr. Jobs\u2019s diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 2004. He added: \u201cShe was one of the few people he trusted implicitly. He listened to her. She could pull him back from something he intended to do or say.\u201d ",

      "Ms. Cotton spoke tersely, if at all, when reporters questioned her, but she could be helpful when speaking off the record or on background.",
      "\u201cShe was accessible, she was a point of contact,\u201d said John Markoff, a former technology reporter for The New York Times, \u201cbut sometimes it was hand-to-hand combat if they wanted to convey a story to the world and it wasn\u2019t the story I wanted to tell.\u201d",
      "Ms. Cotton also chose which reporters could speak to Mr. Jobs (even though he would occasionally speak, on his own, to journalists he knew well). In 1997, she invited a Newsweek reporter, Katie Hafner, to watch, along with Mr. Jobs, the first commercial in Apple\u2019s new ",
      " advertising campaign.",
      "A tribute to \u201cthe crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels and the troublemakers,\u201d a narrator intoned as the commercial opened with a still picture of Mr. Jobs holding an apple in his left hand; it continued with clips of people who changed the world, among them Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, John Lennon, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Thomas Edison and Muhammad Ali.",
      "\u201cI looked over and Steve was crying,\u201d ",

      "Kathryn Elizabeth Cotton was born on Oct. 30, 1965, in Washington, N.J. Her father, Philip, worked for a telecommunications company. Her mother, Marie (Cuvo) Cotton, held various jobs, including caterer.",
      "After graduating from the University of Arizona in 1988 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism, Ms. Cotton worked at Dav-El Limousine in Los Angeles in sales, marketing and public relations before moving to the public relations agency Allison Thomas Associates. The company\u2019s technology clients included Mr. Jobs, who was then running the technology company NeXT. But Ms. Thomas and Mr. Jobs had a falling-out before Ms. Cotton was hired in about 1994.",
      "\u201cShe was great at what she did,\u201d Ms. Thomas said in a phone interview, \u201cbut it took a while for her obsessive work habits to become clear.\u201d",
      "In mid-1996, when Gilbert Amelio was Apple\u2019s chief executive, the struggling company hired Ms. Cotton to help with its public relations. \u201cKatie did tech P.R. before it was hip and cool to do, and Apple needed someone with her experience,\u201d said Mr. Mimeles, her ex-husband, who also worked at Apple.",

That same year he elevated Ms. Cotton to run Apple\u2019s public relations and communications. He eventually named her vice president of worldwide communications, a title she held for many years.",
      "\u201cWhen Steve came back, he didn\u2019t just put key engineers in place,\u201d Greg Joswiak, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of marketing, said. \u201cHe put the right people in place to lead us around the company, and Katie was a big part of that.\u201d",
      "She continued to work for Mr. Jobs until his death, all the while saying little publicly about his health problems. She then worked for Tim Cook, his successor, until she retired in 2014.",
      "One measure of her influence was a headline in Macworld magazine: ",
      " What it could mean for the press.\u201d",

    "name": "Tucker Carlson Wants to Return to TV Before 2025. Will Fox Let Him?",

      "Tucker Carlson is making it clear to people close to him that he would like to be back on the air somewhere soon. But he first needs Fox News to agree to a deal that would allow him to work elsewhere, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions, leaving it unclear whether he will be able to start a new chapter in his media career before his current contract expires in January 2025.",
      "Since Mr. Carlson was taken off the air by Fox News last week, his lawyers have been in touch with Fox to negotiate an agreement to set the terms of his departure. And he has been the subject of unofficial courting by right-wing media outlets who\u2019ve let it be known they would hire him if they could.",
      "But a swirl of embarrassing disclosures about the prime time host\u2019s private remarks have cast a shadow over those discussions.",
      "Some of Mr. Carlson\u2019s allies have accused the network of being behind the disclosures. Fox insists that it doesn\u2019t like the leaks any more than Mr. Carlson does and is considering taking legal action to stop them.",
      "On early Friday, lawyers for Fox sent a cease-and-desist letter to Media Matters for America, a longtime Fox critic that recently published leaked, behind-the-scenes video from Mr. Carlson\u2019s set. That footage has shown Mr. Carlson making sexist and boorish statements and fuming with hatred toward the lawyer who questioned him in a 10-hour deposition that was part of the billion-dollar defamation suit filed against Fox by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "In its letter, Fox lawyers said that the videos had been \u201cunlawfully obtained.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat unaired footage is Fox\u2019s confidential intellectual property,\u201d the letter said. \u201cFox did not consent to its distribution or publication; and Fox does not consent to its further distribution or publication.\u201d",
      "Those leaks, and a ",
      " that a previously undisclosed text from Mr. Carlson expressing racist views caused high-level alarm inside the company ahead of the Dominion trial \u2014 where it threatened to inflame a jury \u2014 have complicated the efforts of both Fox and Mr. Carlson to put this messy episode behind them.",
      "So far, Mr. Carlson has said nothing publicly since last week, except for a short video statement he posted on Twitter. Through a representative, he declined to comment for this article.",
      "But some of his allies in conservative media have \u2014 without offering proof \u2014 blamed Fox for trying to tarnish the reputation of its former star host, saying the network is looking to hamstring his career prospects.",
      "\u201cFox News teaming up with Media Matters to smear Tucker Carlson is one of the slimiest betrayals I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Matt Walsh, a podcaster for the conservative Daily Wire, ",
      " this week.",
      "Others found the accusations a bit of a stretch. \u201cThe idea that Fox is (somehow) colluding with its mortal enemy,\u201d ",
      " Mike Davis, a conservative legal strategist, \u201cto trash Tucker is truly a tin-foil hat, utterly stupid conspiracy theory.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Fox said the network had no further comment beyond its statement last week announcing that the network and Mr. Carlson had parted ways. ",
      "Getting back to work before his contract expires is not a certainty for Mr. Carlson. Like many other television hosts, he has a contract that contains language \u2014 known in the media industry as \u201cpay or play\u201d \u2014 that allows networks to keep their biggest stars from working for their rivals as long as they are under contract, according to a person with knowledge of his deal.",
      "Anchors like Mr. Carlson usually also have terms in their contracts that prevent them from making unsanctioned media appearances, said Andy Lee, an entertainment lawyer with Foley & Lardner, which is not involved in the negotiations. If Mr. Carlson\u2019s contract has those provisions, they could hamper any efforts he might make to play a role as a commentator in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "\u201cThere are circumstances where pay-or-play provisions can be challenged, but networks and studios certainly view them as being relatively ironclad,\u201d Mr. Lee said.",
      "It is possible that Fox would continue to pay out Mr. Carlson\u2019s contract in full to keep him away as a competitor. Or Mr. Carlson and Fox News could work out a separation agreement that allowed the former Fox host to get back on the air before his contract expires. That could require him to forfeit millions of dollars he is owed by the network.",
      "Yet it may be in the interests of both parties to resolve the situation amicably. Mr. Carlson would be able to build a business outside Fox. And Fox would be spared the threat of what a disgruntled Mr. Carlson might do to drive a wedge between his loyal followers and Fox News. Already, the ratings for Mr. Carlson\u2019s old 8 p.m. time slot have dropped significantly. And some of his fans have raised the possibility of a boycott of the network.",
      "Mr. Carlson has turned to the lawyer Bryan Freedman to help negotiate a settlement. Mr. Freedman has handled departure deals for numerous TV stars and is well known for his aggressive negotiation tactics.",
      "An agreement that allows Mr. Carlson to appear on a rival news network like Newsmax would be a considerable concession from Fox. In any agreement, Fox would most likely insist on prohibiting Mr. Carlson from joining a cable news competitor, said a person familiar with how negotiations with big Fox stars have unfolded in the past.",
      "Any number of opportunities are available to Mr. Carlson if he and Fox News agree to terms releasing him from his contract early. Some former Fox News hosts, such as Megyn Kelly, have taken an entrepreneurial path, starting their own companies to produce radio shows and podcasts. Others, like the former \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d host Bill O\u2019Reilly, have appeared on smaller networks like The First TV, an upstart founded by Red Seat Ventures.",
      "News of Mr. Carlson\u2019s breakup with Fox immediately stoked speculation in right-wing media circles about his next steps. Mr. Carlson\u2019s nightly perch on Fox News has made him a power broker and an opinion-shaper in the Republican Party. That would make him a serious get for the conservative media companies that have pitched themselves as alternatives to the mainstream press \u2014 and to Fox News, the right-wing media behemoth.",
      "One associate of Mr. Carlson\u2019s said that Rumble, a right-wing media company based in Canada, would be a likely suitor. The Daily Wire, a media start-up co-founded by the conservative commenter Ben Shapiro, is interested in exploring a deal with Mr. Carlson, as are the conservative TV networks Newsmax and One America News, according to three people familiar with their interest.",
      "Fox News, for its part, is rotating hosts in Mr. Carlson\u2019s old time-slot under the \u201cFox News Tonight\u201d banner for the foreseeable future. So far, hosts have included Brian Kilmeade, who usually co-hosts the network\u2019s popular \u201cFox and Friends\u201d morning show, and Lawrence Jones, another host at the network.",
      "Fox News, the longtime king of cable news ratings, has suffered an audience dip in Mr. Carlson\u2019s hour after his abrupt departure. Fox\u2019s audience in that time slot on some nights fell behind both CNN\u2019s and MSNBC\u2019s over the last week among adults ages 25-54, a rare loss in that demographic, which is coveted by advertisers.",
      "For Mr. Carlson, there\u2019s more at stake than a paycheck, Mr. Lee said. Many TV personalities become less relevant the longer they stay off the air, hurting their earning potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always just a question of money, because being off the air for an extended period can have an adverse effect on a career,\u201d Mr. Lee said.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last year, with pandemic lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Whole Foods Market made a bet on a gritty San Francisco neighborhood. The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.",
      "But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of\u00a0568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.",
      "\u201cMale w/machete is back,\u201d the report on one 911 call states. \u201cAnother security guard was just assaulted,\u201d another says. A man with a four-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.",
      "In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.",
      "When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city\u2019s most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.",
      "The closure also seemed to be the latest indicator of San Francisco\u2019s faltering economic prospects, providing more grist for an ongoing debate over ",
      " after tying its fate to the tech industry. The Whole Foods was supposed to cater to tech workers and other professionals, part of a long-term redevelopment plan downtown. But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city's center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.",
      "In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco\u2019s continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco\u2019s downtown remains at roughly a third of prepandemic levels \u2014 lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to ",
      " that used cellphone data as a measure.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a very slow recovery,\u201d Effi Shoua said this month from behind his desk at the downtown fine art gallery he owns in Union Square. The area is a prime spot for tourists, who have been steadily returning to the city, a bright spot and a contrast to the 26 percent vacancy rate of downtown offices.",
      "Many merchants are worried about a domino effect of commercial failures if office workers are permanently absent for about half of the week, while people using drugs, going through mental crises or living on the street\u00a0remain more visible than ever.",
      "The impact on the city\u2019s budget is significant, too: Office-based industries account for nearly three quarters of the city\u2019s gross domestic product. After years of surpluses, the government now forecasts a $780 million deficit in the upcoming two fiscal years \u2014 roughly a 6 percent cut in its general fund, according to the mayor\u2019s office.",
      "City officials say they are searching for ways to diversify the economy and to reduce homelessness and drug dealing. They realize that some of the largest local employers, Big Tech companies, will not be towing San Francisco from its economic shoals. Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.",
      "San Francisco leaders point out that the city has rebounded again and again, including after the near-collapse of the tech industry in 2000 and the national recession about eight years later.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been counted out before, and there have been others who have tried to imply because things aren\u2019t happening as fast or the way that they think it should happen, that it\u2019s over,\u201d London Breed, the city\u2019s mayor, said in an interview.",
      "In the famously liberal city, where Republicans make up just 7 percent of the electorate, moderate Democrats like Mayor Breed are calling for aggressive steps to address public safety concerns while progressive voices decry law-and-order strategies as kneejerk responses that trample on the vulnerable.",
      "City leaders face some limitations. A federal judge in April determined that San Francisco ",
      " from public spaces because it has not done enough to provide shelter. Mayor Breed is backing bills in the State Legislature that would make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment. The mayor has also proposed addressing homelessness by building more: slashing the permitting process for construction with the goal of building 83,000 additional homes and apartments \u2014 a 20 percent increase from the city\u2019s current total housing stock \u2014 in eight years.",
      "Even though the downtown is plastered with \u201cfor lease\u201d signs, the city\u2019s ",
      " is under 3 percent and the mayor and other officials say the engineering talent pool remains the city\u2019s top asset. And there is much more to San Francisco than its downtown. It has always been a constellation\u00a0of very different neighborhoods, some of which have very few of the social ills that afflict the area near the closed Whole Foods.",
      "Officials add that\u00a0the downtown may ultimately emerge more resilient if it attracts industries like life sciences and bio-tech whose employees still need work space. There is growth in the tech industry, too: The development of artificial intelligence, which promises to transform the way that people live and work, is ",

      "Mr. Tan is part of a generation of tech workers who are more assertive in their demands on city officials, unafraid to take sides in the city\u2019s internecine politics and funding organizations that press for more emphasis on public safety.",
      "\u201cNow the narrative out there for some of the founders in our community is, I\u2019m not sure if I feel safe here. I\u2019m not sure if I want to stay here. The quality of life issues are the question. Can I raise a family here?\u201d",

      "Still, Bill Scott, the city\u2019s police chief, says many residents complain that they feel less safe, and the open-air drug use, much of it tied to fentanyl, is a major contributor.",
      "Matt Dorsey, a member of the board of supervisors who lives steps away from the shuttered Whole Foods, said recent elections had signaled a shift in voter priorities. He pointed to last year\u2019s recall of the city\u2019s progressive district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was replaced by a prosecutor who vowed to be tougher on crime.",
      "\u201cSan Francisco is in the midst of a voter revolt on public safety,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. In ",
      " in September, nearly two-thirds of respondents said life in the city was worse off than when they moved here.",
      "The new district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, has begun prosecuting more drug crimes than Mr. Boudin, but the city experienced a 40 percent jump in fatal overdoses in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.",
      "Citing\u00a0that statistic, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday authorized an antidrug task force in San Francisco that will include members of the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol.",
      "The mayor and the police chief have vowed to hire hundreds of additional officers, which would expand the force by more than one-fourth, a difficult proposition when law enforcement agencies nationwide are facing shortages.",
      "Not everyone is on board with that.",
      "Dean Preston, a member of the board of supervisors who was re-elected in 2020 on a Democratic Socialist platform, is against increasing police staffing and believes the idea of a shift in the electorate\u2019s view about public safety is overstated.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a massive propaganda effort to change public opinion around policing and public safety,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Preston uses his district as an example of how uneven the pandemic recovery has been. Some areas like Japantown and Haight Ashbury are thriving, he said. Others like the Tenderloin, which is adjacent to the shuttered Whole Foods, are beset by drug dealing and homelessness.",
      "One of the next big tests for downtown might be this summer\u2019s expected opening of an Ikea store not far from the Whole Foods site.",
      "Police described theft as rampant at Whole Foods, with thieves walking out\u00a0with armfuls of alcohol, at least at the start. After 250 shopping hand baskets were stolen, the company restocked with 50 more. Those went missing, too.",
      "During the store\u2019s 13 months in operation, at least 14 people were arrested, including on charges of grand theft and battery, according to official reports. Chief Scott said that\u00a0plainclothes officers were sent there and security improved over time, but seemingly not enough for the company.",
      "On a recent chilly night across from the shuttered store, Joseph Peterson, a former construction worker who lost both of his legs to diabetes and is homeless, rolled down the sidewalk in his wheelchair. Mr. Peterson could see the 2,000-unit Trinity apartments, the high-end complex that Whole Foods had hoped would be its customer base. Across the intersection, security guards stood sentry in front of the Orpheum Theater, where \u201cPretty Woman: The Musical\u201d was playing. A few dozen steps away, dealers peddled fentanyl and crystal meth.",

      "Is this finally the beginning of the end of the pandemic, or just another spring ebb before a new variant initiates a summer wave? (For the past two years, numbers have fallen between March and June, before rising in July.) The New York Times spoke with epidemiologists and infectious disease experts to gauge how they\u2019re thinking about this particular juncture in the pandemic \u2014 what the risk is right now, what precautions they\u2019re continuing to take, who is still getting severely ill and dying, and what the future may bring.",
      "Experts agree that the risk from Covid-19 right now is low, and spring 2023 feels different from previous years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a stage of stability where people are making choices to return their lives to something closer to normal,\u201d said Dr. Robert Wachter, the chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cAnd I think that makes sense. Cases are relatively low; deaths are relatively low.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason for this improvement is that virtually everyone in the United States has some form of immunity now, whether from vaccines, a previous infection or both. Medications like ",
      " have also significantly reduced the risk of serious illness.",
      "Dr. Taison Bell, an infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia, said that in his intensive care unit, \u201cwe will see an occasional Covid-19 case, but we\u2019re not seeing a lot of cases that are leading to people being on the ventilator.\u201d Now, most of the people Dr. Bell is treating for Covid are older and either have pre-existing conditions that compromise their immune systems or lung function, or they haven\u2019t been vaccinated. It\u2019s essential, he said, that people who are at high risk for severe infection get a ",
      " if they haven\u2019t already (a second dose was also ",
      " for this group).",
      "Another reason things are different this spring is that there have been no new, game-changing variants \u2014 \u201cno new Greek letters,\u201d as Dr. Wachter put it \u2014 for the last year and a half. Variations of Omicron that have some immune-evading properties, such as the current dominant strain, ",
      ", have emerged, but Paxlovid and vaccines are still effective against them.",
      "Despite the good news, experts are still taking some precautions. Because while the numbers are headed in the right direction, roughly 100,000 Americans are still being infected with Covid-19 every week, and more than 150 are dying from the infection every day.",
      "Dr. Wachter continues to wear a mask in most crowded indoor settings, like on an airplane or in a museum, he said, but not if he needs to pop into a store quickly.",
      "His main motivation is wanting to avoid ",
      ". \u201cUnlike the way I felt two or three years ago, I have no fear that I\u2019m going to die of this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think long Covid is very real. My wife has a mild version of it, so I see it up close and personal.\u201d",
      "Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has young children, said that she stopped wearing a mask at the grocery store or in the office, though she still dons one on public transportation. She said that the disruptions Covid and other respiratory infections caused this winter, like missing school and work, were worth avoiding.",
      "The experts especially urged people to keep taking precautions, such as masking and testing before big indoor gatherings, if they or a loved one are at high risk.",
      "\u201cI think we have to do what we can to mitigate risk, not just for ourselves, but also we live in a community,\u201d said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician who still tests herself before going to events. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the person next to me is immunocompromised, and I don\u2019t want to give them Covid.\u201d",
      "The experts cautioned that it\u2019s always possible for a new variant to emerge and start another wave.",
      "Dr. Kuppalli said that she was watching Omicron subvariant XBB.1.16, also known as Arcturus, which is driving a surge in India. XBB.1.16 ",
      " for about 12 percent of cases in the United States and comes with a new symptom: conjunctivitis.",
      "Dr. Rivers is paying attention to another new subvariant, XBB.1.9.1, which makes up 9 percent of U.S. infections right now. She expects cases to start rising again as the weather warms, driven by either these variants or one like them. \u201cWe generally see a quiet spring followed by a summer resurgence that starts in the South\u201d because people are more likely to gather indoors when it gets too hot, she said.",
      "And this, experts say, is likely our new normal. \u201cThe stage where we are now is probably a version of a stage we\u2019ll be in a year from now, maybe two years from now, maybe five years from now,\u201d Dr. Wachter said. \u201cIt could get a little worse, in which case I think people and societies change if they\u2019re being rational. I think it\u2019s unlikely to get much better.\u201d"

      "That mysterious twinge on one side of your lower abdomen that isn\u2019t occurring alongside your period? The one that keeps coming back, every month and roughly in the middle of your menstrual cycle? That sensation is most likely pain associated with ovulation, or, as it\u2019s known in the medical world, mittelschmerz (the German term for \u201cmiddle pain\u201d).",
      "It\u2019s difficult to pin down just how prevalent ovulation pain is because, in most cases, it\u2019s so mild that women don\u2019t report it, said Dr. Jenna Turocy, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University. Some estimates suggest as many as ",
      " of women of reproductive age feel it almost every month. It can also be difficult to identify; the sensation might linger for a few minutes or it could last for hours. It sometimes feels like mild cramping or, for others, it\u2019s so painful that it gets confused with ",
      ".",
      "There is very little research on mittelschmerz, with only a handful of published papers on the topic, many of which either date back to the early 1900s or are small and focused on rare medical complications, said Dr. Daniel Breitkopf, a gynecologist at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot on the why,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd very little of the research has to do with the day-to-day experience.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear, for example, why some women don\u2019t experience pain with ovulation at all.",
      "Ovulation is a fairly complex process, said Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg, vice president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School. It involves one follicle (a fluid-filled sac in the ovary that carries a single egg) growing drastically in size, from less than ",
      ", in a matter of days. When the follicle has matured, the egg pushes out through its surface. \u201cEvery ovulation is essentially a ruptured cyst,\u201d Dr. Ginsburg said. ",
      " have shown that ovulation coincides with a small explosion of fluid and sometimes blood on the surface of the ovary, Dr. Ginsburg said. Because ovulation takes place in either one of the two ovaries, those who feel the pain will notice that it occurs on alternating sides from one cycle to the next.",
      "\u201cMy patients mostly have infertility and are trying to get pregnant, so they\u2019re kind of reassured when they feel this pain,\u201d which is often an indication of their highest chance in a cycle to become pregnant, Dr. Ginsburg said.",
      "It\u2019s not clear which exact part of the ovulation process might cause pain. One ",
      ", which measured hormone levels and follicle size, found that women reported pain before the egg had emerged, suggesting that the pain might be a \u201cpre-ovulatory event.\u201d One explanation is that the expansion of the follicle can lead to some cramping, Dr. Ginsburg said.",
      "There are two other potential culprits, said Dr. Aparna Sridhar, an OB-GYN at U.C.L.A. Health: luteinizing hormone, called LH, which triggers follicle rupture, and ",
      ", which are hormone-like substances that spur muscle contractions (and thus, sometimes pain), including in surrounding muscles like the bowels. The surge in LH invites a surge in prostaglandins, she said.",
      "Teenagers who have just started menstruating, for example, tend not to feel ovulatory pain, Dr. Sridhar said. That\u2019s most likely because, though their follicles expand, they don\u2019t ovulate at that point in their lives and therefore don\u2019t have high levels of LH or prostaglandins.",
      "Ovulation pain should not be debilitating, and severe pain that hasn\u2019t subsided after 24 hours is a sign of a larger problem, Dr. Breitkopf said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that when people come in for this, it\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s pretty bad and it\u2019s affecting their life,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s bad enough that they may have to take time off work.\u201d",
      "In some cases, for example, the pain might be indicative of ",
      " from the ruptured follicle, which might require surgery. Women with endometriosis or those who have had previous surgery that scarred their ovaries tend to feel more acute pain around ovulation.",
      "Experts say that the medicine and treatment that help with period cramps should also help manage most cases of mild ovulation pain, like over-the-counter pain medications. \u201cA heat pack can be helpful too,\u201d Dr. Turocy said.",
      "For those who aren\u2019t trying to get pregnant and for whom the pain gets in the way of day-to-day activities, hormonal birth control is another option because it tends to stop ovulation altogether, Dr. Sridhar said. \u201cThat can make life easier.\u201d"

      "Menopause costs American women an estimated $1.8 billion in lost working time per year, according to ",
      " published this week. The paper examined how hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and the myriad other symptoms associated with this time of life affect women in the workplace. It\u2019s the largest study of its kind to have been done in the United States.",
      "Researchers surveyed more than 4,000 participants at four Mayo Clinic sites in Minnesota, Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin. Roughly 15 percent said they had either missed work or cut back on hours because of their menopause symptoms, which the study classified as \u201cadverse work outcomes.\u201d Those who reported the very worst symptoms were 16 times more likely to report such outcomes than those with the least severe symptoms. A little over 1 percent said that their symptoms had become so debilitating that they either quit their jobs or were laid off in the preceding six months.",
      "\u201cWe took that data and extrapolated it based on the work force in the U.S., and that\u2019s how we arrived at the estimated annual loss,\u201d said Dr. Juliana Kling, a co-author of the study and chair of the Women\u2019s Health Internal Medicine division at Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. There are, according to U.S. census data, more than 15 million women ages 45 to 60 in the workplace.",
      "Though a majority of survey participants were white, the researchers found that menopause can have a greater effect on Black and Hispanic working women, Dr. Kling said. \u201cBlack women tended to have more menopausal symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd higher percentages of Black women and Hispanic women reported adverse work outcomes related to menopausal symptoms compared to white women.\u201d",
      "Several other ",
      " have arrived at conclusions similar to those of the Mayo Clinic study. A smaller survey by the corporate health benefits provider ",
      " found that roughly 20 percent of women took time off from work because of menopause. Researchers at ",
      " in England analyzed data from a longitudinal study of over 3,000 women and found that those who reported at least one disruptive menopausal symptom at the age of 50 were 43 percent more likely to have left their jobs by the age of 55.",
      "The findings underscore the physical, economic and social challenges women face as they age, enduring sometimes debilitating physical changes while navigating the discomfort of discussing menopause with younger or male colleagues, said Dr. Ekta Kapoor, a co-author of the study and an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. \u201cThe topic of menopause is taboo in general but even more so at the workplace,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from women that they don\u2019t want to come across as a \u2018complainer\u2019 at work or they\u2019ll bring up menopause and people will roll their eyes.\u201d This, Dr. Kapoor added, can exacerbate the psychological challenges.",
      "The economic loss calculated by the Mayo Clinic study is likely an underestimate, Dr. Kapoor said, because the women surveyed have access to health insurance and potential treatments for their symptoms, which is not the case for many Americans.",
      "The findings \u201caffirm what patients tell me,\u201d said Dr. Makeba Williams, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. (Dr. Williams was not involved with the research.) One of her patients, for example, is a university professor who was so troubled by the brain fog she had during the transition to menopause that she decided to stop teaching advanced level courses, Dr. Williams said. \u201cHer symptoms had gotten so bad, she could not find the next word when lecturing. That story can come in many different versions. Women see in their day-to-day lives that their productivity is impacted.\u201d",
      "But most Americans don\u2019t have the ability to choose to cut back on work the way some women in the study did, Dr. Williams said. \u201cMany women don\u2019t have the privilege of saying I\u2019m just not going to teach this course \u2014 because maybe if you don\u2019t show up, you will not have a job, and that has economic and personal financial impact too.\u201d",

      "The drug manufacturer Eli Lilly announced on Wednesday that a clinical trial of an experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug showed it can slow progress of the feared disease and allow patients to have more time when they can still live independently, performing tasks like cooking meals, going to the store and driving a car.",
      "Lilly announced its results, from a trial involving 1,736 patients, in a ",
      ", as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A peer-reviewed paper will follow.",
      "The drug, donanemab, is not a cure, but along with two other drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it may be a turning point in the long and frustrating quest to find an Alzheimer\u2019s treatment. ",
      "\u201cThese all point in the same direction,\u201d said Dr. Ronald Petersen, the director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic. He added that the donanemab results were \u201cmodest\u201d but \u201cmeaningful.\u201d ",
      "Dr. Petersen has done paid consulting work for pharmaceutical companies, including Lilly. He was not involved in the design or execution of any of the recent trials.",
      "Dr. Samuel Gandy, a professor of Alzheimer\u2019s disease research at Mount Sinai, was more subdued.",
      "\u201cFamilies and researchers are stuck with what we know now, which is that two drugs have a statistically meaningful but only modest clinical benefit,\u201d he said, echoing Dr. Petersen\u2019s assessment. He has consulted and received research support from pharmaceutical companies but was not involved in the Lilly trial.",
      "Dr. Petersen said that patients and their families must be counseled about a dire side effect of donanemab \u2014 a risk of brain swelling that can result in death. Three patients in the Lilly trial died.",
      "A similar percentage of deaths from the same side effect followed in the clinical trial of Leqembi, an ",

      "The results come after decades of failed attempts, despair, discouragement and billions of dollars spent. Most big pharmaceutical companies simply gave up on Alzheimer\u2019s drugs.",
      "After those failures, some researchers decided that a leading hypothesis about the disease \u2014 that it is driven by hard, Brillo-like plaques in the brain made of amyloid protein \u2014 was incorrect. But the successes of the new drugs, which attack amyloid, bolster the hypothesis.",
      "Taking the drugs is not like taking an antibiotic and seeing a fever go away. To measure the new drug\u2019s effectiveness, the Lilly researchers instead looked at how likely patients were to progress through the categories of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, going from mild cognitive impairment to mild dementia, or from mild to moderate dementia. These are significant changes that have a profound effect on patients and their families.",

      "But, Dr. Skovronsky said, it is difficult to compare data across trials because the studies had different patient populations \u2014 the Leqembi patients had less severe Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 and different designs. The M.R.I. scans were done on different schedules, and the way the scans are read can vary.",

      "Some 186,702 of the 3.2 million deaths in the United States in 2022 were caused by Covid. The virus contributed to another 58,284 deaths for which it was not deemed the underlying cause. A large proportion of Covid deaths occurred during the first months of 2022.",

      "Nearly 35,000 people have died of Covid so far this year, he added. The number of total deaths in the United States is still higher than it was before the pandemic, which was 2.9 million, suggesting that Covid has had a broader effect on death rates generally. The outbreak led some people to defer health care, for example, and exacerbated other illnesses they might have had.",
      "\u201cWe would expect some increase in the number of deaths because the population is aging, but this is far and above what we would have expected without the pandemic,\u201d Dr. Anderson said.",
      "Men, adults age 85 or older and Native American or Alaska Native people were much more likely than other Americans to have died of Covid last year. By contrast, Asian Americans and children ages 5 to 14 had the lowest death rates.",
      "Black Americans and Native American or Alaska Native people had the highest age-adjusted death rates from all causes. Death rates were lowest for multiracial and Asian individuals.",

      "While there were no fatalities recorded in the use of the holds by that department, neurologists say the dangers of neck compression are indisputable.",
      "Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, explained that chokeholds and strangleholds could kill or cause brain injuries in two ways. They can compress the trachea, preventing the person from getting air into the lungs. And they can compress the carotid arteries, which are on either side of the neck, adjacent to the trachea. Seventy percent of the blood going to the brain passes through the carotids, Dr. Saadi said. If that blood flow is cut off in a chokehold or a stranglehold, some people can become unconscious in three to four seconds. If the flow continues to be restricted, a person can die within three to four minutes.",

      "The story, as often happens in science, sounded so appealing. Cells have a molecular clock that determines how long they live. If you can just stop the clock, cells can live indefinitely. And the same should go for people, who are, after all, made from cells. Stop the cell clocks and you can remain youthful.",
      "The clocks come in the form of caps on the end of chromosomes \u2014 the long twisted strings of DNA carrying the cells\u2019 genes. The caps on chromosomes, called telomeres, are chains of short, repeated segments of DNA. Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get a little shorter, until finally they get so short that the cell dies.",
      "\u201cShort telomeres were thought to be bad \u2014 people with premature aging syndromes had short telomeres \u2014 so, by analogy, long telomeres were thought to be good,\u201d said Dr. Mary Armanios, professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the Telomere Center at the medical school\u2019s Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. \u201cAnd the longer the better.\u201d",

      " published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine, with results of a study that Dr. Armanios led, shows that the telomere story is no exception. While short telomeres do lead to health problems, long telomeres lead to health problems of their own. Far from extending life, long telomeres appear to cause cancer and a blood disorder known as CHIP, a condition that increases the risk of blood cancers and heart disease.",
      "Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, an emerita professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who shared a Nobel Prize for the discovery of an enzyme involved in making telomeres and who was not involved in the study, said it was a \u201cbeautiful paper\u201d that went beyond correlations to show a direct link between long telomeres and disease. She added that the research \u201cenlightens this whole trade-off.\u201d",
      "For Dr. Armanios, it is the culmination of work she began 20 years ago.",
      "When scientists started studying telomeres, they observed that young people had longer ones than older people. When cells are grown in the lab, their telomeres act as sort of a ticking clock, determining how long they have to live.",
      "Soon, telomeres were hailed as a secret to aging \u2014 companies advertised that they could tell your biological age by measuring the length of your telomeres. Others said that you could extend your life by preserving your telomeres with supplements.",
      "But Dr. Armanios and other researchers had ",
      " that telomere lengths seemed constrained to a narrow range, indicating there is a price to pay for very long or very short telomeres.",

      "Dr. Armanios, as a human geneticist, thought the way to get answers was to study humans. \u201cThere are things you just can\u2019t infer from studying cells,\u201d she said.",
      "She suspected, she said, that \u201cyou just can\u2019t elongate telomeres without a price,\u201d and began looking for people with very long telomeres to ask what that price might be.",
      "She decided to look for people with a common genetic mutation, POT1, that can result in long telomeres. It was known to increase cancer risk but most researchers thought it was for reasons other than lengthening telomeres.",
      "She ended up with 17 people from five families. They ranged in age from 7 to 83 and had extraordinarily long telomeres.",
      "They also had tumors, ranging from benign, like goiters and uterine fibroids, to malignant, like those from melanoma and blood cancers. During the two-year study, four patients died of a variety of cancers.",
      "Harriet Brown, 73, of Frederick, Md., is one of the study participants with very long telomeres. She has had benign tumors called paragangliomas in her neck and throat, thyroid cancer and two melanomas. She also has CHIP, the blood disorder associated with heart disease and blood cancers.",
      "She has frequent scans and exams but, she said, \u201cthere is really not much I can do at this point,\u201d because there is no way to prevent more tumors from developing.",
      "The effects of long telomeres on people like Ms. Brown make perfect sense, said Dr. Norman Sharpless, professor of cancer policy and innovation at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and a former director of the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that long telomeres make cells grow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that they don\u2019t have the brakes to make them stop growing.\u201d And because the telomeres of people with POT1 mutations do not grow shorter with each cell division, the cells hang around, dividing regularly. The longer they are dividing in the body, the more time they have to accumulate random mutations, some of which prompt tumor growth.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in blood, where cells are constantly being produced. POT1 mutations in some of these blood cells can give them time to accumulate other mutations that give them a selective advantage in growth. Soon some of these mutated blood cells pretty much take over a person\u2019s bone marrow. The result is CHIP.",
      "That is a new view of CHIP. The thought had been that because people with CHIP were at increased risk for blood cancer, that CHIP itself was causing cancer.",
      "Instead, Dr. Armanios said, it\u2019s that long telomeres are both creating CHIP and, independently, giving cells time to develop cancer-causing mutations.",
      "\u201cAging biology is a lot more complicated than we\u2019d hoped,\u201d Dr. Sharpless said.",
      "Or, as Dr. Blackburn observed: Long telomeres are not the secret to eternal youth.",
      "\u201cThere is no free lunch,\u201d she said."

      "The World Health Organization announced on Friday that it was ending the emergency it declared for Covid-19 more than three years ago, a milestone in the fitful emergence from a pandemic that has killed millions of people around the world and upended daily life in previously unimaginable ways.",
      "\u201cIt is with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\u201d said the W.H.O. director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.",
      "But W.H.O. officials warned that the decision to lift the emergency does not signal an end to the pandemic, and cautioned countries not take this as reason to dismantle Covid response systems. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the W.H.O. technical lead on Covid, said the organization wanted to be as clear as possible knowing that people would wonder how to think about the pandemic going forward.",
      "\u201cThe emergency phase is over, but Covid is not,\u201d she said.",
      "Indeed, in practical terms, the decision to end the emergency changes little. Many countries have already ended their own states of emergency for Covid, and have moved away from almost all public health restrictions implemented to control the virus. The United States will lift its Covid emergency on May 11. But the lifting of the W.H.O. designation \u2014 officially called a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d \u2014 is a significant moment in the evolving human relationship with the novel coronavirus.",
      "Dr. K. Srinath Reddy, who led India\u2019s Public Health Foundation through the pandemic, said the decision to lift the emergency was appropriate, because of the high levels globally of immunity to Covid, induced by vaccination or infection, or both.",
      "\u201cIt no longer possesses the same level of danger,\u201d he said, adding that Covid \u201chas achieved a level of equilibrium, a certain type of coexistence with the human host.\u201d",
      "Dr. Reddy said the end of the emergency status should also be appreciated as a moment of human achievement and a \u201ccelebration of science.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that what made the virus change its character is not only evolutionary biology,\u201d he said, \u201cbut also the fact that we have induced it to actually become less virulent, by vaccination, by masks, by a number of public health measures.\u201d",
      "Globally, there have been ",
      ", including 6,921,614 deaths, reported to the W.H.O. as of May 3. But these figures are a vast undercount of the pandemic\u2019s true toll. \u201cWe know the true toll is several times higher, at least 20 million,\u201d Dr. Tedros said.",
      "A year ago the W.H.O. said that ",
      ", a figure that laid bare how vastly countries had undercounted victims. In Egypt, excess deaths were roughly 12 times as great as the official Covid toll; in Pakistan, the figure was eight times as high. Developing nations bore the brunt of the devastation, with nearly eight million more people than expected dying in lower-middle-income nations by the end of 2021.",
      "\u201cCovid-19 has been so much more than a health crisis: it has caused severe social upheaval,\u201d said Dr. Tedros, describing crippled economies, closed borders, shuttered schools and millions of people suffering in isolation.",
      "\u201cCovid-19 exposed and exacerbated political fault-lines within and between nations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has eroded trust between people, governments and institutions fueled by a torrent of myths and misinformation. It has laid bare the searing inequalities of our world, with the poorest and most vulnerable communities the hardest hit and the last to receive access to vaccines and other tools.\u201d",
      "The W.H.O. leaders who addressed the media about the ending of the emergency described the moment as an emotional one. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Dr. Van Kerkhove said. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget the images of the hospital ICUs filled to capacity, the images of medical gloves filled with warm water holding the hands of our loved ones who died, with health care workers who ensured that they didn\u2019t die alone. We can\u2019t forget the fire pyres or the mass graves that were dug.\u201d",
      "Covid, she noted, continues to spread: The W.H.O. recorded ",
      ", and more than 17,000 deaths, from April 3 to 30, the most recent numbers available. As many countries have reduced their testing for Covid, these numbers also probably represent a significant undercount.",
      "The W.H.O.\u2019s emergency declaration was a crucial piece of guidance when it was made on Jan. 30, 2020, when just 213 people were known to have died of the virus. It signaled to the world that this new virus posed a threat outside of China, where it emerged, and gave countries critical buttressing to impose potentially unpopular or disruptive public health measures.",
      "The virus that jumped into humans in late 2019 proved to be an unpredictable adversary, mutating swiftly and significantly in ways that allowed it to resurge and devastate countries just as they thought the worst was past.",
      "A brutal wave of the Delta variant ravaged India just weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi bragged about how well the country had done in its Covid response. The Omicron variant, while less virulent, spread with a deceptive ease that made it ",
      " in 2022, and a major killer in many other countries.",
      "The first large-scale vaccinations began on Dec. 8, 2020, less than a year after the first case of the disease was reported to the W.H.O., an extraordinary triumph of science. But the collaborative process of vaccine development was followed by a grim period of hoarding and nationalism; a full year later, when people in industrialized countries were receiving second and third doses of the vaccine, ",
      " had been vaccinated.",
      "Dr. Githinji Gitahi, executive director of Amref Health Africa, said it was time to lift the emergency. \u201cThe danger of keeping it forever is diluting the tool \u2014 you need it to retain its force,\u201d he said.",
      "The declaration helped to mobilize resources for Africa, he said, but did nothing to counter the bleak experience of what he called \u201cvaccine injustice.\u201d Amref continues to work on supporting vaccination in 35 African countries; continentwide, coverage now stands at 52 percent.",
      "The pandemic also has a positive legacy, Dr. Gitahi said, because it spurred the highest level of cooperation ever seen among African countries, including the creation of an African Union task force to coordinate procurement of vaccines. The Covid response has led to increased capacity and investment in many African countries in areas such as genomic sequencing and disease surveillance.",
      "The W.H.O. decision was not welcomed by all health experts. Dr. Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and member of Brazil\u2019s National Academy of Medicine who was one of that country\u2019s most prominent experts guiding the public through Covid, said it was too soon to lift the emergency, given that there are still urgent tasks such as research into Covid variants and development of multivalent vaccines. The designation of global public health emergency also creates leverage for lower-income nations to access treatments and support, she said.",
      "On May 3, the W.H.O. issued ",
      ", which it said was intended to guide countries on how to manage Covid over the next two years as they transition from emergency response to long-term Covid prevention and control.",
      "Opening the Geneva meeting where W.H.O. experts decided to end the emergency, Dr. Tedros told the committee that for each of the past 10 weeks, the number of weekly reported Covid deaths had been the lowest since March 2020. As a consequence, life has returned to normal in most countries and health systems are rebuilding, he said.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, some critical uncertainties about the evolution of the virus persist, which make it difficult to predict future transmission dynamics or seasonality,\u201d he said. \u201cSurveillance and genetic sequencing have declined significantly around the world, making it more difficult to track known variants and detect new ones.\u201d",
      "And access to lifesaving Covid treatments continues to be sharply unequal globally, he said.",
      "Dr. Dalcolmo said the lifting of the global emergency should be viewed not as a milestone, but as a warning. \u201cTake this as an alert, a time to start being prepared for the next pandemic,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we know respiratory viruses are going to increase.\u201d"

      "Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will step down from her position on June 30, she announced on Friday, capping a tumultuous tenure at the nation\u2019s leading public health agency as it struggled to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic, the greatest threat to American well-being in decades.",
      "Her departure comes as the administration contends with major vacancies in its Covid-19 response team. Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House\u2019s Covid-19 coordinator, plans to leave his position this month, along with other key officials, including Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, a White House adviser on the global response. A new White House pandemic office has no leader or staffing.",
      "The administration plans to end the public health emergency on May 11, closing major programs \u2014 like access to free tests \u2014 that had helped sustain Americans through the worst days of the pandemic.",
      "But the virus has not disappeared. It is still killing roughly 1,000 Americans each week and hospitalizing even more. The leadership vacuum arrives at a precarious time.",
      "In an agencywide meeting, Dr. Walensky admitted to having mixed emotions about her decision and broke down in tears, according to people who had been on a conference call with her.",
      "\u201cI took on this role with the goal of leaving behind the dark days of the pandemic and moving the C.D.C. \u2014 and public health \u2014 into a much better and more trusted place,\u201d she said in a subsequent email to the agency\u2019s staff.",
      "Dr. Walensky did not respond to a request for comment. Senior administration officials and outside experts have said that Dr. Walensky struggled with an unwieldy leadership structure at the Department of Health and Human Services, of which the C.D.C. is a part. The agency\u2019s relationship with the White House was sometimes tense, as her advice to the public ",
      ".",
      "A person familiar with her thinking said that Dr. Walensky had also wearied of harassment from members of the public who were unhappy with pandemic restrictions and of long commutes between the C.D.C.\u2019s offices in Atlanta and her home in Massachusetts.",
      "Andy Slavitt, a key adviser on the White House Covid-19 team in 2021, praised Dr. Walensky\u2019s efforts to do a job \u201cthat\u2019s easy to criticize and tough to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou show up in an emergency status with a specific job to do,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a mission, with a beginning and end. Even though she was running an agency, running an agency during wartime is different than running an agency during peacetime.\u201d",
      "Public health experts said the news had come as a surprise, and some expressed disappointment that she was leaving.",
      "\u201cI think it is a loss for the C.D.C. and for the nation,\u201d said Dr. Megan Ranney, the deputy dean for Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cI know that it has not been easy, not just because of Covid but because of the politicization of science.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ranney said that she had received hate mail and personal attacks but that what she had experienced was \u201conly the tip of the iceberg\u201d compared with how Dr. Walensky had been treated.",
      "Dr. Celine Gounder, a former adviser to the Biden administration who has known Dr. Walensky since 2004, said, \u201cHer departure signals to me that the C.D.C. is more broken and the federal government\u2019s commitment to public health is even weaker than I\u2019d thought.\u201d",
      "Dr. Walensky grew up in Potomac, Md., in a family of respected scientists. She trained in medicine at Johns Hopkins University and, in 2001, joined the faculty at Harvard, where she developed a reputation as a rigorous researcher and a generous mentor.",
      "Before her tenure as C.D.C. director, Dr. Walensky led the infectious diseases division at Massachusetts General Hospital, where she saw the pandemic\u2019s devastation firsthand. She was noted for her work on health care policy, particularly in H.I.V.",
      "But with little experience working in government and leading large institutions, Dr. Walensky was an unexpected choice to guide an agency with a staff of about 11,000 people.",
      "Dr. Walensky took the helm of the beleaguered agency in January 2021. She had a near-impossible task ahead of her: restoring the reputation of the once-storied C.D.C. when public trust in the agency, and science more broadly, was fast ebbing.",
      "The C.D.C. had been pilloried since the start of the pandemic for missteps in testing, changing advice on masking, and antiquated surveillance and data systems. Trump administration officials hectored the agency\u2019s leaders, rewrote its guidance and meddled with its research reports, undermining the morale of scientists even as the crisis ballooned.",
      "\u201cShe insisted that people act more promptly and in a more focused way, so she stimulated people to do things perhaps a little bit differently than they had,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases physician at Vanderbilt University who works closely with the agency.",
      "\u201cMorale within the C.D.C. distinctly improved under her leadership,\u201d he added.",
      "But the pandemic proved to be rough ground even for someone as respected and ",
      " as Dr. Walensky. She was roundly criticized by experts for advising people to stop wearing their masks just weeks before the Delta variant of the coronavirus pummeled the nation.",
      "And after shortening isolation requirements even as the Omicron variant brought the country to a standstill, she was accused of letting economic interests outweigh scientific caution.",
      "Anne Sosin, who studies health equity at Dartmouth, said that Dr. Walensky had sometimes taken the fall for Biden administration decisions, but that she also could have done more to level with the public about the rationales for those decisions.",
      "Still, Ms. Sosin added, \u201cFrom the outside, it has sometimes appeared that Dr. Walensky has lacked the courage to say no to decisions that really undermined public health.\u201d",
      "Republicans in Congress repeatedly asked for her resignation and painted the agency as a failed institution in hearings on the pandemic. But some experts felt Dr. Walensky had done her best with an impossible hand.",
      "\u201cThe public \u2014 and even health professionals \u2014 wanted consistency in message and messaging that was not possible, because Covid has simply never been a static threat,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician and health policy expert at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.",
      "Dr. Daniel Pollock, who led Covid surveillance for a few months in 2020 and retired in November 2021 after 37 years at the agency, said: \u201cThe timing of this leadership transition is very problematic. I worked at C.D.C. under 10 different directors, and when they leave abruptly, for whatever reason, the ripple effects take a big toll.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear who would lead the C.D.C. after Dr. Walensky\u2019s departure. Some scientists said Dr. Walensky\u2019s successor should be a public health generalist attuned to social problems and how to run a large federal agency, not a physician-scientist like Dr. Walensky.",
      "\u201cThis has to be a public health person,\u201d said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who writes a ",
      " and has been advising the C.D.C. for the past year. \u201cWe think about treating millions of people at one time, rather than this initial training of one-on-one physician care.\u201d",
      "Despite the controversy surrounding her tenure, Dr. Walensky\u2019s email to staff members on Friday suggested that she believed she had improved the agency\u2019s standing.",
      "\u201cWe collectively moved C.D.C. forward, reorganizing the agency and embarking on the necessary work to orient the enterprise toward public health action and foster accountability, timeliness and transparency in our work,\u201d she said.",
      "During her time at the C.D.C., Dr. Walensky noted, the agency administered more than 670 million Covid vaccine doses and provided guidance on immunization, social distancing and masking that \u201cprotected the country and the world from the greatest infectious disease threat we have seen in over 100 years.\u201d",
      "Dr. Walensky ",
      " last year and promised to reorganize it, transforming its ability to respond quickly to public health crises. Some organizational changes have been announced, but it is unclear whether any of them have made a material difference in the C.D.C.\u2019s work.",
      "Among other changes, Dr. Walensky helped create an office that\u2019s more organized and empowered to work with state and local health developments, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Health.",
      "\u201cIt puts the agency in a position to have a vision for how the nation\u2019s very convoluted public health system holds together,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the jobs as the director is going to be to take the structure that Dr. Walensky has left and use it.\u201d",
      "Under her leadership, Dr. Walensky said in her email to staff members, the agency bolstered its public health infrastructure and secured hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize the country\u2019s data infrastructure.",
      "She also declared racism a serious public health threat, she noted, and led the agency in its efforts to contain a multinational mpox outbreak, as well as the spread of Ebola in Uganda.",

We can argue about such things. But they\u2019re beside the point right now. America in 2023 isn\u2019t like, say, Greece in 2009 or Argentina in 2001, cut off by investors because they have lost faith in our solvency.",

      "Even these projections may understate the likely damage. Until now, the world has viewed U.S. government debt as the ultimate safe asset; as a result, Treasury bills play a crucial role as ",
      " in many financial transactions. Make these bills unsafe \u2014 I.O.U.s that the U.S. may not honor \u2014 and the whole global financial system could freeze up.",

      " for a few days in March 2020, and it\u2019s not clear whether a rescue could be engineered in today\u2019s political environment.",
      "So what can be done? Let\u2019s not make a deal: Republicans are effectively engaged in a fiscal version of Jan. 6, using the threat of destruction in an attempt to exert total control even though voters gave them only one house of Congress. President Biden shouldn\u2019t give in to extortion, let alone make any deal acquiescing to demands of the extremists who control the House G.O.P.",

      ".",
      "Beyond that, there are those gimmicks. Yes, they would be gimmicks. I don\u2019t have space to explain premium bonds, but they would involve playing games with the definition of \u201cdebt.\u201d As for the platinum coin, the law allowing the government to mint a trillion-dollar coin was never intended as a way to bypass debt-limit extortion \u2014 but the debt limit was never intended to provide a mechanism for extortion, either.",
      "And there are no significant economic downsides to using these gimmicks. I\u2019ve been shocked to see people who should know better, including ",

      "I\u2019m not sure what specific approach the Biden administration will adopt. But the guiding rule should be to do whatever it takes to get through this \u2014 whatever it takes, that is, other than giving in to extortion."

      "She was 20 years old and living in Honolulu on the morning of Aug. 6, 1945, when the United States dropped a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima. It detonated directly over the neighborhood where her family \u2014 including her grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins \u2014 lived. The bomb destroyed the city and killed over 100,000 people. She was told that only one uncle survived.",
      "Scientists estimate that during the explosion the ground temperature ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Celsius \u2014 hot enough to transform a human body into a fine black dust. When I think of that day, I imagine our family gathering around a table for breakfast and ending up in the wind.",
      "I have never been to Hiroshima, but for a long time I have felt a strong desire to connect physically with this part of my family\u2019s history. I have been searching for things that survived \u2014 an heirloom, a letter, a bracelet.",
      "Unexpectedly, the objects that have offered me the most meaningful connection to Hiroshima are not objects at all but living, breathing things: trees.",
      "Ginkgo trees, to be precise.",
      "The ginkgo \u2014 a species native to China with fan-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant gold in the fall \u2014 is one of the oldest and most resilient trees on earth. These trees survived the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs and were some of the only living things to survive the bomb, which they managed to do because their roots grow deep enough in the soil that they were protected from the incinerating heat.",

      "I will visit the place where our family once lived, and I\u2019ll visit the hibakujumoku, the mothers and grandmothers of the saplings I have come to know so well. I will feel their leaves and tell them that we made it, that we survived."

Donald Trump prevailed in North Carolina that same year, but only barely.",

      "How can I be sure? That earlier court ruling voided a Republican-drawn map that probably would have led to a U.S. House delegation of 10 Republicans and four Democrats, while the replacement map yielded the current, appropriate split of seven and seven.

      "\u201cThis round of gerrymandering may be even worse,\u201d Asher Hildebrand, a fellow professor of mine at Duke University who studies the issue, told me.

      "\u201cPrima Facie,\u201d a searing new play on Broadway, is about a high-flying woman whose vitality and confidence is taken from her twice, first when she\u2019s raped by a colleague, Julian, and then when she tries to seek justice. Jodie Comer \u2014 Villanelle on the cult TV show \u201cKilling Eve\u201d \u2014 plays Tessa, a swaggering self-made British barrister who often defends men accused of sexual assault, before she\u2019s assaulted herself and ends up on the other side of the legal process. The story is schematic and the script, by the end, turns didactic, but Comer\u2019s blazing, magnificent performance elevates the show into greatness. She makes you feel viscerally both Tessa\u2019s extraordinary life force, and the leeching of it.",
      "I kept thinking about \u201cPrima Facie\u201d as I sat in the Manhattan courtroom where E. Jean Carroll is suing Donald Trump for battery and defamation stemming from a rape that she alleges occurred in the mid-1990s. The barrister defending Tessa\u2019s rapist accuses her of making up the attack because of a professional vendetta. He suggests she could have screamed, and uses her fragmented memories to make her seem dishonest or unreliable. \u201cThe lived experience of sexual assault is not remembered in a neat, consistent, scientific parcel,\u201d Tessa says. \u201cAnd because of that, the law often finds the evidence \u2018unbelievable.\u2019\u201d",
      "We don\u2019t yet know what the law will find in Carroll\u2019s case. Both sides rested on Thursday \u2014 the Trump camp declined to call a single witness \u2014 and closing arguments are scheduled for Monday. I am, frankly, a little worried, not because I doubt Carroll and those testifying on her behalf, but because I have no idea what the jury, which consists of six men and three women, will make of the witnesses and their decades-old memories. Whatever happens, the few days I\u2019ve been in court have underlined to me what an ordeal this must be for Carroll and some of the other witnesses, their lives splayed open for public consumption, every seeming inconsistency in their recollections or behavior exploited. No matter how much you hate Trump, this isn\u2019t fun for anyone.",
      "Hatred of Trump is a major theme for Trump\u2019s pit bull attorney, Joe Tacopina. Two of Carroll\u2019s friends, Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin, testified that Carroll told them that Trump had assaulted her shortly after it happened. Both have the same feelings about Trump as almost every New York City woman I know, which is to say they loathe him; Birnbach once compared him to an \u201cinfection like herpes.\u201d Tacopina, who has access to years of their emails and text messages, has tried to use their resistance politics against them, implying that they cooked up a plot to frame the ex-president.",
      "He took a similar tack with Jessica Leeds, one of the two supporting witnesses who also allege Trump assaulted them. Leeds testified that Trump groped her on a plane in the late 1970s, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like he had 40 zillion hands, and it was a tussling match between the two of us.\u201d She said Trump called her the C-word when they ran into each other years later, a degrading little coda. In court, Tacopina questioned Leeds about her politics \u2014 \u201cYou just testified you are a registered Democrat?\u201d \u2014 and her long silence about what she says Trump did to her. \u201cYou held it in for those 40 years until he was running for president?\u201d he asked, his tone thick with incredulity.",
      "In the story Tacopina is constructing, all these women are acting out of spite. But the miserable process they\u2019re enduring belies this narrative; it\u2019s hard to imagine any of them, let alone all of them, agreeing to submit to public humiliation, and the attendant threats from Trump\u2019s acolytes, just so they can perjure themselves in the vain hope of tarnishing the ex-president\u2019s political career.",
      "Carroll has had to testify to the end of her romantic life: \u201cI\u2019m aware that I have lost out on one of the glorious experiences of any human being.\u201d A glamorous woman who always presents a fabulous front, she had to sit and listen while a therapist testified about how Carroll\u2019s trauma manifested itself, and how she avoids introspection.",
      "She had to hear texts in which Martin vents about Carroll read into the record. Seemingly resentful of being dragged into a lawsuit, Martin called Carroll a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and said she was acting \u201cscary\u201d and \u201cloving the adulation.\u201d Never mind that this cuts against the idea of Martin as an eager conspirator. No one wants to hear cruel things their friends have said about them privately made public.",
      "And, of course, Carroll, like several of the women who testified for her, had to abide insinuations that she\u2019s a mendacious fantasist. She had to explain why she didn\u2019t scream or go to the police, and even why she kept returning to Bergdorf Goodman if she\u2019d had such a horrifying experience there. At one point one of her attorneys asked if she ever regretted going public. \u201cAbout five times a day,\u201d she said, and I can believe it.",
      "Ultimately, Carroll has more to lose here than Trump does. He is immune to shame and can afford to pay whatever damages might be levied. He\u2019s succeeded in deforming American politics to the point that even if a civil jury finds that in Carroll\u2019s favor, it probably won\u2019t hurt him in the Republican primary. For Carroll, the potential fallout of failing to persuade a jury \u2014 one in liberal New York City, no less \u2014 is more grave. If she claims her reputation was damaged by Trump calling her a liar, it will be damaged much more by a jury verdict to that effect.",
      "\u201cI feel a wave of sadness. Not despair just pure sadness,\u201d Tessa says in \u201cPrima Facie\u201d after testifying against her assailant. \u201cI know the jury won\u2019t find Julian guilty.\u201d She is right; they don\u2019t. \u201cAll of this and, and \u2014 they didn\u2019t believe me,\u201d she said.",
      "I can scarcely imagine what it would be mean for Carroll, who testified that being raped by Trump disfigured her enviable life, to end up in the same place as Tessa. If I were her, I doubt I\u2019d have the courage to risk it."

      ". Or the revelatory ",
      ". She has had a distinguished career in the U.S. Senate, but her infirmities and illness now force her \u2014 and Senate leaders like Charles Schumer \u2014 to make a painful choice.",
      "At age 89, Ms. Feinstein is now the Senate\u2019s oldest member, and health issues have kept her out of Washington and the Senate chamber for more than two months, at a time when vital legislation and judicial nominations are hanging on a knife\u2019s edge. If she cannot fulfill her obligations to the Senate and to her constituents, she should resign and turn over her responsibilities to an appointed successor. If she is unable to reach that decision on her own, Mr. Schumer, the majority leader, and other Democratic senators should make it clear to her and the public how important it is that she do so.",
      "Senators play many roles in shaping legislation and policy, but they have one primary and inescapable duty: They must show up in person to vote in the chamber. If they cannot do that for extended periods, they are depriving their constituents \u2014 and California has 39 million of them \u2014 of a voice and of fundamental representation. In six elections, voters have sent Ms. Feinstein to Washington on a Democratic platform, and in the current term of Congress, that agenda consists of confirming judges nominated by the Biden administration and preserving a majority for important legislation in a closely divided Senate. Her absence is a failure that deprives American voters of full representation on legislation and appointments that will affect them for decades to come.",
      "Without Ms. Feinstein\u2019s presence at proceedings of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats have lacked a majority there and ",
      " to the floor. (Proxy voting is allowed in the committee, but a proxy cannot be the decisive vote if the committee is otherwise evenly divided, as it often is.) Currently, seven of President Biden\u2019s judicial nominees are awaiting a vote in the committee, at a time when 9 percent of district and appellate court seats remain vacant. Ms. Feinstein offered to step away from the committee, but ",

She cannot keep up with conversations, her colleagues said; she doesn\u2019t seem to fully recognize other senators and relies almost entirely on staff members, to a much greater extent than other senators do. She\u2019s announced that she will not run for re-election in 2024, but until then, her staff is, in effect, assuming the authority entrusted to her by California\u2019s voters.",
      "It\u2019s a deeply saddening situation, but even the most dedicated public servants cannot serve forever, and they may be the last to realize or act upon their incapacity. Fitness for elective office can be measured in different ways. Some people are unfit on the day they first set foot in Congress, because of their character or ethical failings; others do stellar work for decades but gradually lose their effectiveness. In each case, constituents are the losers, and American institutions should be strong enough to have mechanisms to protect voters from a lack of representation.",
      "In the Senate, that task falls to Mr. Schumer and his leadership colleagues. Ms. Feinstein has put them in a difficult position by saying she wants to come back, and plans to do so, but without ever giving an indication of when that will be. ",
      " that he hoped she would be back next week. But Ms. Feinstein\u2019s office has not confirmed that, and ",
      " for her return, the only way for voters to gauge her effectiveness. Under the circumstances, Mr. Schumer should turn up the public pressure on her to return or resign, setting aside the antique Senate gentility that can hobble common-sense decision making there.",
      "Putting any kind of public pressure on Ms. Feinstein has been criticized by the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and others as sexist. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them go after a man who was sick in the Senate in that way,\u201d ",
      ". It\u2019s true that the Senate, which has always been entirely or mostly male, has experienced long absences by some of its male members. In the 1940s, Senator Carter Glass of Virginia was absent for four years because of heart trouble. Senator Karl Mundt of South Dakota had a stroke in 1969 and never really came back in the following three years. ",
      ", Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina was wheeled to the Senate floor to cast votes, despite widespread concern about his mental fitness. In all of those cases, as with Ms. Feinstein, the senators ignored concerns about their capacity and pleas from their colleagues as long as they could.",
      "This Senate tradition should have been discarded long ago. Senate seats are not lifetime sinecures, and if members can\u2019t effectively represent their constituents or work for the benefit of their country, they should not hesitate to turn the job over to someone who can. Ms. Feinstein owes California a responsible decision.",

      "In the early 1960s typical Americans were eager to get on with adult life. As soon as they could, they married, launched careers and started popping out kids. In those days, half of all women married before their 20th birthday.",
      "Then the boomers came of age. Typical members of that generation wanted to enjoy their freedom, so many put off marriage and parenting until their late 20s or their 30s. They adopted what some researchers call the \u201cslow life strategy,\u201d postponing the common milestones of adulthood until later in life.",
      "As the psychologist Jean Twenge shows in her lavishly informative new book, \u201cGenerations,\u201d the members of Gen Z are now practicing the slow life strategy with a vengeance.",
      "They have already transformed adolescence. Members of Gen Z are, for example, content to get their driver\u2019s licenses later than earlier generations. As high school seniors, they are less likely to do the things associated with adulthood and independence, like drinking alcohol, working for pay or having sex. When members of Gen X were in ninth grade, nearly 40 percent of them had had sex. By 2021, only 15 percent of the Gen Z ninth graders had.",
      "As Twenge puts it: \u201cIn many ways, 18-year-olds now look like 14-year-olds in previous generations. For example, only about half of 12th graders date, about the same as eighth graders in the early 1990s.\u201d",
      "Twenge is not rendering a judgment here; she\u2019s not saying that one generation is living the right way or the wrong way. Young people today are simply taking their time.",
      "It makes perfect sense. People are living longer. If it\u2019s now possible to run for president at age 80, then it\u2019s prudent and wise to pace yourself through life, and not try to cram everything into those first unsteady decades.",
      "But something else is going on here. Gen Z-ers grew up with hypercautious parenting that exaggerates the dangers in life. They grew up in a media culture that generates ratings and clicks by generating division and anger. They grew up in a political culture that magnifies a sense of menace \u2014 that presumes that other people are toxic \u2014 in order to tell simplistic us/them stories and mobilize people\u2019s fears.",
      "This culture of exaggerated distrust and presumed toxicity has influenced us all, but the younger generations most of all. On the one hand it\u2019s made them hypervigilant to danger. Since 2011 the number of kids who have had to go to the emergency room for nonfatal injuries has plummeted. Members of Gen Z are less likely to do drugs or get into fights or car accidents than were teens in previous generations.",
      "On the other hand this culture has induced \u2014 in all of us, but especially in the young \u2014 an aversion to risk.",
      "In 1991, 48 percent of eighth and 10th graders said they liked to take risks sometimes. By 2021, that number had plunged to 32 percent.",
      "People who grow up in this culture of distrust are bound to adopt self-protective codes of behavior. I\u2019ve been teaching college students on and off for 25 years. Over the last few years, students have become much less willing to argue with one another in class. They don\u2019t want to be viciously judged. It\u2019s not even that they are consciously afraid of being canceled. It\u2019s simply that the norm of non-argumentativeness in public has settled over many (but not all) parts of campus culture.",
      "People who grow up in a culture of distrust are bound to be pessimistic about life. Since around 2012, the share of 12th graders who expect to earn a graduate or professional degree, get a professional job or own more than their parents has plummeted (even though, as Twenge shows, their brothers and sisters in the millennial generation are doing better and better). ",
      "People who grow up with this mentality are also less likely to believe they can control their own destinies. In her book, Twenge has a chart showing the share of 12th graders who believe that their lives are blown about by outside forces has been surging since 2006. That matters, she writes, because people who go through life with this defeatist attitude have worse life outcomes.",
      "As a certified middle-aged guy, I\u2019m glad that the members of Gen Z behave so much more responsibly than members of previous generations. Politically, they lean left, but dispositionally they are cautious and conservative.",
      "But the sense of exaggerated menace has its downsides. Twenge describes a moment when she was telling some Gen Z women about a lady who had met her future husband when he hit on her in an elevator in their office building. That would almost never happen today, the young women told Twenge. His behavior would be considered creepy and stalkerish.",
      "It\u2019s always good to be on guard against a dangerous creep, but you may miss out on meeting the person who could be the love of your life."

I\u2019m not quoting breathless journalism about rising crime or conservative talking points about America falling into ruin. The ruin I\u2019m thinking of isn\u2019t in San Francisco or Chicago or at the southern border. The ruin is woven into the fabric of America. It\u2019s seeping into all of us. All across the country, supposedly good, upstanding citizens are often fatally enforcing ever-changing, arbitrary and personal norms for how we conduct ourselves.",
      "In Kansas City, Mo., Ralph Yarl, a Black 16-year-old, rang the wrong doorbell. He was trying to pick up his younger brothers and was simply on the wrong street, Northeast 115th Street instead of Northeast 115th Terrace, a harmless mistake.

Mr. Oropesa walked over to the father\u2019s house and has been charged with killing five people, including an 8-year-old boy, with an AR-15-style rifle.

I\u2019m ready to die.\u201d Was he making people uncomfortable? I\u2019m sure he was. But his were the words of a man in pain. He did not physically harm anyone. And the consequence for causing discomfort isn\u2019t death unless, of course, it is. A former Marine held Mr. Neely in a chokehold for several minutes, killing the man. News reports keep saying Mr. Neely died, which is a passive thing. We die of old age. We die in a car accident. We die from disease. When someone holds us in a chokehold for several minutes, something far worse has occurred.",
      "A man actively brought about Mr. Neely\u2019s death. No one appears to have intervened during those minutes to help Mr. Neely, though two men apparently tried to help the former Marine. Did anyone ask the former Marine to release Mr. Neely from his chokehold? The people in that subway car prioritized their own discomfort and anxiety over Mr. Neely\u2019s distress. All of the people in that subway car on Monday will have to live with their apparent inaction and indifference. Now that it\u2019s too late, there are haunting, heartbreaking images of Mr. Neely, helpless and pinned, still being choked. How does something like this happen? How does this senseless, avoidable violence happen? Truly, how? We all need to ask ourselves that question until we come up with an acceptable answer.",
      "In the immediate aftermath, the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, couldn\u2019t set politics aside and acknowledge how horrific Mr. Neely\u2019s death was. Mr. Adams ",
      ": \u201cAny loss of life is tragic. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what happened here.\u201d His was a bland and impotent statement, even though the sequence of events seems pretty clear and was corroborated by video, photography and a witness. And while any loss is in fact tragic, this specific loss, the death of Jordan Neely, was barely addressed. Mr. Adams didn\u2019t bother to say Mr. Neely\u2019s name and went on to equivocate about his administration\u2019s investments in mental health, a strange claim to make while allowing first responders in New York City to involuntarily commit people experiencing mental health crises.",
      "All of these innocent people who lost their lives were in the wrong place at the wrong time. In most cases, armed assailants deputized themselves to stand their ground or enforce justice for a petty crime. Some claimed self-defense, said they were afraid, though some of their victims were unarmed women and children. We have to ask the uncomfortable questions: Why are men so afraid? Why are they so fragile that they shoot or harm first and ask questions later? Why do they believe death or injury is an appropriate response to human fallibility? Public life shared with terrified and/or entitled and/or angry and/or disaffected men is untenable.",
      "We are at something of an impasse. The list of things that can get you killed in public is expanding every single day. Whether it\u2019s mass shootings or police brutality or random acts of violence, it only takes running into one scared man to have the worst and likely last day of your life. We can\u2019t even agree on right and wrong anymore. Instead of addressing actual problems, like homelessness and displacement, lack of physical and mental health care, food scarcity, poverty, lax gun laws and more, we bury our heads in the sand. Only when this unchecked violence comes to our doorstep do we maybe care enough to try to effect change.",
      "There is no patience for simple mistakes or room for addressing how bigotry colors even the most innocuous interactions. There is no regard for due process. People who deem themselves judge, jury and executioner walk among us, and we have no real way of knowing when they will turn on us.",
      "I will be thinking about Jordan Neely in particular for a long time. I will be thinking about who gets to stand his ground, who doesn\u2019t, and how, all too often, it\u2019s people in the latter group who are buried beneath that ground by those who refuse to cede dominion over it. Every single day there are news stories that are individually devastating and collectively an unequivocal condemnation of what we are becoming: a people without empathy, without any respect for the sanctity of life unless it\u2019s our own.",
      "It\u2019s easy, on social media, to say, \u201cI would have done something to help Mr. Neely.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine we would have called for help, offered him some food or money, extended him the grace and empathy we all deserve.",
      "It\u2019s so very easy to think we are good, empathetic people. But time and time again, people like us, who think so highly of themselves, have the opportunity to stand up and do the right thing, and they don\u2019t. What on earth makes us think that, when the time comes, we will be any different?"

One leaf has Guyana, where my parents were born. I know my mother would have looked for it.",
      "Both of my parents were members of what Britons call the Windrush Generation, named for one of the first boats that brought postwar Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. They grew up in a British colony with British symbols and culture all around them. They believed that Britain was the \u201cmother country.\u201d",

But they and their families felt deeply that they were a part of Britain\u2019s struggle against fascism in World War II and that Britain and its allies stood for freedom and democracy.",

She loved the pomp and ceremony of royal events, and her shelves were filled with cheerful memorabilia from the weddings and jubilees. We\u2019d crowd around the television to watch the latest event\u00a0and she\u2019d serve her divine Caribbean cooking on royal cake trays. And I remember our friends and neighbors in Tottenham, a neighborhood in north London: Cockneys and other migrants like her, with accents from half a dozen Caribbean islands, and a few Irish, dropping in for a cup of tea from her royal teapot.",
      "I understand now what my mother was doing: She was using the symbol of the monarchy to bring our street together.",

It\u2019s where I grew up and I\u2019ve been proud to represent it as a member of Parliament for 23 years.

He has returned five times and brought his many charities, without news releases or fanfare. I have been struck by how easily my constituents strike up a conversation with him and by how much he knows about the many Commonwealth countries he has spent his life visiting. In some ways, Charles III has done more for my constituents, some of the poorest people in Britain, than most politicians.",

For them, the monarchy was a symbol of mutual respect, continuity and connection, and the promise of the Commonwealth, of a family of equals \u2014 which Guyana joined upon its independence and remained a member of after it abolished the monarchy in 1970, was real. They saw the royal family working toward it in their visits to the Caribbean and elsewhere.",

He has already opened the royal archives to a research project into the British monarchy\u2019s links to trans-Atlantic slavery. This matters. Only the monarchy has the power \u2014 as the symbolic thread that connects that Britain to my Britain today \u2014 to play this role meaningfully.",

I understood that, too, the morning I first knelt in front of Elizabeth II to become a privy counselor. I felt that I was not just being accepted but was being woven into a national thread.",

The Commonwealth is a unique platform for Britain to reconnect with what are mostly \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 young, ambitious and developing nations beyond the confines of the Group of 7 nations and the Group of 20.",

      "Scientists and activists have long argued at global climate summits that the only way to slow down global warming is to eliminate its main driver, fossil fuel production.",
      "This year\u2019s United Nations-sponsored climate summit, however, will be hosted in the United Arab Emirates, one of the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel producers, and the head of the U.A.E.\u2019s national oil company, Sultan al-Jaber, will preside over the meeting. At the summit, which starts in late November, Mr. al-Jaber will be tasked with ironing out the language of its final document.",
      "On Tuesday, speaking at a separate climate-focused conference in Berlin, Mr. al-Jaber gave some of his clearest hints yet on his hopes for what that document will say. Close watchers of climate politics said they were left feeling cautiously optimistic on the ambitions of Mr. al-Jaber, who is also chairman of the U.A.E.\u2019s state-owned renewable energy company, while some of his word choices left room for ambiguity.",
      "\u201cWe must be laser focused on phasing out fossil fuel emissions, while phasing up viable, affordable zero carbon alternatives,\u201d Mr. al-Jaber said at the conference in Berlin, which is an annual prelude to the larger U.N. conference later in the year. He also called for a tripling of global renewable energy capacity by the end of this decade and said the world was \u201cway off track\u201d in meeting its emissions reductions pledges.",
      "The distinction he made, however, between phasing out fossil fuels entirely and phasing out their emissions left room for confusion and doubt.",
      "\u201cEmissions can be phased out in two ways: Burn less, or use technologies to capture the remaining carbon that is burned,\u201d said Fred Krupp, who has led the Environmental Defense Fund for three decades. Oil producers have emphasized the importance of the latter, which would facilitate the continued burning of fossil fuels.",
      "At a press conference following the speech, responding to questions about his remarks, Mr. al-Jaber said, \u201cWe know fossil fuels will continue to play a role in the foreseeable future in helping meet global energy requirements.\u201d Therefore, he said, the aim should focus on \u201censuring that we phase out emissions from all sectors whether it\u2019s oil and gas or high emitting industries while in parallel we should exert all effort and all investments in renewable energy and clean technology space.\u201d",
      "That stance is in line with the position of oil and gas companies, which have proposed ramping up so-called ",
      " technologies that, while nascent, could help reduce or eliminate carbon emissions from production facilities and potentially elsewhere. ",
      "Advocates for a total phasing out of fossil fuels, who include global authorities such as the International Energy Agency as well as negotiators for the European Union, also support carbon capture technology. Still, they are advocating in global talks for language that would have countries commit to accelerated phasing out of fossil fuel production, saying that pledges to limit global warming are impossible to meet unless new fossil fuel production is halted more or less immediately.",
      "The opposite is happening. Despite a lull during the worst years of the pandemic, oil and gas projects are ",
      ". Historical producers such as the United States and Saudi Arabia are ramping up production, and the exploitation of new oil blocks in places like Guyana and Uganda is just getting underway.",
      "At last year\u2019s climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, countries couldn\u2019t agree on including \u201cphase out\u201d language for all fossil fuels. A year earlier, in Glasgow, that term was included but pertained only to coal, for which, outside China and India, there have already been major declines in production.",
      "\u201cWhile it is correct for al-Jaber to focus on emissions, it is also true that meeting our emissions goals means we\u2019re going to have to be using much less fossil fuels than we do today,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cIt is also true that we will need carbon capture to meet our goals on time. So there\u2019s an element of necessity there. It just can\u2019t be used as cover for a real phasedown.\u201d"

      "President Biden\u2019s ",
      " appears to be encouraging more investment in American manufacturing than initially expected, powering what\u2019s expected to be a surge in new factory jobs and domestic clean energy technologies, according to independent forecasters.",
      "If the boom in new battery factories, wind and solar farms, electric vehicle plants and other investments is sustained, the law could prove even more effective than administration officials had hoped at reducing the fossil fuel emissions that are dangerously heating the planet.",
      "But all that new economic activity centered around green technology is also driving up costs for taxpayers, who are subsidizing the investments.",
      "When Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act last August, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law\u2019s climate and clean energy tax credits would cost roughly ",
      ". But the budget office\u2019s ",
      ", based on estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation, found that the clean energy tax breaks would cost at least $180 billion more than originally forecast over that time period.",
      "Other\u00a0",
      " and ",
      " have estimated that the law\u2019s energy provisions could end up costing as much as $1.2 trillion over the next decade.",

      " to invest at least $150 billion in clean energy projects, including at least 46 new or expanded large-scale factories making everything from wind turbine towers to electric vehicle batteries.",
      " Some companies planned their projects before the climate law passed and would have built them regardless. But others have cited the law as a catalyst, such as Hanwha Qcells, a South Korean solar company, ",
      "\u00a0in Georgia.",
      "\u201cInvestment is moving forward five times faster than ever before,\u201d said Jason Grumet, the chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy trade group. \u201cThe early signs are really encouraging.\u201d",
      "The growth spurt in green energy is happening as ",
      " appear to be cooling off. ",
      "While the climate law was a top priority of the Biden administration and was passed without a single Republican vote, much of the money ",

      "The rush to cash in on the credits has delighted administration officials, environmental activists and clean energy industry groups, who say it is catalyzing a rapid transition from an economy rooted in burning coal, gas and oil to one that runs on renewable sources such as wind and solar power.",
      "But the rising cost estimates have fueled an angry response from Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who cast the vote that was crucial to the law\u2019s passage. Mr. Manchin now faces a potentially difficult re-election campaign that could pit him against Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican who announced last week he will run for the Senate in 2024. West Virginia has increasingly shifted to the right; voters backed Donald J. Trump over Mr. Biden by 39 points in 2020.",

      "The price of the tax credits has also become a focal point in the ongoing standoff between House Republicans and Mr. Biden over raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit and avoiding an economically catastrophic default. The ",
      " to lift the limit would repeal most of the climate tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, which the budget office said would save more than $500 billion over the next decade.",
      "Republicans say the tax credits have distorted markets by steering investment to preferred green technologies. Democrats point to the U.S. tax code that has for decades provided tax incentives for the fossil fuel industry worth an estimated $10 billion to $50 billion per year.",
      "Administration officials say that Republicans who want to repeal the clean energy tax credits would jeopardize the local economy in their own districts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing tens of thousands of jobs being created across the country as a result of this law in just a matter of months. We expect to see even more,\u201d said Kristina Costa, Mr. Biden\u2019s deputy for clean energy implementation and innovation. \u201cThe Republican proposal would roll all of that back.\u201d",
      "Architects of the law say it will reinvigorate American manufacturing in a global competition to produce advanced energy technologies \u2014 and more important, speed the fight against climate change.",
      "\u201cIt will be a net job creator, for sure,\u201d said Brian Deese, Mr. Biden\u2019s former National Economic Council director, who stepped down in February. But the larger economic benefit, he said, would be \u201crapid decarbonization of the American economy on a low-cost, instead of a high-cost, path.\u201d",
      "The new climate law ",
      " for both individuals and businesses. Consumers can get tax credits for buying certain electric vehicles, electric stoves and electric heat pumps, among other goods. Utilities can earn credits by generating electricity from wind or solar farms. And businesses are eligible for tax incentives if they manufacture batteries or solar panels in the United States.",
      "Those tax credits are uncapped, which means that theoretically there is no limit to how many companies and households can ultimately claim them.",

      "\u00a0all the recent announcements for U.S. battery manufacturing and estimated that if they all claimed a new manufacturing tax break, the cost would range from $43.7 billion to $196.5 billion between now and 2032 \u2014 not the $30.6 billion that the Congressional Budget Office initially predicted for that one break alone.",
      "\u201cWhether or not you agree with the policy goals here, I do think we need to be honest about how much this is going to cost,\u201d Ms. McDaniel said. \u201cBecause the budget is only so big, and there are always going to be trade-offs to spending.\u201d",
      "One ",
      " presented at the Brookings Institution used detailed energy modeling to estimate that the law\u2019s climate provisions could cost anywhere from $240 billion to $1.2 trillion over the next decade \u2014 and potentially hundreds of billions of dollars past 2031.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a large amount of uncertainty in how much clean energy is actually going to be deployed,\u201d said John Bistline, program manager at the Electric Power Research Institute and an author of the paper.",
      "Consider, for instance, the provision in the bill that provides a $7,500 tax credit for consumers to buy electric vehicles. In theory, the full credit is available only to electric cars that are assembled in North America and get most of their battery components and critical minerals from either the\u00a0United States or trade allies. But that is a moving target; as automakers and battery manufacturers open new factories in the United States, more cars would qualify.",
      "At the same time, the Treasury Department ",
      " in the tax rules in ways that could expand eligibility for certain cars, drawing criticism from Mr. Manchin, who has pushed for more restrictive rules.",
      "\u201cWhen the law originally passed, I didn\u2019t think any vehicles would qualify for the full credit right off the bat,\u201d said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, an electric vehicle research group. \u201cBut there are already at least 10 that do, and we\u2019re seeing that automakers can be very creative in setting up their supply chains when they have incentive to do so.\u201d",
      "One analysis from Goldman Sachs suggested that electric vehicle provision alone could cost $379 billion more over the next decade than the budget office estimated.",
      "On the flip side, it is also possible that the law ends up being far less potent than many experts are now assuming. Even with tax credits,\u00a0many car buyers might be reluctant to purchase electric vehicles because of a lack of reliable charging stations. Developers of large-scale solar and wind farms could face increasing opposition in communities where they want to build. And, while companies have announced plans for more than $150 billion in clean energy projects so far, some of those investments depend on the Treasury Department to enact favorable rules around certain tax provisions that have yet to be clarified, Mr. Grumet said.",
      "Because of all those variables, the law\u2019s true price tag may not be known for years.",
      "\u201cSo much depends on questions like: Can the permitting process for clean energy projects become easier to navigate? Will there be enough skilled workers and critical minerals available?\u201d said Melissa Lott, research director for the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cThe law is almost certainly going to move the needle on emissions, but the degree to which it does so is still unclear.\u201d"

      ". Usually found growing in relatively poor soil, the plants sprout pitcher-shaped cups with pretty, frilly tops that obscure their true purpose: trapping hapless insects. Look inside the pitchers and you\u2019ll find the half-digested bodies of the plants\u2019 victims.",
      "How do insects wind up in this unenviable situation? Do they just, ",
      ", fall in by accident? While studies suggest that the plants\u2019 colors and its nectar may attract prey, some scientists think pitchers\u2019 scent may play a role as well.",
      "In a study published ",
      ", a research team identified odor molecules emanating from four types of pitcher plants and found that the scents seemed to be correlated with the kinds of insects that wound up in the pitchers. While the study is small and more work is needed to confirm the link, the findings suggest that when insects meet their deaths at the bottom of a pitcher, it may be an aroma they\u2019re following.",
      "Humans tend to describe a pitcher plants\u2019 scent as floral or herbal, said Laurence Gaume, a scientist the French National Centre for Scientific Research and an author of the new paper. Insects may find the scent more striking. ",
      " that pitchers emitting more volatile compounds tended to attract more flies, but rigorous examinations of what exactly pitchers release and whether it\u2019s connected to the insects they attract have been missing.",
      "To answer this question, Dr. Gaume and her colleagues grew four different types of Sarracenia",
      "pitcher plants at their research station in Montpelier, France. They sampled the air above 39 of the pitchers, identifying dozens of volatile compounds, and sliced a number of pitchers open to sort through their contents. They also measured the pitchers\u2019 width and depth, to see whether their shape contributed to the type of prey they caught.",
      "Pitchers with aromas that were heavy on monoterpenes, fragrant substances known to attract pollinators, seemed to catch more moths and bees, the group found, while those emitting more fatty acids ended up with more flies and ants. Pitcher shape, too, was correlated with certain kinds of prey: Longer pitchers were heavier on bees and moths, while shorter pitchers caught more ants.",
      "In other words, it seems unlikely that insects are just falling into a given pitcher by chance, Dr. Gaume said.",
      "Future experiments might probe whether pitcher scents painted onto fake plants draw insects\u2019 attention the same way, or whether altering pitcher color or shape affect the allure of the odors.",
      "Some of the pitcher plants used in Dr. Gaume and colleagues\u2019 research are native to North America \u2014 in fact, they can be found in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Dr. Gaume wonders whether the same connections between scents emitted and prey caught would show up in plants grown outside of the experimental conditions of the study. She has hopes of a much larger study in North America someday to further explore these findings, with row after row of sprightly death traps, all releasing come-hither odors into the air."

      " might make.",
      "But scientists didn\u2019t just affix this device for laughs: They are curious about the underlying brain mechanisms that allow fish to navigate their world, and how such mechanisms relate to the evolutionary roots of navigation for all creatures with brain circuitry.",
      "\u201cNavigation is an extremely important aspect of behavior because we navigate to find food, to find shelter, to escape predators,\u201d said Ronen Segev, a neuroscientist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel who was part of a team that fitted 15 fish with cybernetic headgear for a study ",
      ".",
      "Putting a computer on a goldfish to study how the neurons fire in its brain while navigating wasn\u2019t easy.",
      "It takes a careful hand because a goldfish\u2019s brain, which looks a bit like a small cluster of lentils, is only half an inch long. \u201cUnder a microscope, we exposed the brain and put the electrodes inside,\u201d said Lear Cohen, a neuroscientist and doctoral candidate at Ben-Gurion who performed the surgeries to attach the devices. Each of those electrodes was the diameter of a strand of human hair.",
      "It was also tricky to find a way to perform the procedure on dry land without harming the test subject. \u201cThe fish needs water and you need him not to move,\u201d he said. He and his colleagues solved both problems by pumping water and anesthetics into the fish\u2019s mouth.",
      "Once the electrodes were in the brain, they were connected to a small recording device, which could monitor neuronal activity and which was sealed in a waterproof case, mounted on the fish\u2019s forehead. To keep the computer from weighing the fish down and impeding its ability to swim, the researchers attached buoyant plastic foam to the device.",
      "After recovering from surgery, the fish debuted their headgear in an experiment. The goldfish navigated a two-foot-long, six-inch-wide tank. The closer the fish swam to the tank\u2019s edges, the more the navigational cells in their brains lit up.",
      "The fish\u2019s brain-computer helped reveal that goldfish use a system of navigation that is subtly different from ",
      ". For humans (and other members of our class), navigational cells specialize in pinging our precise location within our environment and building a map around that spot. Mammals have specialized neurons that create these \u201cyou are here\u201d pins in their mental maps; the researchers didn\u2019t find those cells in fish.",
      "Instead, goldfish rely on a type of neuron that fires to let the animal know it is approaching a boundary or an obstacle. By combining the information about how far it is from various barriers, the fish is able to orient itself in space.",
      "The mammalian navigation system, Dr. Segev said, amounts to cells that let an animal determine \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here.\u201d In goldfish, he said, the cells work to impart a different message: \u201cI\u2019m in this position along this axis, and this position along a different axis.\u201d",
      "Mr. Cohen suspects that the variations in animals\u2019 navigation circuits may correspond to the different challenges they face getting around their habitats. For instance, he said, the ever-shifting currents of a watery home could mean that, for fish, \u201cit\u2019s easier to know the distance from a salient feature in the environment than knowing an exact position.\u201d",
      "All of the experiments were approved by the university\u2019s animal welfare committee and the researchers euthanized the fish after their swimming trials so they could further examine their brains. The team hopes to continue learning how and why fish\u2019s navigational systems differ from ours.",
      "Adelaide Sibeaux, a biologist at Oxford University who was not involved with the study, said she found the project \u201cpretty amazing\u201d as well as important.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re modifying a lot of animals\u2019 environments, and, if you understand how an animal navigates, you will know if they are able to cope with changes that are happening in the world at the moment,\u201d Dr. Sibeaux said; for fish, that could include water that becomes murkier because of pollution."

      "In 2011, a gorilla named Zola gained internet fame when the Calgary Zoo posted a video that showed him spinning in circles on his knuckles and heels with what appeared to be a huge grin on his face. Zola, the so-called ",
      ", returned in 2017, this time in a video showing ",
      " a kiddie pool with a level of wild enthusiasm rivaling the most committed human dancer at an all-night rave.",
      "Humans\u2019 love of spinning around in circles, especially during childhood, is evidenced by the enduring popularity of playground merry-go-rounds, revolving fun park rides and the irresistible draw of somersaulting down a hill. But new research suggests that humans are not alone in their pursuit of spin-induced buzzes.",
      "According to findings ",
      ", other great ape species also seem to regularly enjoy stimulating their senses through spinning, possibly even in pursuit of altered mental states.",
      "\u201cSpinning around to make ourselves dizzy is something we usually think of as a distinctly human activity,\u201d said Marcus Perlman, a cognitive scientist at the University of Birmingham in England and an author of the study. \u201cSo it\u2019s really cool to find that other primates do this, too, and that they seem to do it for the same reason that children do: because it\u2019s fun and exhilarating.\u201d",
      "After Dr. Perlman saw the videos of Zola, he turned to YouTube to investigate whether other apes engaged in the behavior. He amassed nearly 400 videos showing great apes and other primates engaged in spinning behaviors, including somersaulting, rolling down hills, backflipping and pirouetting. But the new paper focuses on clips of apes spinning on ropes or ropelike materials.",
      "Dr. Perlman and Adriano Lameira, a primatologist and evolutionary psychologist at the University of Warwick in England, found 132 instances of rope-spinning across 40 videos involving orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. The videos mostly featured captive apes, but several involved wild mountain gorillas on vines.",
      "The researchers calculated the speed at which the apes spun. Most of the apes, they found, spun at an average rotation velocity of 1.43 revolutions per second \u2014 a speed rivaling professionally trained human dancers and aerialists. The longest spin session lasted 28 revolutions, and the fastest \u2014 achieved by a bonobo \u2014 clocked in at a brain-scrambling four revolutions per second.",
      "The researchers observed that the longer an ape spun, the more likely it was to show signs of dizziness, such as letting go of the rope and immediately sitting or lying down. Apes tended to repeat the process of spinning and stopping, engaging in an average of three bouts of spinning per session.",
      "The animals also often made \u201cplay faces\u201d while spinning, Dr. Perlman said, implying that they were most likely having fun rather than only seeking a way to relieve themselves of boredom in captivity.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the experience they enjoy,\u201d Dr. Perlman said.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who was not involved in the research, concurred. Based on her observations in the field, she said, \u201cwild apes love to spin.\u201d",
      "Apes and some other animals are known to engage in other activities that can scramble the senses, including consuming fermented fruits containing ",
      " and ingesting naturally occurring ",
      ". Whether this is done on purpose or by accident is debated, Dr. Perlman said. But studies such as this one can begin to provide data needed to explore behaviors that may be evolutionary precursors to the human desire to experience altered mental states.",
      "Dr. Perlman is planning a larger study that will analyze hundreds of additional videos of nonhuman primates spinning. He has also started collecting evidence of other species, including ",

      "Moths and other insects are drawn to lights at night as reliably as planets orbit stars.",
      "Entomologists have long exploited this fact by setting out light traps whenever they want to collect insects. Poets have reached for the image of a moth drawn to flame to signify self-destructive behavior in works ranging from \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d",
      "to the Hindu epic the Bhagavad Gita",
      "Ecologists, more recently, ",
      " that the lure of artificial lights across Earth\u2019s nighttime surface may partially explain why insects are in global decline.",
      "But, despite all this, scientists still didn\u2019t know why.",
      "\u201cA lot of entomologists get asked this all the time,\u201d Avalon Owens, a biologist at Harvard, said.",
      "One prevailing theory, popular but flawed, she said, is that flying insects confuse our porch lights for the moon or another celestial body, and their sense of navigation gets scrambled. Another idea is that lights at night look like glimpses of daylight through a thicket of vegetation, prompting insects to try to \u201cescape\u201d by making a beeline toward what they think is open space.",
      "Now, though, ",
      " has the entomology world abuzz. A team led by biologists Samuel Fabian at Imperial College London and Yash Sondhi at Florida International University argue that when many insects see a bright light at night, they believe they\u2019ve found the direction of the sky and attempt to orient themselves along an up-and-down axis. That instinct prompts them to roll their backs toward the light, mistakenly in cases when the source of illumination is on the ground or mounted horizontally, causing them to go into endless, banking turns like a tiny airplane or to crash-land.",
      "The findings were published in a paper that was uploaded to the bioRxiv server but has yet to be peer-reviewed.",
      "In the daytime, entomologists knew, such directional instincts help flying insects stay level by keeping their backs pointed toward sunlight, even during aerial maneuvers. The new analysis, though, shows that lights at night appear to hijack this instinct.",
      "To arrive at this conclusion, the scientists took high-speed, lowlight video of dragonflies, butterflies and moths flying around light bulbs both in the lab and in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. Sometimes the insects would start making circular loops like an orbiting moon. Other times the insects would pass the bulbs, then tilt upward into a stall. Or they would fly above the bulbs, then flip themselves upside down and nose-dive toward the ground.",
      "In each case, though, the slowed-down footage showed that the insects always tried to keep their backs aimed toward the light, a result the team confirmed by gluing little motion trackers on the insects. In turn, the team found through computerized flight simulations that those inadvertent roll maneuvers could explain the bugs\u2019 looping, trapped flight trajectories.",
      "\u201cThis is the best argument so far for what explains this behavior,\u201d said Tyson Hedrick, an expert in the aerodynamics of insect flight at the University of North Carolina who said he had previously favored the idea that lights interfere with the celestial navigation of insects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of these things that we all sort of think we know about nature,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s getting overturned.\u201d",
      "The new study also offers a hint of how to mitigate the effect, which can kill insects in ways that are poetic \u2014 burning up in flame \u2014 or more sinister, like getting trapped in the web of a spider that has learned artificial lights provide prey. Some insects also simply run out of calories by flying in circles.",
      "The research team found that insects seem least affected when they fly under lights that are projected straight down, as opposed to lights that shine upward or that have been mounted horizontally. This finding dovetails with longstanding advice from researchers to limit light pollution by using downward pointing light fixtures that illuminate only the nearby ground.",
      "Aside from beckoning insects, lights can also interfere with the development of caterpillars, cause fireflies to stop flashing, and shrink the habitat of shyer nocturnal species that venture out only in pure darkness, Dr. Owens said.",
      "\u201cThe most effective way of solving this problem is always going to be turning off the lights,\u201d she said."

      "On warm evenings near Rio de Janeiro, you might find milk fruit trees covered in brownish-orange frogs. While many frogs eat insects, the tree frog species Xenohyla truncata has a taste for the pulp of bulbous fruits and the nectar in the tree\u2019s flowers.",
      "As they seek that nectar, the frogs dunk their entire bodies into the plant\u2019s flowers, only their butts sticking out. When they emerge, pollen gets stuck to their heads and backs. Then they hop off, potentially transporting the pollen from their previous stop at the tropical buffet into the next milk fruit flower they encounter.",
      "In other words, the frogs may disperse the plant\u2019s seeds and pollinate its flowers \u2014 which would be the first time this has been seen in an amphibian.",

      "Because one of the frogs surfaced from its flowery snack clad in pollen, Dr. Toledo said, the team hypothesized that it was \u201cactually very likely\u201d that the species aids milk fruit tree pollination \u2014 accidentally taking pollen from flower to flower and causing reproduction \u2014 something amphibians weren\u2019t thought to perform. This could also happen with other flowers of similar shapes. In fact, recordings the team made that night show frogs also slurping on nectar from alien bearded irises.",

      "For instance, the mucus secreted by the frog\u2019s skin needs to be tested to confirm it doesn\u2019t spoil the pollen before it gets to its destination. Scientists also need to work out whether the pollen is ever delivered to other flowers and if it does successfully fertilize and germinate them. It\u2019s also still unclear why this frog species has developed a liking for flora over fauna in the first place.",

      "On any given night, far from bright city lights, there\u2019s a chance that you\u2019ll see a beautiful streak shoot across the sky as a meteor flies overhead. But on special dates scattered throughout the year, skywatchers can catch a multitude of flares as meteor showers burst in the darkness.",
      "Meteor showers occur when our planet runs into the debris fields left behind by icy comets or rocky asteroids going around the sun. These small particles burn up in the atmosphere, leading to blazing trails of light. The regularity of orbital mechanics means that any given meteor shower happens at roughly the same time each year, with the changing phases of the bright moon being the main variable affecting their visibility.",
      "The next event is the Eta Aquariids, one of two showers resulting from the debris field of Halley\u2019s comet (the other is the ",
      "). Debris will enter over Earth\u2019s Equator, meaning it will be visible in both hemispheres all over the world. In past years, the Eta Aquariids have produced 45 to 85 meteors per hour in dark sky conditions.",
      "Unfortunately, the peak for this shower coincides with a full moon on Friday, May 5, into Saturday, May 6, limiting visibility. But the shower should be highly active for roughly a week before and after that date.",
      " to get a reminder ahead of this and other events.",
      "The best practice is to head out to the countryside and get as far from artificial light sources as possible. People in rural areas may have the luxury of just stepping outside. But city-dwellers have options, too.",
      "Many cities have an astronomical society that maintains a dedicated dark sky area. \u201cI would suggest contacting them and finding out where they have their location,\u201d Robert Lunsford, the secretary general of the International Meteor Organization, said in an interview with The New York Times in 2022.",
      "Meteor showers are usually best viewed when the sky is darkest, after midnight but before sunrise. To see as many meteors as possible, wait 30 to 45 minutes after you get to your viewing location. That will allow your eyes to adjust to the dark. Then lie back and take in a large swath of the night sky. Clear nights, higher altitudes and times when the moon is slim or absent are best. Mr. Lunsford suggested a good rule of thumb: \u201cThe more stars you can see, the more meteors you can see.\u201d",
      "Binoculars or telescopes aren\u2019t necessary for meteor showers, and in fact will limit your view.",
      "Each shower peaks on a certain date when Earth is plowing into the densest portion of the debris field, though in some cases many meteors can still be seen before or after that specific night.",
      "A shower is named for a constellation in the part of the sky it appears to streak from. But there\u2019s no need to be perfectly versed in every detail of the celestial sphere. Meteors should be visible all over the sky during any given shower."

      "Earlier this year, astronomers announced that a tiny world beyond Neptune with a diameter about one-third that of Earth\u2019s moon possessed a Saturn-like ring that should not be there. It now turns out that there are two such \u201cimpossible\u201d rings.",
      "\u201cIt was a big surprise,\u201d said Chrystian Luciano Pereira, a doctoral student at the National Observatory in Brazil who led the observations of the world, known as Quaoar. \u201cThis implies that Quaoar is a more complex system than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The new ring, about six miles wide, encircles Quaoar at a distance of about 1,500 miles. The discovery ",

      "Scientists still do not fully understand how dust and gas in the early solar system coalesced into moons and planets.",
      "Like the ",
      ", announced by a team of astronomers in February, the second ring lies beyond what is known as the Roche limit. Material orbiting closer than this distance tends to be pulled apart by tidal forces. Thus, a ring within the Roche limit would tend to remain a ring, while a ring of debris outside the Roche limit would usually coalesce into a moon.",
      "For Quaoar, the Roche limit is calculated to be 1,100 miles. The second ring, at a distance of 1,500 miles from the center of Quaoar, is closer than the ring announced in February, which has a radius of about 2,500 miles.",
      "Quaoar (pronounced KWA-wahr, and the name of the creator god for the Indigenous Tongva people who live around Los Angeles) orbits the sun in the ",
      " a region of frozen debris beyond Neptune that includes Pluto.",
      "The ring is not visible in telescope images. Rather, astronomers found it indirectly, when distant stars happened to pass behind Quaoar, blocking the starlight. From 2018 to 2021, Quaoar passed in front of four stars, and astronomers on Earth were able to observe the shadow of the eclipses, also known as stellar occultations.",
      "They also observed some dimming of the starlight before and after the star blinked out, which pointed to the existence of the first ring.",
      "Another occultation occurred on Aug. 9 last year, and astronomers again pointed telescopes, large and small, at Quaoar in hopes of learning more about the ring.",
      "The new observations revealed more details including a dense, narrow core in the ring just a few miles wide, which is surrounded by an envelope of material that is more dispersed. The observations also revealed the second ring.",
      "Another occultation will occur on May 13, visible to telescopes in the United States and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis event involves a bright star and will be useful to constrain the Quaoar shape better, in addition to being a good opportunity to obtain more details about these two remarkable rings,\u201d Mr. Pereira said.",
      "A potential explanation for Quaoar\u2019s distant rings is the presence of a moon, Weywot. The moon may have created gravitational disturbances that prevented the ring\u2019s particles from accreting into additional moons. Both rings occur in locations near what are known as resonances with Weywot, and the resonances may turn out to be more important than the Roche limit for determining whether rings turn into moons or remain as rings."

      "Down the drain is where British archaeologists recently discovered 36 artfully engraved semiprecious stones, in an ancient bathhouse at the site of a Roman fort near Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Carlisle, England. The colorful intaglios \u2014 gems with incised carvings \u2014 likely fell out of signet rings worn by wealthy third-century bathers, and ended up trapped in the stone drains.",
      "The delicate intaglios, fashioned from amethyst, jasper and carnelian, range in diameter from 5 millimeters to 16 millimeters \u2014 bigger than a pencil eraser, smaller than a dime. Some bear images of Apollo, Mars, Bonus Eventus and other Roman deities symbolizing war or good fortune. Others showcase Ceres, the god of fertility, Sol (the sun) and Mercury (commerce). One amethyst depicts Venus holding either a flower or a mirror. A reddish-brown jasper features a satyr seated on rocks beside a pillar.",
      "How and why these stones were lost is a subject of some debate among classicists. After six years of archaeological detective work that has provided a tantalizing glimpse of Roman Britain, Frank Giecco, the technical director of the Carlisle project, believes that he and his team have solved the mystery.",
      "Historically, two kinds of engraved gems were worn mounted on finger rings: intaglios, which have designs cut as a depression into the surface of the gem; and cameos, with designs that project from the background, a raised image in relief.",
      "The tradition of intaglios goes back to the Sumerian period in Mesopotamia, where figures were gouged by hand into softer stone. From about 3400 B.C., stamp seals and cylinder seals were pressed and imprinted into damp clay. These became popular in Minoan and Mycenaean Greece, Persia, Egypt and Rome, where they became objects of fashion; the statesman Cicero observed that people wore portraits of their favorite philosophers on their rings, a tradition that has not survived on today\u2019s QVC Network.",
      "The excavation at the Carlisle Cricket Club began in 2017 and quickly revealed a bathhouse that \u201cwas truly colossal in scale,\u201d Mr. Giecco said.",
      "The bathhouse was built along the river Eden and near the Roman fort of Uxelodunum, also known as Petriana, which was safely situated behind Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the empire\u2019s northern border. Hadrian, the Roman emperor, ordered the wall built in 122 A.D. to ward off Caledonian tribes. At Uxelodunum \u2014 today a thriving suburb \u2014 were stationed the Ala Petriana, a large and elite cavalry regiment. A major civilian settlement \u2014 eventually Luguvalium, or Roman Carlisle \u2014 grew up to the immediate south.",
      "The main building of the bathhouse, constructed around 210 A.D., had sandstone walls three-and-a-half feet thick. The baths were rebuilt in the fourth century and were still in use in the fifth; some parts were subsequently rebuilt in timber and may still have been standing in the 12th century, when the site was quarried for building materials. The region remained strategic. \u201cWe have found evidence of the 1645 and 1745 sieges of Carlisle during the English Civil War and Jacobite Rebellion,\u201d Mr. Giecco said. In the early 20th century the site was turned into tennis courts.",
      "Upon entering the bathhouse in the third century, your first stop was the apodyterium, or changing room, where you removed everything but your bath sandals, needed to protect your feet from the heated floors. Prosperous patrons had slaves to guard their belongings; poorer bathers paid the attendants. Some may have held onto their baubles in the pools to prevent the valuables from being stolen. \u201cBathers knew the risk of gems falling out,\u201d Mr. Giecco said. \u201cBut theft from the lockers was so great that they kept valuables with them regardless.\u201d",
      "If a thief made off with your jewelry, you might call on the gods for justice, by means of a curse tablet: a priest would scrawl a message, sometimes backward or in code, on a slab of lead or other metal, then cast it into the mineral waters. In 1979 and 1980, a large haul of curse tablets was recovered from the hot springs of Aquae Sulis \u2014 now Bath, England \u2014 many of them listing the wrongdoing, the alleged wrongdoers and a suggested punishment. \u201cMay he who carried off Vilbia from me be as liquid as the water,\u201d one curse reads.",
      "The Carlisle gems were found along with more than 700 items, including 105 glass beads, pottery, weapons, coins, clay figures, animal bones, tiles stamped with the imperial mark and some 100 hairpins. Similar discoveries have been made during the excavation of bathhouses in Caesarea, Israel, and in Bath.",
      "The presence of hairpins suggest that the gems\u2019 owners were probably female, Mr. Giecco said. And dips into bathhouse water may have loosened jewelry adhesives, such as birch bark resin, and caused metal settings to expand and contract. In the steamy environment, the Roman elite may have emerged from their leisurely baths unadorned. The stones were likely flushed into the drains when the pools and saunas were cleaned.",
      "\u201cThe bathers may not have even noticed until they got home, because it\u2019s the actual stone falling out of the rings,\u201d Mr. Giecco said."

      "On Monday, scientists from the University of Texas, Austin, made another step in that direction. In a study published\u00a0",
      ", the researchers described an A.I. that could translate the private thoughts of human subjects by analyzing fMRI scans,\u00a0which measure the flow of blood to different regions in the brain.",
      "Already, researchers have developed language-decoding methods to ",
      " of people who have lost the ability to speak, and to allow ",
      " while just thinking of writing. But the new language decoder is one of the first to not rely on implants. In the study, it was able to turn a person\u2019s imagined speech into actual speech and, when subjects were shown silent films, it could generate relatively accurate descriptions of what was happening onscreen.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a language stimulus,\u201d said Alexander Huth, a neuroscientist at the university who helped lead the research. \u201cWe\u2019re getting at meaning, something about the idea of what\u2019s happening. And the fact that that\u2019s possible is very exciting.\u201d",
      "The study centered on three participants, who came to Dr. Huth\u2019s lab for 16 hours over several days to listen to \u201cThe Moth\u201d and other narrative podcasts. As they listened, an fMRI scanner recorded the blood oxygenation levels in parts of their brains. The researchers then used a large language model to match patterns in the brain activity to the words and phrases that the participants had heard.",
      "Large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Bard are trained on vast amounts of writing to predict the next word in a sentence or phrase. In the process, the models create maps indicating how words relate to one another. A few years ago, Dr. Huth ",
      " that particular pieces of these maps \u2014 so-called context embeddings, which capture the semantic features, or meanings, of phrases \u2014 could be used to predict how the brain lights up in response to language.",
      "In a basic sense, said Shinji Nishimoto, a neuroscientist at Osaka University who was not involved in the research, \u201cbrain activity is a kind of encrypted signal, and language models provide ways to decipher it.\u201d",
      "In their study, Dr. Huth and his colleagues effectively reversed the process, using another A.I. to translate the participant\u2019s fMRI images into words and phrases. The researchers tested the decoder by having the participants listen to new recordings, then seeing how closely the translation matched the actual transcript.",
      "Almost every word was out of place in the decoded script, but the meaning of the passage was regularly preserved. Essentially, the decoders were paraphrasing.",
      ": \u201cI got up from the air mattress and pressed my face against the glass of the bedroom window expecting to see eyes staring back at me but instead only finding darkness.\u201d",
      " \u201cI just continued to walk up to the window and open the glass I stood on my toes and peered out I didn\u2019t see anything and looked up again I saw nothing.\u201d",
      "While under the fMRI scan, the participants were also asked to silently imagine telling a story; afterward, they repeated the story aloud, for reference. Here, too, the decoding model captured the gist of the unspoken version.",
      ": \u201cLook for a message from my wife saying that she had changed her mind and that she was coming back.\u201d",
      ": \u201cTo see her for some reason I thought she would come to me and say she misses me.\u201d",
      "Finally the subjects watched a brief, silent animated movie, again while undergoing an fMRI scan. By analyzing their brain activity, the language model could decode a rough synopsis of what they were viewing \u2014 maybe their internal description of what they were viewing.",
      "The result suggests that the A.I. decoder was capturing not just words but also meaning. \u201cLanguage perception is an externally driven process, while imagination is an active internal process,\u201d Dr. Nishimoto said. \u201cAnd the authors showed that the brain uses common representations across these processes.\u201d",
      "Greta Tuckute, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research, said that was \u201cthe high-level question.\u201d",
      "\u201cCan we decode meaning from the brain?\u201d she continued. \u201cIn some ways they show that, yes, we can.\u201d",
      "This language-decoding method had limitations, Dr. Huth and his colleagues noted. For one, fMRI scanners are bulky and expensive. Moreover, training the model is a long, tedious process, and to be effective it must be done on individuals. When the researchers tried to use a decoder trained on one person to read the brain activity of another, it failed, suggesting that every brain has unique ways of representing meaning.",
      "Participants were also able to shield their internal monologues, throwing off the decoder by thinking of other things. A.I. might be able to read our minds, but for now it will have to read them one at a time, and with our permission."

      "While millions of eyes are on the coronation of Charles III this weekend, other male monarchs will carry on ruling in obscurity \u2014 literal obscurity, because they live in darkness underground, or maybe in a piece of rotting wood.",
      "Queens are familiar figures among insect species. But it is only in termites that royal families include kings. Long-lived, ensconced in fortified royal chambers and faithful to their enormous queens, these rulers are unique in the insect realm.",
      "\u201cThere are some parallels to our monarchy system for humans,\u201d said Barbara Thorne, a termite biologist and professor emerita at the University of Maryland.",
      "Termites, like many ant, bee and wasp species, live in collaboratives of sterile workers. But there are crucial differences.",
      "In the nests of ants, bees or wasps, the sole monarch is a queen. She stores all the sperm she will need for the rest of her life after a single, eventful mating flight. She uses the stored sperm to produce daughters, who take on all the work of finding food and caring for their younger siblings.",
      "Termites evolved separately from these other insects, and they do things their own way. For starters, both a queen and a king are needed to start a termite colony. The reason isn\u2019t romantic: Female termites can\u2019t store sperm, so they need a male to inseminate them over and over. A study of one species found that it happened ",
      ".",
      "King and queen work together to get their family started. The male \u201chelps with every aspect of it,\u201d Dr. Thorne said, \u201cfrom the brood care to nurturing, feeding, providing water, attending his queen.\u201d",
      "Soon, though, the royal couple steps back. They keep making babies, but let grown offspring handle the forage and child care. Those helpful kids are both male and female, a society of brothers and sisters working together. Some also grow up to become soldiers specially built for defending their colonies.",
      "The queen and king don\u2019t set themselves apart with crowns or other regalia, but they do start out in adulthood with wings, which they shed as they\u2019re settling down. The queen becomes \u201cginormous, just a big sac of ovaries, basically,\u201d said Ed Vargo, an entomologist at Texas A&M University. The king, while dwarfed by his bride, is still larger than the workers, and usually the soldiers.",
      "Termites can\u2019t see those differences, as they live in the dark. But Dr. Vargo\u2019s lab has shown that workers and soldiers can recognize their sovereigns ",
      ". When another termite is near a queen or a king, it shakes its body, perhaps alerting others that they\u2019re in the presence of royalty.",
      "And although they don\u2019t have a castle, Dr. Thorne said, \u201cThey do have a special royal cell with a little chamber that\u2019s primarily the queen and king.\u201d Deep within the nest and with thicker walls, this chamber protects the queen and the king if, say, an anteater takes a swipe.",
      "As the royals don\u2019t leave their chamber, workers give them regurgitated food from their own mouths. Other colony-living insects spike their mouth-to-mouth meals with chemicals for communication, Dr. Vargo said. It\u2019s possible that termites do the same thing. For now, though, the makeup of these termite meals is as mysterious as the \u201csecret mixture of oils\u201d with which Charles III will be anointed, using the centuries-old ",
      ".",
      "The termite king, performing his marital duties, helps his mate produce as many as ",
      " each day. When the king or the queen eventually dies, a replacement will come from among these heirs and many, many spares. \u201cThe reproductive throne is inherited by one or more of their offspring,\u201d Dr. Thorne said.",
      "In rags-to-riches style, the first termites evolved from cockroaches. Why they became so cooperative is a bit of a puzzle. Ants, bees and wasps have a genetic system that makes the females in a family more closely related than usual; this may be part of why queen-led colonies evolved several times in these insects. But a termite colony is no more related than a human family (at least until the inbreeding starts). Whatever led them to evolve coed, cooperative societies, Dr. Vargo said, it happened only once in history.",
      "Today they have expanded into about 2,600 highly cooperative species. \u201cTermites are amazing, and super important in their native habitats for decomposition and recycling of nutrients,\u201d Dr. Thorne said. But our interactions with those societies are mostly negative since, she said, \u201cWe build our houses out of termite food.\u201d",
      "The termite monarchy also offers a window into the science of longevity. Like ant, bee or wasp queens, termite royals can live substantially longer than their subjects. Workers may live a few months, while termite royals have survived 20 years in laboratories.",
      "Eisuke Tasaki, a biologist at Niigata University in Japan, said termite kings have a distinctive set of molecular tools that slow their aging, such as more active genes for ",
      "\u201cUnraveling the molecular mechanisms of termite king longevity may shed light on the mysteries of life span regulation in male individuals\u201d in all animals, Dr. Tasaki said.",
      "Long live the king, indeed!"

      "The End is coming, in maybe 100 billion years. Is it too soon to start freaking out?",
      "\u201cThere will be a last sentient being, there will be a last thought,\u201d declared Janna Levin, a cosmologist at Barnard College, near the end of \u201cA Trip to Infinity,\u201d a new Neflix documentary directed by Jonathan Halperin and Drew Takahashi.",
      "When I heard that statement during a showing of the film recently, it broke my heart. It was the saddest, loneliest idea I had ever contemplated. I thought I was aware and knowledgeable about our shared cosmic predicament \u2014 namely, that if what we think we know about physics and cosmology is true, life and intelligence are doomed. I thought I had made some kind of intellectual peace with that.",
      "But this was an angle that I hadn\u2019t thought of before. At some point in the future there will be somewhere in the universe where there will be a last sentient being. And a last thought. And that last word, no matter how profound or mundane, will vanish into silence along with the memory of Einstein and Elvis, Jesus, Buddha, Aretha and Eve, while the remaining bits of the physical universe go on sailing apart for billions upon billions upon billions of lonely, silent years.",
      "Will that last thought be a profound pearl of wisdom? An expletive?",
      "How did we humans get into this fix? The universe as we know it originated in a fiery burst 13.8 billion years ago and has been flying apart ever since. Astronomers argued for decades about whether it would go on expanding forever or someday collapse again into a \u201cbig crunch.\u201d",
      "All that changed in 1998 when astronomers discovered that the cosmic expansion was speeding up, boosted by an anti-gravitational force that is part of the fabric of spacetime. The bigger the universe gets, the harder this \u201cdark energy\u201d pushes it apart. This new force bears a striking resemblance to the cosmological constant, a cosmic repulsion Einstein had proposed as a fudge factor in his equations as a way of explaining why the universe did not collapse, but later rejected as a blunder.",
      "But the cosmological constant ",
      ". And now it threatens to wreck physics and the universe.",
      "In the end, if this dark energy prevails, distant galaxies will eventually be speeding away so fast that we can\u2019t see them anymore. The more time goes on, the less we will know about the universe. The stars will die and not be reborn. It will be like living inside an inside-out black hole, sucking matter, energy and information over the horizon, never to return.",
      "Worse, because thinking takes energy, eventually there will not be enough energy in the universe to hold a thought. In the end there will only be subatomic particles dancing intergalactic distances away from each other in a dark silence, trillions upon trillions of years after there was any light or life in the universe. And then, more uncountable trillions of eons to come, until there is finally no way to count the years, as Brian Greene, the popular Columbia University theorist and author, so elegantly and devastatingly described it in his recent book, \u201cUntil the End of Time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard not to want to scream at our own insignificance in all of this. If this is, in fact, what the universe will come to. The universe as we know it is now 14 billion years old, which seems like a long time but is only an infinitesimal sliver of the trillions and quadrillions of years of darkness to come. It will mean that everything interesting in our universe happened in a brief flash, at the very beginning. A promising start, and then an eternal abyss. The finality and futility of it all!",
      "In short, a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. What do we do with a universe like this?",
      "You may point out that it is way too soon to be prescribing a future for the universe. New discoveries in physics could provide an escape hatch. Maybe dark energy will not be constant; maybe it will turn around and recompress the universe. In an email, Michael Turner, the cosmologist emeritus formerly at the University of Chicago who coined the term dark energy, referring to the Greek letter symbolizing Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant said, \u201cLambda would be the most uninteresting answer to the dark energy puzzle!\u201d",
      "But for now, that is ",
      ".",
      "Our goose will be cooked a billion or so years from now, when the Sun boils away the oceans. A few billion years later the Sun itself will die, burning Earth and anything that remains of us to a crisp.",
      "There is no escaping to space. The galaxies themselves will collapse into black holes in about 10^30 years.",
      "And black holes will finally release all that they have imprisoned as a thin spray of particles and radiation, to be scattered into the prevailing wind of dark energy whisking them apart.",
      "In some variations on the story, known as the Big Rip, dark energy could eventually grow strong enough to tear apart the tombstones that mark your grave.",
      "And so, just as there was a first living creature somewhere, sometime, to emerge from the splendid blaze of the Big Bang, there will be a last creature to die, a last thought. A last sentient being, as Dr. Levin pointed out.",
      "That idea is what stopped me short. It had never occurred to me that some individual being would have the last word on existence, the last chance to curse or be grateful. Part of the pain is that nobody will know who, or what, had the last word, or what was thought or said. Somehow that notion made cosmic extinction more personal, and I wondered what it would be like.",
      "Maybe as all the energy dwindles away over the horizon it will be like falling asleep. Or like Einstein mumbling his last words in German to a nurse who didn\u2019t know the language. Or the computer at the end of time in Isaac Asimov\u2019s classic story ",
      " finally figuring out the secret of the universe and declaring, \u201cLet there be light.\u201d Might it be some blazing realization about the nature of string theory or the final secret about black holes? I hate to miss out on it.",
      "I\u2019d like to think my last thought would be one of love or gratitude or awe or about the face of a loved one, but I worry it would be an expletive.",
      "Wiser people than me ask, when I go on about this, why I don\u2019t whine about the billions of years that passed before I was born? Perhaps it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know what I was missing, whereas now I\u2019ve had a lifetime to imagine what I\u2019ll miss.",
      "If that worries you, here is an encouraging metaphor straight from Einstein\u2019s equations: When you are inside a black hole, light pours in from the outside universe, which seems to speed up while you appear to be frozen. In principle, you could see the whole future history of the galaxy or even the whole universe speed past you as you fall toward the center, the singularity where space and time stop, and you die.",
      "Maybe death could be like that, a revelation of all of the past and future.",
      "In a sense, when we die the future dies too.",
      "Rather than whine about the end of time, most of the physicists and astronomers I talk to say the notion is a relief. The death of the future frees them to concentrate on the magic of the moment.",
      "The late, great astrophysicist, philosopher and black hole evangelist John Archibald Wheeler, of Princeton, used to say that the past and the future are fiction, that they only exist in the artifacts and the imaginations of the present.",
      "According to that point of view, the universe ends with me, and so in a sense I do have the final word.",
      "\u201cNothing lasts forever\u201d is a maxim that applies to the stock market and the stars as well as to our lives and Buddhist sand paintings. A whiff of eternity can illuminate an entire lifetime, perhaps even mine.",
      "No matter what happens in the endless eons to come, at least we were here for the party, for the brief shining sliver of eternity when the universe teemed with life and light.",
      "We\u2019ll always have the Milky Way."

It\u2019s not a fluke, scientists say, but part of a trend that will allow a wider swath of the world to get a rare glimpse of the phenomenon for the next few years.",

In fact, Dr. De was using the Zwicky Transient Facility, a camera on a telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California, in May 2020 to look for something completely different \u2014 merging stars, called red novas. It was in those observations that he stumbled across a curious burst of visible light.",
      "What unfolded was like a \u201cdetective story,\u201d Dr. De said. To identify the burst, his team obtained visible-light observations of the source captured in November 2020 by the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Those images revealed a star chilling at about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, about 10 times colder than the searing temperatures expected from red novas.",
      "Puzzled, Dr. De and his colleagues observed the star again, this time in infrared light, using another camera at the Palomar Observatory and NASA\u2019s NEOWISE space telescope. The system turned out to be brilliant in infrared, a band of the light spectrum that is ideal for spotting faint objects that don\u2019t emit much energy. It dawned on the researchers that they were most likely watching a star gulping down a planet in real time.",
      "\u201cMy first reaction was disbelief,\u201d Dr. De said. \u201cWe see the before and the after\u201d of planetary engulfment, he added, but \u201cthese observations give us the first glimpse into how that process plays out.\u201d",
      "The initial burst detected by the Zwicky observatory, which lasted 10 days, occurred at the moment that a dying star at last fully enveloped a gas planet no more than 10 times the mass of Jupiter. For more than a year before its luminous demise, the planet skimmed the outskirts of the star, pulling off chunks of its atmosphere, which explains why the researchers saw cool gas and dust hanging around the system. After the burst, the star eerily glowed for about six months as it swallowed the remains of the planet.",
      "Lorenzo Spina, an astrophysicist at the Astronomical Observatory of Padua in Italy who studies planetary engulfment, called the team\u2019s conclusions \u201cvery solid\u201d and described the discovery as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a very important missing piece of the entire story,\u201d Dr. Spina said. \u201cNow, we are going to have a more complete understanding of this entire process.\u201d",
      "Such incredible events can shed light on a host of juicy mysteries, including the odds that life might exist elsewhere in the universe. Starlight that contains chemical hints of planetary morsels can be mined for clues about the interior composition of worlds in other systems. Building an inventory of these ingredients can help to estimate the number of star systems with the right materials to support habitable environments.",
      "Now that scientists have seen a real example of planetary engulfment, they can search the skies for similar patterns that fit the blueprint. The new observations also provide a grisly sneak peek of the literal end of the world. When the sun enters its red-giant phase, our familiar home planet is likely to die within its infernal embrace.",
      "\u201cFinding an event like this really puts all of the theories that have been out there to the most stringent tests possible,\u201d Dr. De said. \u201cIt really opens up this entire new field of research.\u201d"

      "On an overcast day, before a few dozen people at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, a team of players wearing light blue uniforms battles a team in dark blue across six courts.",
      "This is where a college tennis team has the greatest moment in its history. And where it goes to die.",
      "For the first time, the men\u2019s team from St. Francis of Brooklyn was playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament. But after the first-round match was over on Friday, and St. Francis had fallen, 4-0, to Columbia, the program was no more. St. Francis is dropping all of its sports at the end of the school year for budgetary reasons.",
      "Chad Davis played at St. Francis and has been the men\u2019s tennis coach for 19 years. \u201cBeing an alum of the college, being there for so long and seeing the program grow year after year and battle after battle, it\u2019s definitely a bitter pill to swallow,\u201d he said.",
      "Making the tournament seemed unlikely after St. Francis got off to a 1-10 start this season, including a loss in its first conference game. \u201cIt was definitely difficult in the beginning; we weren\u2019t clicking,\u201d Davis said.",
      "Then in March came the news that the college\u2019s athletic programs were being shut down. The school cited \u201cincreased operating expenses, flattening revenue streams, and plateauing enrollment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was very surprising,\u201d said one of the players, Luis Foix Sotos, from J\u00e1vea, Spain. \u201cWhen I saw the athletic director, her voice was very sad. I said, \u2018Something is going on here.\u2019 When she said the news, some people were crying. It was a very sad moment.\u201d",
      "Davis said, \u201cJust to hear it, it was definitely a gut punch.\u201d Yet the news, the coach said, oddly seemed to rally the team. \u201cThe guys kind of came together, and we strung together some nice wins.\u201d",
      "The team won seven of its last eight games, including all of its remaining conference games. But it needed to win the Northeast Conference tournament to qualify for the N.C.A.A. tournament. In the final, it met Fairleigh Dickinson, which had eliminated it the previous two years.",
      "Foix Sotos was the player who won the clinching match in a 4-2 victory. \u201cIt was the best feeling ever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of the happiest moments of my life. For me, it was epic; it was like a movie that ended in the best way possible.\u201d",
      "In the N.C.A.A. tournament against Columbia, St. Francis was a big underdog; with a 19-3 record, Columbia had achieved the highest ranking in its history, at No. 13 nationally. The match took place in front of mostly friends and family, a far cry from when the Billie Jean King Center is overstuffed with fans paying $24 for chicken tenders at the U.S. Open.",
      "St. Francis was hampered further by being short-handed, in part because some players were unable to cancel travel plans they had made when a trip to the tournament seemed unlikely. Foix Sotos, for example, played fourth singles, rather than his usual sixth. And Davis also had to miss the match with a health problem.",
      "Columbia made quick work of the opening doubles matches, and the singles matches were no closer. When Columbia won its clinching third singles match, the others were halted, and St. Francis\u2019s final season was done.",
      "St. Francis was one of the smallest schools with Division I athletics.",
      "The men\u2019s basketball team was one of just four original members of Division I never to make the N.C.A.A. tournament. But the men\u2019s water polo team made multiple Final Four trips, most recently in 2013, and the city skyline backdrop to its soccer games in Brooklyn Bridge Park regularly made visiting players clamor for selfies.",
      "The men\u2019s and women\u2019s track teams are the last still going, but in a few weeks their final seasons, too, will be over.",
      "St. Francis has said it will honor the athletic scholarships of the players with eligibility remaining. \u201cSome of the older players are planning to stay in New York,\u201d said Foix Sotos, whose own eligibility is exhausted. \u201cThey have a life here, and they don\u2019t want to transfer for only one year. But for the freshmen and the sophomores, they all want to transfer; they are looking for schools.\u201d",
      "Athletic officials said they were getting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s together. Does Davis have any plans after two decades at the school? \u201cAt the moment, no I do not.\u201d",
      "When the match was over on Friday, the team gathered in a circle by one of the nets, arms linked, and shared a private moment.",
      "\u201cWe were just saying thank you,\u201d Foix Sotos said.",
      "\u201cMy last college match,\u201d he said of the unexpected visit to the tournament. \u201cToday was like a reward for me.\u201d"

    "name": "The Outrageous Star Power of El Duque",
    "author": "By Jack Curry",
    "publication_date": "2023-05-03T20:30:06.000Z",
    "body": [
      "The mystery man was tall and lean and he was smiling, perpetually smiling. His life had dramatically changed when he left Cuba in a fishing boat, and it was about to change again. Every day featured more changes, more smiles and more glimpses of the pitcher known as El Duque.",
      "That was the scene on a sunny spring training day when Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez first pitched in front of the Yankees. After fleeing Cuba on the day after Christmas in 1997, he took a dangerous and circuitous route to signing a four-year, $6.6 million contract with the Yankees. Now Hern\u00e1ndez was finally on a mound in Tampa in late March of 1998, surrounded by curious Yankees coaches and executives who were eager to see him pitch.",
      "He tossed a baseball softly and confidently, the ball snapping off his fingertips and popping into the catcher\u2019s mitt. There was an ease and a swagger about Hern\u00e1ndez, a recognition that all eyes were on him and a realization that he adored the attention. After more than a year of not playing baseball, he was finally pitching again.",
      "On that day in Tampa, the real El Duque antics started when he pitched from a windup and unveiled a funky motion that was different from any that the attendees had ever seen. His eyes looked menacing as he held his glove in front of his face, but it was his limber and acrobatic leg kick that made him so distinctive. He lifted his left leg and it climbed higher and higher, his knee almost brushing his chin, and then he peered to the side before reconnecting with the target and powering forward to fire a pitch. It was athletic. It was balletic. It was gorgeous.",
      "\u201cHe showed up for this bullpen session in Tampa and he just had this presence about him like he was Michael Jordan,\u201d said General Manager Brian Cashman. \u201cThere was something projecting from him, a presence that you could feel. It was greatness. He wasn\u2019t cocky, but there was something about him.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez did not have a single major league inning on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but Cashman saw a similar ultracompetitive nature between the pitcher and Jordan.",
      "\u201cI feel like when you\u2019re around successful people, they emit an aura about them,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cAnd, before El Duque knew what he could do around here, he was emitting that aura. He had a presence.\u201d",
      "Cashman wasn\u2019t alone in instantly noticing Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s presence, his confidence and his talents. He was so excited to pitch again, so excited to be a Yankee and, honestly, was probably excited to show off. He had been the king of the mound in Cuba, a baseball-obsessed country where he had a gaudy 129-47 record for Havana\u2019s Industriales, who are Cuba\u2019s version of the Yankees.",
      "As I watched El Duque, on and off the field, I eventually realized there was no one like him. He was daring and proud and focused and captivating. While working on ",
      " \u201cThe 1998 Yankees: The Inside Story of the Greatest Baseball Team Ever,\u201d there were constant reminders that Hern\u00e1ndez was the most fascinating player on that historic team. I devoted a chapter to him and called it \u201cInternational Man of Mystery\u201d because he made an already great team even more imposing, because he was a very savvy and gutsy pitcher and because he was a joy to observe.",
      "\u201cCouldn\u2019t stop watching him,\u201d said David Cone, another Yankees pitcher known for his creativity. \u201cWanted to see what he did next.\u201d",
      "How could El Duque pitch so effectively with a leg kick that would make a Rockette proud? How many arm angles did he use? How many pitches did he throw? The questions hovered over Hern\u00e1ndez, and he answered them all emphatically while going 12-4 with a 3.13 earned run average. Then he won the Yankees\u2019 most important game of the season in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series.",
      "He was immune to pressure.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has written the right movie script for this guy,\u201d said catcher Jorge Posada. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to really tell his story and what he had to go through to get here and pitch for the Yankees. That\u2019s just a movie waiting to happen. It was unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Covering Hern\u00e1ndez in 1998 was highly entertaining, a delightful show every time he stared at a batter. He was just different. Even the way he prepared for games was different. Before he picked up a baseball, he would do wind sprints, leg kicks and calisthenics in the outfield, making other pitchers look like weekend warriors.",
      "Most pitchers don\u2019t speak to reporters before starts, but Hern\u00e1ndez was chatty. Before his fifth start, he casually told reporters that Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader and a man he reviled, would very likely watch him pitch against the Mets, and he added, \u201cHe knows everything.\u201d After talking and talking, Hern\u00e1ndez proceeded to throw 141 pitches across eight innings. And he wanted to keep pitching.",
      "\u201cIn Cuba, you don\u2019t have a relief pitcher every time out,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cIn Cuba, it\u2019s win or die.\u201d",
      "The teammate with the best perspective on Hern\u00e1ndez was Posada, who was as headstrong as the pitcher he caught. Of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s 23 starts in the regular season and postseason in 1998, Posada caught 21 of them. All these years later, he searched for the optimal way to describe El Duque.",
      "\u201cHe was just perfection,\u201d Posada said. \u201cHe was so \u2014 well, perfection is a word, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for. He wasn\u2019t nervous. He went through hell and now he\u2019s living his childhood dream. He was just saying: \u2018I\u2019m here. This is the best time of my life and I\u2019m not going to take anything for granted.\u2019 Yeah, I guess perfection is the word I wanted to use.\u201d",
      "In the emotional and feisty Posada, the Yankees had the ideal catcher to handle Hern\u00e1ndez. Posada respected Hern\u00e1ndez and felt an immediate kinship with him because Posada\u2019s father had also defected from Cuba in 1968.",
      "\u201cI told him all about my dad and, of course, it brought us closer,\u201d Posada said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez called Posada \u201ca brother for me then and a brother for me today,\u201d and they were part of a very tight-knit Yankees\u2019 team. After a tumultuous 1-4 start in which Manager Joe Torre and Cashman wondered about their job security, the Yankees cruised through an idyllic season. Pressure? What pressure? The Yankees kept winning, so there was little stress. Until Game 4 of the A.L.C.S. Until they trailed the Indians two games to one in a best-of-seven series.",
      "\u201cIt was really the first time all year that we were worried,\u201d said outfielder Paul O\u2019Neill.",
      "Enter El Duque, an unflappable pitcher who treated the pressure-packed game the same as any other start. On the morning of Game 4, Torre was eating breakfast in the hotel restaurant when he noticed a familiar figure cleaning plates and silverware from tables to help the overtaxed staff. That helper was Hern\u00e1ndez, who was as carefree as a pitcher could be.",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t afraid of a thing,\u201d said Derek Jeter. \u201cAnd, if you think about it, he was the perfect guy for that game.\u201d",
      "Since Hern\u00e1ndez had not pitched in 15 days, it was important for him to navigate through the first inning and find the feel for his pitches. But a single and a walk put two runners on base for Jim Thome, who had blasted two homers in Game 3. And Thome almost went deep again as he drove Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s changeup to right field, but O\u2019Neill caught it in front of the fence for the third out. The Yankees exhaled. Then the game became the El Duque Show as he pitched seven scoreless innings in a 4-0 win.",
      "It is not hyperbole to say that Hern\u00e1ndez rescued the Yankees. Had the Yankees faltered, they would have been one loss away from elimination, and the pressure would have been insufferable. The incessant question would have been: Could the team that won 114 regular season games flop? With all that the Yankees had accomplished, that would have been a crisis they had not faced all season. Instead, El Duque guided the Yankees.",
      "\u201cI had pressure,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cBut I had no fear.\u201d",
      "El Duque gave the Yankees much more than one win that tied the series. In the relieved clubhouse, it was evident that Hern\u00e1ndez had also given the Yankees their swagger back. For 48 tense hours, the Yankees were an uncomfortable bunch who wondered if their remarkable ride was about to end. It didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t because of El Duque, the most compelling character in my book and the most fascinating player on the greatest team ever.",
      "Jack Curry\u2019s new book, ",
      " was released on May 2."

      "\u201cNo matter how powerful or influential, no institution is above the law, and we will ensure the N.F.L. is held accountable,\u201d James said in a statement.",

      "Lord Miles, trained by Saffie Joseph Jr., was scratched by state stewards Thursday evening, in a highly unusual move just hours after the trainer declared he would scratch all of his horses entered in races at Churchill Downs except his Derby entrant. Two other horses, not trained by Joseph, also died in the past week after sustaining leg injuries, including a colt who was also scheduled to run in the Derby, prompting an investigation by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission into the causes of all the deaths.",
      "Joseph\u2019s banishment from the Derby, and from all tracks owned by Churchill Downs Inc., follows a hard line set by the track in 2021 after a colt trained by Bob Baffert, Medina Spirit, failed a drug test after finishing first in the Derby. When the results became known, Medina Spirit was disqualified and Baffert was barred from the Derby and tracks owned by Churchill Downs Inc. for two years.",

      "The two horses trained by Joseph were Parents Pride, who collapsed on Saturday, and Chasing Artie, who collapsed on Tuesday.",
      "The deaths come during one of the few times each year that the sports world is focused on horse racing: The Derby kicks off the Triple Crown season. The deaths are likely to renew longstanding concerns about the ",
      " even as the industry contends with doping scandals, competition from other forms of betting and waning fan interest.",
      "\u201cWe have full confidence in our racing surfaces and have been assured by our riders and horsemen that they do as well,\u201d Churchill Downs said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "At the barn where Lord Miles is stabled, Joseph said on Wednesday that he was \u201cshattered\u201d by the deaths of two of his horses. \u201cThe odds of it happening twice is in the trillions,\u201d he said. \u201cI run almost 4,000 horses, and it\u2019s never happened. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d",
      "Lisa Lazarus, chief executive of the newly minted ",
      ", said both the dirt and turf courses had been examined by its experts and were deemed to be safe. Necropsies will be performed on the horses, and hair and blood samples have been taken and are being fast-tracked for laboratory examinations. Joseph scratched a filly on Wednesday out of precaution and said on Thursday morning that he would also voluntarily scratch the horses he planned to run Thursday, Friday and Saturday, except for Lord Miles. The commission later decided otherwise.",
      "On Thursday morning, Joseph watched as Lord Miles was walked outside his barn before he was taken to the track for light exercise. Joseph checked the horse\u2019s legs both at the barn and on the track.",
      "Asked afterward if he would scratch Lord Miles, he responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Asked why he was checking his legs, he said, \u201cI always do that.\u201d",
      "While Churchill Downs said Wednesday it would \u201ccontinue to take every measure to ensure that we are providing the safest possible environment for horses on our property,\u201d it did not have the authority to require Joseph to scratch his Derby horse because he was already entered in the race. That decision needed to come from the racing commission.",
      "Joseph, 36, a Barbados native, is a leading trainer based in Florida. His 2022 Derby horse, White Abarrio, finished 16th.",
      "According to a database that tracks medication violations, he was fined $500 for a positive test for clenbuterol, a bronchodilator, at Gulfstream Park in Florida in 2015 and $1,000 for a positive test for aminocaproic acid, which treats bleeding disorders, at Monmouth Park in New Jersey in 2021. He is also appealing a 15-day suspension and $500 fine because of a positive test for gabapentin, an anticonvulsant and nerve pain medication, at Presque Isle Downs in Pennsylvania in 2022. His trainee Artie\u2019s Princess was disqualified from the Grade II race.",
      "Horse racing in the United States has long had a culture of drugs and lax regulation and has a far higher rate of horses breaking down and being euthanized than most other places in the world.",
      "Trainers have experimented with anything that may give their horses an edge, including chemicals that bulk up pigs and cattle before slaughter, cobra venom, Viagra, blood-doping agents, stimulants and cancer drugs. Detection is difficult as laboratories scramble to keep up.",
      "Common drugs such as anti-inflammatories pose the greatest risk to horses and riders. At higher levels, pain medicine can mask injury, rendering prerace examinations less effective. If a horse cannot feel pain, it may run harder than it otherwise would, putting extra stress on an injury.",
      "That was one reason the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority was established under the oversight of the Federal Trade Commission. The rules and penalties it has written to eliminate doping and abuse within thoroughbred racing will take effect on May 22.",
      "In 2021, months after Medina Spirit was disqualified from winning the Derby, he ",
      ". A necropsy by California scientists suggested he might have had a heart attack, but they said they could not be sure. They cited an international study of exercise-related sudden deaths in racehorses that found that a cause of death was determined with certainty in about 53 percent of cases, a presumptive cause was established in 25 percent of cases and a specific cause of death could not be determined in about 22 percent of them.",
      "Since 2009, the Jockey Club has kept the Equine Injury Database to track fatal breakdowns on American racetracks and provide a database to analyze how they can be prevented. That first year, thoroughbreds had fatal injuries at the rate of two per 1,000 starts.",
      "Last year, there were 1.25 fatalities per 1,000 starts compared to 1.39 fatalities per 1,000 starts in 2021. It was the fourth consecutive year that the rate had decreased and the first time it had been below 1.3 fatalities per 1,000 starts.",
      "\u201cWe can say with confidence that the risk of fatal injury is heading in a sustained downward direction both overall and in many specific areas,\u201d Tim Parkin, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at the University of Bristol in England, said when announcing the most recent results in March. He said the six months at the end of 2022 was the safest six-month period since the database was created.",
      "Still, clusters of fatal accidents have occurred. Last month, Laurel Park in Maryland was closed for three days after a spate of injuries led to five horses being euthanized. Trainers and owners there said the track\u2019s surface was unsafe. Laurel Park\u2019s owner, 1/ST, disputed the claim.",
      "The sport was badly rocked in 2019 after ",
      " in a span of six months, news that made national headlines and earned the ",
      " and animal rights activists.",
      "In response, state and racing officials strengthened regulations regarding the use of riding crops, medications for horses, education for trainers and jockeys, track safety and recuperation policies for injured horses. Last year, 12 horses died at Santa Anita, and thoroughbred fatalities throughout California fell 54 percent from 144 in 2019 to 66 for the last fiscal year."

      "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Sitting in the Oakland Athletics\u2019 dugout last week, Tony Kemp could not avoid the sights and sounds of protesters as they marched across the stadium in green T-shirts with the words \u201cSell The Team\u201d emblazoned on the front, holding signs that lamented the team\u2019s likely fate.",
      "The rest of the fans, what few there were, joined the protesters\u2019 chants urging John Fisher, the owner of the A\u2019s, to relinquish his hold on the club. They also yelled in rhythmic unison for the team to, \u201cStay in Oakland,\u201d and \u201cSave their jobs,\u201d referring to friendly ushers and security guards, sympathetic to their cause.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d said Kemp, who is in his fourth season in Oakland. \u201cYou are in the dugout and you just feel for them. You think about generationally, people raising their family here and wanting to take their kids to A\u2019s games because they were brought to A\u2019s games as kids. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d",
      "Kemp, like most of the Athletics\u2019 players, empathize with the fans, but \u201chard\u201d does not adequately reflect their plight. The team announced last month that ",
      " for a new stadium and planned to move to the Las Vegas Strip by the 2027 season. It was a crushing blow to the loyal fans, some of whom have cherished the A\u2019s since they moved to Oakland, Calif., in 1968.",
      "But worse, if the relocation happens, the A\u2019s would become the third and final major sports team to leave Oakland since 2019, following the N.B.A.\u2019s Golden State Warriors, who ",
      ", and the N.F.L.\u2019s Raiders, who ",
      " in 2020. All three teams had thrived at various times on the same asphalt acreage in an industrial corner of the city southeast of downtown. But if the A\u2019s actually put together enough money to follow through on their plans, no major professional sports team will be left.",
      "For a city and a region of proud, resilient residents, it would be a shattering triple rejection.",
      "\u201cThe last couple of years, people have just been pummeled by the loss of the Warriors, the loss of the Raiders, and now the A\u2019s,\u201d said Jim Zelinski, a co-founder of S.O.S. (Save Oakland Sports). \u201cIt\u2019s just devastating.\u201d",
      "Zelinski, who attended the first Oakland A\u2019s home game on April 17, 1968, when he was 10, started the advocacy group in 2012. He and friends feared that all three clubs wanted to move, and they petitioned team owners, local politicians, league offices and other fan groups to prevent their departure. They may have staved it off for a time, but now it appears the worst has happened.",
      "Sports teams change cities all too frequently for the fans left behind, and Oakland once benefited from the wounds felt elsewhere. The A\u2019s were born in Philadelphia in 1901, moved to Kansas City, Mo., in 1955 and then took up residence in the East Bay, where they flourished for many of their 56 years there.",
      "\u201cOakland had a professional sports empire that was as good as any,\u201d Zelenski said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been dismantled and it\u2019s hanging onto only one pillar at the moment.\u201d",
      "Zelinski, along with his friends, fellow protesters and many A\u2019s fans, disagree about the level of blame city officials bear for the situation. But most concur that Fisher is a main culprit. They believe that in the past couple of years he intentionally fielded poor teams and refused to make stadium improvements in order to tamp down attendance, then made the case that with so few fans in attendance, and no viable stadium alternative in Oakland, there was no option but to move the franchise.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, the whole region believes that,\u201d said Anson Casanares, 36, one of the protesters and a lifelong resident of Oakland. \u201cWe are losing more than just a team. We are losing our civic pride.\u201d",
      "Oakland\u2019s opponent the night of the protest was the Cincinnati Reds, the team the A\u2019s beat in their first World Series in Oakland in 1972. They also played the Reds in the 1990 Fall Classic, a third consecutive World Series appearance during a period when the A\u2019s were among the most feared and popular teams in Major League Baseball. They drew 2.9 million fans that year, for an average of over 36,000 per game.",
      "\u201cThe Coliseum was the town square of Oakland, where people of all types of backgrounds could gather, and there were generations of fans,\u201d said Andy Dolich, the team\u2019s vice president from 1980-94, when the club was under different ownership. \u201cYou have taken that heart, mind and soul of a city and ripped it out.\u201d",
      "Dolich, who was also the chief operating officer for the San Francisco 49ers, recently co-authored, \u201cGoodbye Oakland,\u201d about the triumph and loss of professional sports in Oakland, along with Dave Newhouse, a sports columnist for The Oakland Tribune. Dolich said city officials, including current and past mayors, protected the civic interests by not conceding to the financial demands of the Raiders and A\u2019s, who he believes intentionally diminished their own product to force a relocation.",
      "\u201cI believe this situation is absolutely self-inflicted, by design,\u201d he said, \u201cno question.\u201d",
      "Dave Kaval, the president of the A\u2019s, denied that. He said the team tried harder than the Raiders or the Warriors to stay in Oakland, spending $2 million a month for most of two years to find a local solution. He said the A\u2019s committed to Las Vegas only after it became evident that the yet-to-be-finalized plan to build a new waterfront stadium at Howard Terminal in the Port of Oakland would take a minimum of seven or eight years to complete.",
      "\u201cThat timeline is just not tenable,\u201d Kaval said in a telephone interview.",
      "But fans once flocked to the see the A\u2019s. As recently as 2019, they drew 1.67 million fans, better than seven M.L.B. teams, and in 2014 they drew more than two million. Both of those seasons, the A\u2019s made the playoffs, indicating that when the club is good, fans show up. Known to have low player payrolls for decades, the A\u2019s still managed to find good, undervalued players though an analytical approach favored by the team\u2019s former general manager, Billy Beane, who is still an adviser.",
      "But lately the team\u2019s payrolls have nose-dived. This year, it sits around $56 million, the lowest out of M.L.B.\u2019s 30 teams In 2022 it was $47.8 million, 29th in the league.",
      "Those cuts coincided with the decision two years ago to simultaneously pursue new stadiums in both Oakland and Las Vegas. Kaval said the A\u2019s say they were instructed to do so by M.L.B., but that announcement angered fans who were unwilling to pay to see a team they felt was destined to leave, creating what appeared to be a self-fulfilling outcome. Attendance dropped by more than half, from 1.66 million in 2019 (the last year before pandemic-related restrictions in stadiums) to 787,902 in 2022.",
      "To make matters worse, before the 2022 season the A\u2019s traded their two best players, first baseman Matt Olson and third baseman Matt Chapman, further enraging disgruntled fans. In 2020, the A\u2019s declined to re-sign the free agent infielder Marcus Semien, a local star, who grew up and attended both high school and college in the East Bay. The team\u2019s top pitchers, Sean Manaea and Frankie Montas, were traded last year as well.",
      "Then, after the team\u2019s 102-loss season in 2022, the final blow was struck when catcher Sean Murphy, the team\u2019s last notable veteran, was traded to Atlanta, where he is again a teammate of Olson.",
      "Meanwhile, the stadium, a vestige of late 1960s multisport concrete brutalism, remained a crumbling, festering ruin \u2014 invaded by possums in the press box \u2014 with whole sections of seating covered by tarps, and numerous concession stands shuttered.",
      "\u201cIt is 10 years past its expiration date,\u201d said Kaval, who noted the A\u2019s paid for recent stadium upgrades.",
      "But the upgrades are modest, at best. Dolich, the former A\u2019s executive, also cast doubt on the true intent of the Howard Terminal project, centered in one of the world\u2019s busiest ports. He called it, a \u201cfigment of the imagination\u201d and added, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have a more complicated location.\u201d",
      "There were concerns about access for cars and public transit, and the proposal included a gondola system to ferry fans to the park.",
      "Joe Audelo, a construction manager, has owned two sets of A\u2019s season tickets since 1988 (he also owned two sets for the Raiders). He attended a recent meeting with A\u2019s executives and asked about the capacity of the gondolas. He was told they could carry 5,000 people per hour, he said.",
      "\u201cSo, it\u2019s going to take seven hours to fill the stadium?\u201d he said Friday night at his seats behind home plate. \u201cIt never seemed real to me.\u201d",
      "Some fans and observers, like Dolich, still think the Las Vegas deal could fall through. Audelo said his gut tells him it is over in Oakland. He is another co-founder of Save Oakland Sports, and he has been disappointed twice before in the last four years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d said his wife, Jennifer Audelo, a lifelong A\u2019s and Raiders fan from nearby Concord, Calif. \u201cMy husband has lost all his teams. It\u2019s like he\u2019s in mourning.\u201d",
      "Not surprisingly, the team is terrible amid this year\u2019s turmoil. At 6-25, they had the worst record in baseball through Wednesday, matching their status of having the lowest payroll and the worst attendance. Still, last Friday, in the team\u2019s first home game since the Las Vegas announcement, there was more noise and energy in the stands, from only 6,423 fans, than there had been all year. Most of it was from the protesters.",
      "The clubhouse remained deathly silent.",
      "\u201cI hate it for the fans,\u201d said Jace Peterson, an A\u2019s outfielder. \u201cHopefully, we can play well and do our part to make it a little better for them.\u201d"

      "In September, when the five-time world chess champion ",
      " accused a 19-year-old American player named Hans Niemann of cheating at a tournament in St. Louis, ",
      ". Carlsen implied that his opponent was surreptitiously playing moves relayed from an outside source, something Niemann strenuously denied.",
      "As the controversy at the prestigious Sinquefield Cup became international news, the International Chess Federation, known as FIDE, which is the governing body for the game, promised a full investigation. The report, which was completed in February, was originally supposed to be published in April, ",
      ".",
      "Now, the wait for answers just got a lot longer.",
      "On Wednesday, a federation official, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, said the report was delayed because the organization \u201chas decided to hold the matter in abeyance until at least October of this year pending possible further developments in the civil suit between the parties.\u201d",
      "The suit at issue is a $100 million defamation claim brought last year by Niemann against Carlsen and Chess.com, the world\u2019s largest chess website, which had accused Niemann of cheating in online games. A top-ranked player, Hikaru Nakamura, was also named in the suit and accused of amplifying Carlsen\u2019s statements in online videos.",
      "It is unclear why FIDE believes it should steer clear of a lawsuit to which it is not a party, but Terrence Oved, an attorney for Niemann, believes it comes down to money. He noted that last year, Chess.com acquired Carlsen\u2019s company, Play Magnus, and that FIDE has financial deals with two subsidiaries of Play Magnus, Chessable and Chess24. ",
      ".",
      "\u201cGiven the deep-rooted financial ties between FIDE, Chess.com, Play Magnus and Magnus Carlsen,\u201d Oved wrote in an email, \u201cFIDE\u2019s sudden refusal to disclose the results of its independent investigation bolsters our belief that the results of that investigation are highly favorable to Niemann and raises serious concerns that this scandal runs even deeper than anticipated.\u201d",
      "David Llada, FIDE\u2019s director of communications, said that the decision to postpone the release of the report and any potential disciplinary action was made by the organization\u2019s Ethics and Disciplinary Commission, not by its president or any high-level executive.",
      "\u201cThe E.D.C. are professionals and act according to the best interests of FIDE and the chess community,\u201d Llada said. \u201cThey also act with the highest degree of independence from FIDE to preserve their impartiality.\u201d",
      "In the chess world, there was hope that the report would clear up what exactly happened in St. Louis last year, one of the strangest and noisiest chess controversies in the game\u2019s history.",
      "It began when Niemann beat Carlsen, whom many regard as the greatest player ever, during an early match at the round-robin Sinquefield Cup. It was a surprising triumph, though Carlsen\u2019s swift departure from the tournament quickly overshadowed it. The internet was soon awash with theories about how Niemann might have secreted a radio device on his body. In a postgame interview at the Cup, Niemann offered to play naked, in a radio signal-proofed room, to prove he was playing clean.",
      "Two weeks after the tournament ended, Carlsen made clear what was implied by his hasty exit.",
      "\u201cI believe that Niemann has cheated more \u2014 and more recently \u2014 than he has publicly admitted,\u201d ",
      " on Twitter. He grew suspicious, he continued, because Niemann didn\u2019t seem particularly tense at critical moments and outplayed him \u201cin a way I think only a handful of players can do.\u201d",
      "This was far from definitive proof, but not long after Carlsen\u2019s tweet, Chess.com ",
      ", and stated that he had very likely cheated more than 100 times.",
      "Niemann acknowledged in interviews last year that he had, in fact, cheated in online games when he was younger, something he said he deeply regretted. He also said emphatically that he had never cheated during an over-the-board game, as in-person chess is known.",
      "Many in the chess world did not believe him. In the lawsuit, which was filed in October, Niemann\u2019s lawyers said that their client had been \u201cegregiously\u201d defamed by Carlsen and Chess.com and thrust into \u201cthe center of what is now widely reported as the single biggest chess scandal in history.\u201d",
      "Erik Allebest, the chief executive of Chess.com, said, \u201cI\u2019m not in contact with FIDE on this topic, nor do I have any theories, unfortunately.\u201d Henrik Carlsen, Magnus Carlsen\u2019s father and adviser, declined to comment.",
      "The Sinquefield Cup game between Carlsen and Niemann has become one of the most studied in decades, and grandmasters who looked closely found nothing supercomputer-like in the American\u2019s play. Rather, they said, Carlsen made a few highly uncharacteristic mistakes. Viswanathan Anand, a five-time world champion, put it this way: \u201cI thought Carlsen literally cracked at the end.\u201d",
      "Though the full contents of the report remain a secret, one crucial detail is known. FIDE retained a professor of computer science at the University at Buffalo named Kenneth Regan, who has developed what is widely considered the world\u2019s most sophisticated cheating detection algorithm \u2014 a way to track how closely a player\u2019s moves mirror those of supercomputers that can outplay anything with a pulse.",
      "Regan was asked by the chess federation to study Niemann\u2019s playing during the Sinquefield Cup and other over-the-board tournaments. Did he find evidence that Niemann had cheated?",
      "\u201cUnequivocally no,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not much more to say about it.\u201d",
      "Time is slowly adding heft of its own to this verdict. Niemann has continued to play in professional tournaments, and he keeps getting better. His rating is higher than it was during the Sinquefield Cup, and has now crossed the 2700 threshold that separates merely great players from the most elite. When the Sinquefield Cup began, he was ranked 49th in the world. ",

      "Locally sourced and labeled forklifts \u2014 Ferrari 1, Ferrari 6 \u2014 motored to and from garages, beeping warnings as they came and went. Crews in team uniforms unwrapped cases of rims. Outside the Red Bull garage, two men inserted sensors into huge Pirelli tires.",
      "The garages themselves, where the racecars were being reassembled by crew members blaring music, were off limits to outsiders, for competitive reasons. Practice laps were only a few days away. But no one seemed frazzled. They do this almost every week.",
      "Last year, bad weather and vessel congestion delayed a ship in Singapore that had been headed to the Australian Grand Prix, Price said. With the clock ticking down to practices and qualifying, DHL diverted three planes and urgently sent employees to Singapore to unpack the sea freight containers and hustle the cargo into airfreight ones. Everything made it to Melbourne.",
      "But people like Polhammer and Price cannot focus on just a single race at a time. Interviewed in Miami, they were already thinking about upcoming competitions, especially the one later this month in Monaco, where the narrow streets, Price noted with concern, \u201caren\u2019t built for trucks.\u201d",
      "The Las Vegas Grand Prix, scheduled to debut in November, will present an altogether different challenge, Polhammer said. As soon as it ends, everything will have to be packed up and flown to Abu Dhabi, which is 11 hours ahead. It will help that the Vegas race will be on a Saturday night rather than the traditional Sunday slot, he added.",
      "But he can worry about that later, after the long hauls to Britain, Belgium and Brazil.",
      "With this year\u2019s season running from ",
      " to November and requiring travel across five continents, people like Polhammer and Price spend most of their time on planes and in hotel rooms. Price, who lives in England and began his career as a Formula 1 truck driver, estimated he gets about two days a month at home. Polhammer, who lives in Austria and has worked for F1 for 16 years, said that last year he spent more than 260 nights on the road.",
      "\u201cI admire and take my hat off to anyone that holds down a family and a relationship with this job,\u201d Price said.",
      "It is difficult to explain to people outside the logistics business what they do. \u201cThey\u2019re all like, \u2018What a glamorous lifestyle!\u2019\u201d Polhammer said. \u201cWe are definitely not part of that.\u201d",
      "No other sport compares in terms of moving so much volume over such long distances in short periods of times, he added.",
      "\u201cF1 \u2014 its deadlines do not move,\u201d Price said. In normal commerce, he added, schedules can be adjusted. In Formula 1, \u201cthe green flag will go on Sunday no matter what.\u201d",
      "Then the packing will begin again, even before the champagne is sprayed on the podium.",
      "\u201cIt takes three to four days to set all this up,\u201d Price said, \u201cand we pack it down in three to four hours.\u201d"

      "In Justin Verlander\u2019s first start of the season, he pitched like an ace.",
      "No, he wasn\u2019t particularly dominant. And no, the Mets did not win.",
      "But Verlander, 40, took the mound Thursday afternoon at Detroit\u2019s Comerica Park \u2014 the scene of many of his career highlights from his days with the Tigers \u2014 gave up back-to-back home runs in the first inning, and then he refused to give up. Even as the Tigers, one of the worst hitting teams in baseball, drove several of Verlander\u2019s pitches into hard-hit outs, he stayed steady, keeping the score close through five gutsy innings in which he allowed five hits, two runs and one walk and struck out five batters over 79 pitches.",
      "In a season in which the starting rotations of both New York teams have seemed almost cursed by injuries and ineffectiveness, that was enough to find a ray of sunshine.",
      "\u201cYou saw his stuff, so to speak, and velocity and crispness kind of get better as the game went on,\u201d Mets Manager Buck Showalter said after the game. \u201cI could tell he was getting after it the last inning.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI think that bodes well. The good thing is, he felt good physically. That was a highlight of the day.\u201d",
      "But there are still plenty of clouds.",
      "The Mets, with the highest payroll in major league history (and a record tax bill to come) went on to lose, 2-0, completing a brutal three-game sweep in Detroit. They have lost nine of their last 11 games and have seen their deficit to Atlanta in the National League East climb from half a game through play on April 22 to six games after the Braves completed a three-game sweep of the Marlins with a 6-3 win on Thursday afternoon in Miami.",
      "The season has not gone much better for the Yankees, who have the worst record in the American League East (17-16) and beyond their own ace, Gerrit Cole, have struggled with starting pitching.",
      "Coming into the season, both rotations had projected to be among the best in baseball. The Yankees, who already boasted three All-Star starters in Nestor Cortes, Luis Severino and Cole, added the All-Star left-hander Carlos Rod\u00f3n in free agency on ",
      ". The Mets, who already had the highest-paid starting pitcher in major league history, Max Scherzer, complemented their ace with Verlander (giving him the same $43.3 million salary as Scherzer), while also signing ",
      ", a promising right-hander from Japan, and ",
      ", a veteran left-hander who was solid for Pittsburgh and St. Louis last season.",
      "For all that star power, the Yankees\u2019 starting rotation came into Thursday ranked 11th in the majors in E.R.A. at 4.07 \u2014 bolstered mightily by Cole\u2019s sterling 1.35 effort \u2014 and the Mets were ranked 25th at 5.56, which was nearly two full runs worse than they were last season.",
      "Most of that has been a result of injuries. Rod\u00f3n (elbow and back issues) and Severino (lat strain) have yet to pitch this season, nor has Quintana (rib surgery). Senga (3-1, 4.15 E.R.A.) has tantalized, even if his results are mixed, but Cortes (3-2, 4.91), a breakout star last season, has disappointed.",
      "On top of all of that, Scherzer, in his second year with the Mets, was ",
      " against the Dodgers on April 19 and accepted ",
      " for a violation of M.L.B.\u2019s prohibition on the use of foreign substances. He struggled in his first game back from his suspension, allowing six earned runs over three and one-thirds innings Wednesday in the second game of a doubleheader.",
      "With a group of mostly fill-in starters unable to shoulder the load that was expected to be carried by their stars, the Yankees and the Mets have combined to start the season 33-31. At the same point last season, they were a combined 45-19.",
      "How soon the cavalry will arrive remains an open question. It was announced this week that Rod\u00f3n would undergo further testing on his back, and Quintana, who just started playing catch, is likely months away from a return. Severino is on the verge of beginning a rehab stint in Class A, but as he has combined for only 120 innings pitched over the last four seasons, his health will have to be closely monitored.",
      "And for all of those reasons, having Verlander come back and fight his way through a start was a positive, even if it came in a loss. Because that\u2019s what aces do."

      ". He was still light on his feet, though, as he high-stepped into a breeding shed last month as if he were on a red carpet. A mare named Bernina Star shuffled before him.",
      "Her bloodlines were aristocratic, her racing record impressive. After her career, she fetched $1.2 million at auction to do what she was about to do.",
      "Bernina Star whinnied. Flightline rocked high onto his back legs. The two tangoed and tangled, oblivious to the man holding the mare\u2019s tail or the two other chaperones circling this tryst.",
      "Soon, Flightline\u2019s tail dropped like a flag on a windless day. He fell back to earth. It was time for a bath, and then a night out in the bluegrass.",
      "If the Kentucky Derby is considered the most exciting two minutes in sports, this was perhaps the most lucrative 52.48 seconds in sports. Bernina Star\u2019s owner paid $200,000 for (not quite) a minute of Flightline\u2019s time.",
      "That payday explains why the greatest horses in racing \u2014 including, in all likelihood, the winner of Saturday\u2019s Derby \u2014 are destined to have short careers, and why fans can\u2019t enjoy the best horses for long. The economics of modern horse racing practically guarantee it.",
      "On the racetrack, it took Flightline two years and six undefeated races to earn $4.5 million in purses. Doing what came naturally twice a day in the breeding shed, he matched that total in 11 days, doubled it in 22 and, with 155 mares in his date book, will have generated $31 million in earnings by the end of the five-month breeding in July.",
      "In a sport perpetually troubled by doping scandals, the ",
      " ",
      ", competition from other kinds of gambling and waning interest among fans, it is a counterintuitive choice to retire him. Just last November, at 4 years old, Flightline was the most exciting thoroughbred in the world. He had won all of his six races by a combined 71 lengths and brought large crowds to see him soar around racetracks like Pegasus.",
      "Imagine LeBron James being pushed into coaching after his second season in the N.B.A. The racing industry has done something like that with Flightline.",
      "\u201cYou can work through it and justify it by recognizing that he\u2019s a special talent and you hope he can replicate it and produce fast horses in the future,\u201d said Terry Finley, the founder and president of West Point Thoroughbreds, one of the five entities that own Flightline.",
      "But Finley conceded that this thinking comes at a cost to fan enthusiasm: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not good for the game.\u201d",
      "Thoroughbred racing in the United States",
      "has a rich and tawdry history that has often mirrored that of the nation. In 1823, Eclipse met Sir Henry in a match race that pitted North versus South, an early window into the regional bitterness that would lead to the Civil War.",

      ".",
      "If there is a principle that unifies the sport, it is the inclination \u2014 no, commitment \u2014 to always take the money.",
      "In Central Kentucky, the money is atop purple-flowered bluegrass that is framed by plank fences and pulled like a canvas over gently rolling hills. Farm roads weave between weather-vaned barns and stately homes. In between are horses as far as you can see.",
      "Foals figuring out the stilts that are their legs. Hungry weanlings trailing after their full-figured mothers. Broad-shouldered stallions languidly patrolling their expansive paddocks like beat cops long after everyone has gone home.",
      "Flightline lives at Lane\u2019s End Farm in a five-acre paddock, a tiny patch of lawn on a 2,000-acre spread.",
      "He takes his turn in the breeding shed with 20 other stallions. Seventy-seven yearlings zigzag in paddocks like the rambunctious adolescents they are. More than 200 mares \u2014 some pregnant, others nursing new foals \u2014 bring life to this horsy Brigadoon. ",
      "Lane\u2019s End and its neighbors are at the center of a $6.5 billion industry that puts 61,000 people to work on more than 831,000 acres. But for how long?",
      "Horse racing has been declining for decades. In 2002, more than $15 billion was bet on races in the United States; last year, the handle fell to $12 billion. In 2000, nearly 33,000 thoroughbred foals were registered, almost double the number from last year.",
      "Still, the competition to create a generational talent like Flightline has never been fiercer.",
      "Horsemen and horsewomen have tried for centuries to breed champion thoroughbreds, relying on a combination of science, intuition and luck. \u201cBreed the best to the best and hope for the best\u201d has been the prayer murmured for generations.",
      "In horse racing\u2019s golden age, the Whitneys, the Vanderbilts and business titans like the textile manufacturer Samuel Riddle bred horses primarily to race. In 1919 and 1920, Riddle\u2019s Man o\u2019 War won 20 of 21 races. When Man o\u2019 War was sent to the breeding barn, Riddle restricted his book to about 25 mares a year, most owned by him or his friends and family.",
      "The 1941 Triple Crown champion, Whirlaway, made 60 starts in his career. The first 11 Triple Crown winners together made 104 starts at age 4 or older, and won 57 of them.",

      "The last two Triple Crown champions \u2014 American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018 \u2014 were also retired at 3, but after running far fewer races than Secretariat. American Pharoah\u2019s stallion rights were bought for $30 million after the colt went 9 of 11 as a 2- and 3-year-old. Justify brought $60 million after only six races, all as a 3-year-old.",
      "Craig Bernick, president of Glen Hill Farm in Ocala, Fla., is from a prominent racing family. He tries to adhere to his grandfather\u2019s model: Breed your mares, keep and race the fillies and sell the colts at auction.",
      "\u201cHe was a traditional sportsman,\u201d Bernick said of his grandfather Leonard Lavin, who founded the beauty products company Alberto-Culver, which Unilever bought in 2010. \u201cI wish there were more like him and I could be like that today. But now I must be more commercial. I need to invest in stallion shares and take some of my yearlings to auction in Europe.\u201d",
      "The hurry to get horses to the stallion barn has had unintended consequences in an agribusiness that is contracting: accelerated inbreeding.",
      "While the number of broodmares has remained consistent, the stallion population has dwindled. In 1991, Kentucky had 499 stallions whose books averaged 29.9 mares a year. Last year, Kentucky had 200 registered stallions who averaged 84 mares a year. Many argue that this is not sustainable.",
      "Three years ago, the Jockey Club, which keeps the breed registry, cited scientific studies that showed the thoroughbred gene pool was getting too shallow, endangering the breed. It tried to cap the number of mares a stallion could impregnate at 140. ",
      " was challenged in court by three farms that collectively stood 16 stallions that bred more than 140 mares each in 2020. One of the farms, Coolmore, also shuttles some of its stallions to Australia to breed another 50 to 100 mares in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Last year, the Jockey Club abandoned the rule after the Kentucky legislature, swayed by lobbyists for some commercial breeders, proposed a bill that prohibited the cap and would have put the state racing commission in charge of the registry for Kentucky-bred thoroughbreds.",
      "Bill Farish, the owner of Lane\u2019s End, supported the rule even though the farm stands stallions that breed more than 140 mares.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just simple math to me,\u201d said Farish, who also has an interest in Flightline. \u201cMaybe my brain works too simply. But if you have half the number of stallions breeding a similar number of mares, it\u2019s got to be shrinking the pool.\u201d",
      "Mike Repole was on the phone. No, make that two phones.",
      "On one, he was barking orders at his bloodstock agent, who was in Ocala, bidding on a filly in a 2-year-old-in-training sale.",
      "\u201cGo to 280K,\u201d Repole told the agent. \u201cGood.\u201d",
      "Someone bid $290,000.",
      "\u201cHit them right back,\u201d Repole said, his voice tightening. \u201cBe quicker. Show them we want this one.\u201d",
      "Soon, the gavel dropped at $310,000 and Repole Stable owned another horse.",
      "On the other call, with a reporter, Repole tried to explain the dysfunction of horse racing. ",
      "Repole grew up in Middle Village, Queens, and spent ample time on the rail at Aqueduct, the bluest collar of racetracks. He got into the beverage business, building first Vitaminwater and then BodyArmor sports drink into brands attractive enough for Coca-Cola to purchase for nearly $10 billion.",
      "Repole has spent more than $300 million buying horses. He has won dozens of the most prestigious stakes races \u2014 including the Belmont on Long Island and the Travers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He developed a colt named Uncle Mo into one of the sport\u2019s most accomplished stallions.",
      "On Saturday, he will host 75 family members and friends in Louisville, Ky., at the 149th running of the Derby, where Forte \u2014 a colt he co-owns \u2014 is the 3-1 favorite.",
      "Repole is confounded by horse racing\u2019s resistance to change and its unwillingness to embrace best practices. For example, if Forte wins the Derby \u2014 the first of the Triple Crown races \u2014 he will race two weeks later in the second leg, the Preakness in Baltimore. If he doesn\u2019t, he will skip the Preakness to get some rest and return to the track five weeks later at Belmont Park.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all for tradition, but wouldn\u2019t it be better for the horses if there was more time between races?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf the Derby was in May, the Preakness in June and Belmont in July, you would have bigger fields with better horses to get fans excited.\u201d",
      "He has compared horse racing to a poorly run restaurant with a fabulous menu.",
      "\u201cYou know the service is bad and you don\u2019t like the room, but once you get there the food is just so good,\u201d Repole said.",
      "He has campaigned for a national league office \u2014 a central authority that could bring racetracks, owners, trainers and breeders together on important issues.",
      "\u201cWe all know we\u2019re screwing it up,\u201d Repole said. \u201cHorse racing is like a board game with no directions. I\u2019m one of the biggest owners and I don\u2019t know where to go when I have a problem. There is a selfishness built into the game. Everyone treats it like a secret club when we should be sharing and celebrating it.\u201d",
      "In six months or so, Repole and Forte\u2019s co-owner, the Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola, will decide whether to keep Forte on the racetrack or follow the sport\u2019s unifying principle and take the money by sending him to the barn.",
      "For Flightline\u2019s owners, there is no looking back. By the time Flightline\u2019s first offspring hit the racetrack in 2026, he will have generated more than $120 million in revenue.",
      "If they are fast and win races, his stallion fee is likely to rise. America\u2019s leading sire, Into Mischief, is 18 years old and commands $250,000 a mating. If Flightline is unable to consistently pass on his extraordinary speed, his price will be adjusted down.",
      "Either way, if Flightline stays healthy, he will be an equine A.T.M. for the ages.",
      "In Flightline\u2019s racing days, he was so excited to run that his trainer had to take him to the track at 3 a.m. each day so he wouldn\u2019t kick down his stall. Knowing this, the horse\u2019s owners went to great expense to put thick pads in his retirement stall so he wouldn\u2019t hurt himself.",
      "The pads don\u2019t have a mark on them.",
      "Flightline likes what he does \u2014 so much so that in the first couple weeks of his new career, he refused to leave the breeding shed long after goodbyes were exchanged."

While Butler, soon to complete a 56-point masterpiece, pranced in full-throated fashion, there sat Riley, a gray-haired Buddha, arms folded across his suit jacket and tie, smiling without celebrating, blinking but not moving.",
      "No surprise, really. By this point in a long basketball life, what has Riley not already seen that would make him compromise on his veneer of calculated, unflappable control?",
      "Circulating online, the clip was another striking visual to add to the Riley collection. From the 1966 national championship game in which a ",
      " dominated by Black players defeated his ",
      " to his tenured role as the Heat\u2019s president, Riley has been tethered to basketball history of tectonic magnitude.",

Had there been an award for most venerable personality, the man who inspired Michael Douglas\u2019s Gordon Gekko look for the 1987 film \u201cWall Street\u201d would have to be its inaugural designee.",
      "Riley\u2019s run as a coach and executive is arguably the most remarkable of all, given the generational shifts he has withstood. West is a front-office Lakers legend but was a reluctant three-season coach. ",
      " has more than double the head coaching titles (11-5), but he took on only star-laden rosters and was a bust as Knicks president. ",

      "\u2019s upcoming retirement. Feelers to others affiliated with the Heat were met with a familiar refrain: Riley does not want anyone but Spoelstra and his players speaking publicly during the playoffs.",

      ", a Riley prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who became his coaching antagonist after Riley\u2019s stormy departure from New York in 1995, said: \u201cHe morphed into the boss that he always wanted, the boss he thinks you should be. Stay behind the scenes. Do your job.\u201d",
      "Dave Checketts, who in 1991 hired Riley to coach the Knicks, recalled a phone conversation in which West, with whom Riley occasionally clashed during the Lakers\u2019 Showtime era, warned him, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to figure out how to handle the press because Pat will lose his mind when someone says something he doesn\u2019t want out there.\u201d",
      "Said Checketts: \u201cAnd Pat did say when he came, during hours and hours of conversation, that we needed to speak in one voice. That\u2019s why I give him tremendous credit for what he\u2019s done in Miami \u2014 he\u2019s lived by what he\u2019s espoused. And Spoelstra has been a great spokesman, too.\u201d",
      "Six years ago, during my last extended conversation with Riley, he did veer off the agreed-upon interview topic \u2014 Magic Johnson\u2019s brief ascension to the Lakers\u2019 presidency. When I complimented him for refusing to tank, for remaining competitive despite losing James to Cleveland and ",
      " to a medical issue, Riley said:",
      "\u201cPlayers come and go, great players. When LeBron left, that was the most shocking thing to me \u2014 not to say he was right or wrong \u2014 and the most shocking thing to the franchise. But our culture is the same. You have your up years and your down years, but what can\u2019t change is the way you do things.\u201d",
      "That wasn\u2019t necessarily the whole truth. After the Heat lost to San Antonio in the 2014 N.B.A. finals, Riley, undoubtedly referring to James\u2019s looming free agency, told reporters: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay together if you\u2019ve got the guts. And you don\u2019t find the first door to run out of.\u201d",
      ". An old Riley tactic \u2014 challenging players\u2019 manhood \u2014 fell on deaf, new-age ears. Most spiels grow old. And Riley, 69 at the time, is now a more muted 78, a stealth operator, Godfather Riley more than Gordon Gekko Riley. Yet he remains indisputably relevant, still resplendent, while watching and waiting for the auspicious occasion that will merit his last hurrah."

      "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The soccer coach looked out at two dozen or so of his players and felt nervousness course through him like a rip current. His heart pounded, and his voice felt unsteady.",
      "Kaig Lightner (pronounced \u201cCage,\u201d a phonetic shortening of his initials \u2014 K and J) had been thinking of this moment since the summer of 2013 when he founded the Portland Community Football Club, a program for teaching soccer to mostly first- and second-generation immigrant youth who lived in his city\u2019s most distressed neighborhoods.",
      "In the four years since, Coach Kaig had become a friend, an ally and even, to some of his players, a father figure.",
      "How would they react once he told them he had been raised as a girl?",
      "He had always asked his players to be open and honest about their lives. That he had not modeled such deep honesty filled him with remorse.",
      "The election of Donald Trump \u2014 who had promised to appoint conservative judges and whose vice president, Mike Pence, had opposed gay rights and was ",
      " \u2014 had ignited a sense of foreboding and uncertainty within the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Lightner certainly felt it. He worried that the players \u2014 tweens and teens on this afternoon \u2014 would leave his club. Or that their families would cut ties, no matter how good the program had been at mentoring and providing a safe space to grow up in.",
      "Lightner considered all of this, took a deep breath and knew he needed to speak up.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t totally shared with you something about myself.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important thing for me to share with you because we all should be who we are.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am transgender.\u201d",
      "One player chuckled nervously but walked to Lightner for a hug. Most looked straight at their coach in a kind of wonder and awe.",
      "No one left.",
      "Born Katherine Jean Lightner and raised in a comfortable suburb east of Seattle, nothing about Lightner\u2019s adolescence was easy. Lightner, who consented to the use of his former name and gender identity throughout this article, recalls a paralyzing fear that began around age 4 that he was a boy stuck in a girl\u2019s body. When his family called him Katie, he protested. It sounded too feminine. Kate was better by a shade. He refused ballet lessons. His mother bought him a tailored dress. He wore it once, then vowed to never wear it again.",
      "As the years went on, Kate favored baggy pants, sweats, billowing T-shirts and baseball caps turned backward. A favorite birthday gift was a bright red Michael Jordan baseball jersey.",
      "\u201cThe way she presented, she did not look like a typical girl,\u201d recalled Leslie Ridge, a friend who attended high school with Lightner in the 1990s. \u201cAnd because of that, she was made fun of constantly, especially by boys. It was brutal to see how painful that was for her.\u201d",
      "The bullying taunts and sense of unease ignited a terrible internal storm. \u201cI began to think of myself as a freak,\u201d recalls Lightner. \u201cThe feeling was that I don\u2019t belong here. I don\u2019t belong in any space.\u201d",
      "Sports became a refuge.",
      "An excellent softball, basketball and soccer athlete, Lightner found that on fields and courts he could be judged solely based on performance.",
      "\u201cSports kept me alive.\u201d",
      "After rowing crew at the University of Washington, Lightner moved to Portland after graduation in the early 2000s. There he coached soccer for kids between 8 and 14 on a team that initially looked much the same as the white, affluent ones on which Lightner had grown up playing.",
      "After changing his name to Kaig, Lightner approached a fellow soccer coach he regarded as a trustworthy friend and explained that this was a first step toward becoming a man.",
      "The reaction was laughter.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to realize that coaching as an out trans person at that time, in the years around 2005, \u201906, \u201907, was just not going to work,\u201d Lightner said. \u201cI was not going to be safe.\u201d",
      "Lightner left coaching for a while. He flew to Baltimore for breast removal surgery and began weekly sessions of hormone replacement therapy. His voice deepened. New layers of muscle wrapped around his shoulders. His jaw grew square, and his face sprouted the beginnings of a beard.",
      "Eventually, he took a job as an instructor for after-school programs in the working-class outskirts of Portland, home to the city\u2019s population of immigrants from Africa, Mexico, Central and South America, and Asia.",
      "Lightner quickly saw that the abundant sports opportunities in the city\u2019s wealthier communities barely existed for the kids he was now working with. He had always felt like an outsider and now saw that the players he coached \u2014 the children of working-class immigrants in one of America\u2019s whitest cities \u2014 thought of themselves in much the same way. Considering how he could best help, Lightner focused on what had kept him going through all those years of adolescent anguish.",
      "\u201cSoccer had been my main way of finding healing and connection, and I wanted that for these kids, too,\u201d he said.",
      "After a year of cobbling together seed money, Lightner formed the Portland Community Football Club in 2013 with grant funding and donated equipment from Nike. The club was a rarity because everybody had a place. Nobody got cut. Lightner emphasized developing skilled players more than turning out stars. Families paid $50 to join, but less than that was OK. Not paying a dime was fine, too.",
      "At his first practice, held in a worn corner of a public park, 50 kids showed up. Soon it was 75. Then 100. The club played during the winter, spring, summer and fall.",
      "\u201cCoach Kaig became a constant in our lives,\u201d says Shema Jacques, one of the program\u2019s early stalwarts. Jacques, now a 22-year-old Marine, first picked up the basics of soccer in a Rwandan refugee camp but honed his game at P.C.F.C. \u201cFrom the start, I could tell he believed in us. He would be there for us for anything we needed. I had never experienced someone being like that before.\u201d",
      "Lightner was open about being a transgender man to everyone in his life except the players and families of P.C.F.C., and the dissonance ate at him. So on that rain-swept day in 2017, he gathered every player who had shown up for a chat before practice.",
      "\u201cI want you guys to know about me, and I also want you guys to know that I\u2019m still me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still the same person I was five minutes before you all knew this, right? I\u2019m still the same guy who comes out here, gets you guys to be better soccer players, gets on you when you\u2019re not playing hard, loves you no matter what.\u201d",
      "He saw nothing but acceptance as he looked into his players\u2019 eyes. One of them was Jacques.",
      "\u201cSuddenly, hearing that, it all made sense,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cThis is why he knows what it is like for so many of us \u2014 not being accepted, trying hard to fit in. I actually felt more connected to him as he spoke, and I am not alone. He was still the person I looked up to and wanted to be like.\u201d",
      "Six years later, the only thing that has changed about P.C.F.C. is its growth. There are more coaches and a small administrative staff. The roster of registered players has swelled to 165. It is also about more than just soccer now. During the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Lightner received a grant that allowed P.C.F.C. to provide its families with fresh groceries, rental assistance and help tapping into social services.",
      "\u201cNone of the families abandoned Kaig once he spoke his truth,\u201d says Carolina Morales Hernandez, whose young son and daughter have grown up in the program.",
      "\u201cSometimes people join, and they will call me and say, \u2018We heard this and that about Kaig,\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh yeah, it\u2019s true, yep. The head of the P.C.F.C. is a transgender person, but that changes nothing. Everybody is welcome here.\u2019\u201d"

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 The Tampa Bay Rays had just won again Tuesday night, but their architect was flustered by a small crack in the foundation. One of the Rays\u2019 pitchers had taken a line drive off his foot, another had a forearm problem, a few could have used a break, and nobody from the minors quite fit as a replacement.",
      "Erik Neander, the Rays\u2019 president of baseball operations, wondered if any available veterans were lined up to start in the minors the next day. An assistant, Ryan Bristow, flagged a recent email from the Cincinnati Reds: Chase Anderson, a well-traveled, 35-year-old right-hander for Class AAA Louisville, was available.",
      "Anderson had pitched for a month in the Rays\u2019 farm system last summer \u2014 and, most important, was lined up to start a morning game in Omaha in about 12 hours. Perfect. The Rays made the requisite phone calls, got Anderson for cash considerations \u2014 \u201cMaybe a dollar,\u201d Neander said \u2014 and booked him on a 7 a.m. flight on Wednesday.",
      "That night, naturally, Anderson pitched three scoreless innings against Pittsburgh for his first career save in the majors. Another victory on Thursday gave the Rays a three-game sweep of the Pirates and a spellbinding 26-6 record \u2014 the best 32-game start in the league since the 1984 Detroit Tigers, who won the World Series.",
      "Even those Tigers, though, did not pummel their opponents this thoroughly, this early. The Rays, who will host the Yankees at Tropicana Field this weekend, had outscored opponents by 113 runs before Thursday\u2019s 3-2 win over Pittsburgh. The last team with a wider run differential through 31 games: Honus Wagner\u2019s Pirates in 1902, a year before the creation of the World Series.",
      "\u201cEverybody has confidence, everybody knows what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Harold Ram\u00edrez, who floated through four organizations before becoming a .300 hitter for the Rays. \u201cIt\u2019s like, a lot of people think we are a weird team because we do weird things. But I know everything we do is right.\u201d",
      "Everything? It\u2019s not a stretch. The Rays have scored the most runs in the majors, with the highest batting average, the best on-base plus slugging percentage and the most home runs. Even while using the most pitchers in the majors, the Rays have allowed the fewest runs and homers and the lowest opponents\u2019 average and O.P.S.",
      "\u201cThey just kind of create these pitchers out of nowhere, like people haven\u2019t heard of them before,\u201d said the right-handed starter Zach Eflin, who pitched in the World Series for Philadelphia last fall and eagerly signed with the Rays in free agency. \u201cThere\u2019s been a long kind of rumor in the big leagues, like there\u2019s something in the water in Tampa \u2014 they know what they\u2019re doing down there.\u201d",
      "The three-year, $40 million contract for Eflin, who is 4-0 after his victory on Thursday, was the richest free-agent deal in Tampa Bay history. Yet for all of their bargain shopping and roster churning, the Rays now stand out for something traditional and reassuring: Stability, in both leaders and players.",
      "Kevin Cash became the team\u2019s manager in December 2014, when only one of his peers (Cleveland\u2019s Terry Francona) was in his current position. The hitting coach Chad Mottola and the pitching coach Kyle Snyder are in their sixth season together; no other team has had the same people in those roles for that long.",
      "Then there\u2019s the roster, with 17 players (including those on the injured list) who were part of the organization in 2020, when the Rays won the American League pennant.",
      "\u201cWhen you get a group that\u2019s able to play together for a while, it\u2019s kind of how the March Madness teams are,\u201d the right-handed reliever Pete Fairbanks said. \u201cWhen you get into the tournament and you\u2019ve got a team full of juniors and seniors, those teams typically seem to have the ability to make noise.\u201d",
      "The Rays are more than a collection of role players who know the system. The left-hander Shane McClanahan, who is 6-0, started the All-Star Game last summer at Dodger Stadium. While the Yankees have no everyday players with a .900 O.P.S., the Rays have six, including shortstop Wander Franco, a switch-hitting force, and the stylish left fielder Randy Arozarena, who hit his eighth homer on Thursday.",
      "Franco, 22, is signed through 2032, and while Arozarena, 28, does not have a long-term deal, he cannot be a free agent until after the 2026 season. His payday might come elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI know I play for a small-market team, but obviously I play hard and I do the things I do to be able to get that contract \u2014 and eventually I think it will happen, regardless of if it\u2019s here or not,\u201d Arozarena said in Spanish through an interpreter. \u201cI know we\u2019re in the business of the big leagues, but regardless of the market, all teams have a lot of money.\u201d",
      "The Rays, as usual, are getting a lot for their money: Their player payroll ranks among the majors\u2019 lowest \u2014 roughly $73 million on opening day, ahead of only Baltimore and Oakland \u2014 but they have dominated baseball in nearly every category.",
      "The hitters lead the A.L. in barrel percentage, hard-hit percentage and exit velocity, and the pitching staff is the only one in the majors to rank in the top three in all those categories. Statcast confirms those figures, but it\u2019s a time-tested formula: Hit the ball hard and keep your opponents from doing the same.",
      "\u201cIt looks a lot more complicated from the outsider\u2019s perspective than it actually maybe is inside,\u201d Snyder said.",
      "The Rays\u2019 schedule is getting much tougher now. Their opponents in March and April had a combined .427 winning percentage through Wednesday, but none of their May opponents had a losing record entering the month. But the Rays \u2014 who have made the playoffs four years in a row \u2014 are finding that nobody doubts them anymore.",
      "\u201cBefore, it was: \u2018We\u2019re this, we\u2019re that, we\u2019re a gimmick,\u2019 and suddenly, this year, we\u2019re good,\u201d Mottola said, speaking of the national impression of the Rays. \u201cAnd it\u2019s almost a little concerning \u2014 you\u2019re going, \u2018Wait, wait, we have to keep that underdog mentality.\u2019 If we get stale and complacent and believe that we\u2019re good, then we lose what we\u2019re good at \u2014 if that makes sense.\u201d",
      "The Rays are good at being different. The owner Stuart Sternberg, a former partner at Goldman Sachs, cultivated a Wall Street-savvy front office in the mid-2000s, and Neander worked for Sports Info Solutions, an analytics hub co-founded by John Dewan and Bill James, before joining the Rays in 2007.",
      "But while it\u2019s tempting to credit data for the Rays\u2019 success, it also misses the point. A team can embrace information while also respecting the pulse of the players. For the Rays, that is actually the secret to everything.",
      "The night they scrambled to find Anderson, the Rays used seven pitchers. Only one faced the same hitter twice. The Rays are famous for this strategy; the opener, as it is known, is probably their best-known innovation. Yet the data behind it is mostly a front.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about putting players in position to have success and complete their competitive day feeling good about themselves and wanting to contribute more,\u201d Neander said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to foster confidence. The ideal space is when everyone feels like they can do more.\u201d",
      "The baseball season is very long, of course. But few teams, to this point, have ever done more."

      "The music world turned its eyes to a federal courthouse in Manhattan over the last two weeks, where Ed Sheeran defended himself against an accusation that his 2014 hit \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d copied from Marvin Gaye\u2019s classic \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Sheeran emerged ",
      ", with a jury finding that he and his co-writer, Amy Wadge, had created their song independently.",
      "Here are scenes from inside the courtroom, and takeaways from the case.",
      "An ",
      " in The Washington Post called the lawsuit \u201ca threat to Western civilization.\u201d Sheeran\u2019s lawyers were less hyperbolic but still argued that a loss would have a devastating impact on songwriters by privatizing parts of the public domain.",
      "\u201cCreativity would be stifled for fear of being sued,\u201d Ilene S. Farkas said in her closing statement.",
      "Sheeran\u2019s win means that music\u2019s wider legal landscape remains largely undisturbed. After the shock of the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d verdict in 2015, in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay more than $5 million to Gaye\u2019s family \u2014 a case that many experts felt was wrongly decided \u2014 Led Zeppelin prevailed in a suit involving \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d ",
      " to a more neutral position.",
      "As Sheeran\u2019s lawyers said repeatedly, what the singer was accused of copying included a stock chord progression and syncopated rhythmic pattern. Those elements are so generic that the judge in the case, Louis L. Stanton, stipulated they were not protected by copyright.",
      "The plaintiffs (the family of Gaye\u2019s co-writer, Ed Townsend) needed to prove that the ",
      " of those elements \u2014 their \u201cselection and arrangement\u201d \u2014 was original enough to warrant protection. In general, courts place a high bar on such claims. \u200cUltimately, the jury decided that \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d was created independently, and never addressed whether those aspects of \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d were protected.",
      "Although \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d was played a number of times, jurors never heard Marvin Gaye\u2019s beloved, luxuriously sung recording of \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On.\u201d That is because its songwriting copyright is limited to the minimal sheet music that was supplied to the Copyright Office in 1973.",
      "Instead, the jury heard a computerized \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On,\u201d based on the original sheet music. It was a cold and disembodied performance, complete with a robotic vocal that sounded as if it were coming from a Speak & Spell toy \u2014 a bizarre interpretation for one of the most erotic songs of all time.",
      "Sheeran attended every day of testimony in the trial, and on the stand he could be charming, demonstrating his songwriting with a guitar. He recounted his determination as a 17-year-old aspiring musician to play every open-mic night in London, and said he writes as many as eight or nine songs a day.",
      "But Sheeran, 32, was also at times belligerent and angry. He attacked the testimony of Alexander Stewart, a musicologist testifying for the plaintiffs, as \u201ccriminal.\u201d Under cross-examination, he interrupted Patrick R. Frank, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who questioned Sheeran\u2019s testimony about the chords he played, challenging him, \u201cDo ",
      " believe this?\u201d",
      "A key part of any music copyright trial is the testimony of musicologists hired as expert witnesses for each side, who present dry, abstract analyses of the music.",
      "At the Sheeran trial, the two experts also seemed to take every opportunity to put each other down. Stewart, a professor at the University of Vermont, portrayed his counterpart, Lawrence Ferrara of New York University, as struggling to find persuasive \u201cprior art\u201d \u2014 citations from music history that would undermine the originality of \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On.\u201d",
      "Ferrara fired back. He dismissed Stewart\u2019s estimate that 70 percent of \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d had been taken from \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201coutlandish.\u201d Stewart\u2019s hypothesis that Sheeran had mimicked some of Gaye\u2019s melodies, Ferrara said, was, \u201cto be perfectly honest, absurd.\u201d Other conclusions by Stewart were \u201cfarcical\u201d and \u201cludicrous,\u201d Ferrara said. For musicologists, these were fireworks.",
      "Inside the courtroom, the case was all about chords, rhythms and the fine points of copyright law. But outside, the discourse also involved the history of racial exploitation in the music industry.",
      "In public statements leading up to the trial, Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer who was part of the plaintiffs\u2019 team, defined the dispute squarely in racial terms. \u201cMr. Sheeran blatantly took a Black artist\u2019s music who he doesn\u2019t view as worthy of compensation,\u201d he said at a news conference in March.",
      "In a letter to the judge a week before the trial began, Donald S. Zakarin, one of Sheeran\u2019s lawyers, wrote: \u201cWe respect Mr. Crump\u2019s right to raise institutional concerns he may believe exist, but not in this case and not in this forum.\u201d",
      "Judge Stanton never publicly responded to that request. But in Crump\u2019s closing statement, he never mentioned race."

      "Bruce McCall, whose satirical illustrations for National Lampoon and The New Yorker conjured up a plutocratic dream world of luxury zeppelin travel, indoor golf courses and cars like the Bulgemobile Airdreme, died on Friday in the Bronx. He was 87.",
      "His wife, Polly McCall, said his death, at Calvary Hospital, was caused by Parkinson\u2019s disease.",
      "Borrowing from the advertising style seen in magazines like Life, Look and Collier\u2019s in the 1930s and \u201940s, Mr. McCall depicted a luminous fantasyland filled with airplanes, cars and luxury liners of his own creation. It was a world populated by carefree millionaires who expected caviar to be served in the stations of the fictional Fifth Avenue Subway and carwashes to spray their limousines with champagne.",
      "\u201cMy work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it,\u201d Mr. McCall said in a ",
      ". He called it \u201cretrofuturism,\u201d which he defined as \u201clooking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow.\u201d",
      "To readers of The New Yorker, which ran more than 80 of his gouache-on-paper paintings as covers beginning in 1993, his visual signature and comic universe were as recognizable as those of the magazine\u2019s cartoonists Charles Addams and Roz Chast.",
      "A wider audience knew Mr. McCall through the collections \u201cBruce McCall\u2019s Zany Afternoons\u201d (1982), \u201cThe Last Dream-o-Rama: The Cars Detroit Forgot to Build, 1950-1960\u201d (2001), and \u201cAll Meat Looks Like South America: The World of Bruce McCall\u201d (2003).",
      "He was \u201cour country\u2019s greatest unacknowledged design visionary,\u201d the critic and graphic designer Michael Bierut wrote in Design Observer in 2005, \u201cthe visual poet of American gigantism.\u201d",
      "Bruce Paul Gordon McCall was born on May 10, 1935, in Simcoe, Ontario, to Thomas Cameron and Helen Margaret (Gilbertson) McCall. His father, who was known as T.C., was a civil servant and later Chrysler\u2019s public relations manager in Canada. His mother was a homemaker.",
      "Bruce grew up with five siblings in a home tightly circumscribed by T.C.\u2019s paltry salary and the dour provincialism of Simcoe, in the southwest corner of the province, not far from Lake Erie. This childhood purgatory provided the material for his 1997 memoir, \u201cThin Ice: Coming of Age in Canada.\u201d A second memoir, \u201cHow Did I Get Here?,\u201d was published in 2020.",
      "The family\u2019s relocation to Toronto in 1947 did little to change Mr. McCall\u2019s feelings about his native country, which he later satirized in a feature for National Lampoon, \u201cThe Shame of the North: Life in a Canadian Border Town.\u201d It showed, on a supposedly dissolute strip, derelicts swigging maple syrup and louche emporiums promising such forbidden pleasures as \u201clive, hatless girls.\u201d",
      "American popular culture sparked his imagination, especially the magazines and their advertising, which transmitted \u201cmessages of tomorrow in steel and chrome,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThin Ice.\u201d",
      "\u201cSoon, double-decker Boeing Stratocruisers with cocktail lounges would be flying down to Rio in 20 hours,\u201d he added. \u201cStandard transportation for Everyman was about to be a car you could fly, a plane you could drive.\u201d",
      "After dropping out of high school in Windsor, where the family had moved in 1953, Mr. McCall found work at a local agency that turned out advertisements for Dodge and DeSoto. \u201cThe Detroit products at the time \u2014 those behemoths \u2014 were so awful that I found them funny and ridiculous,\u201d he told The New Yorker in 2002. \u201cSo the roots of satire were planted very early.\u201d",
      "He was hired in 1959 by A.V. Roe & Company in Toronto to retouch photos of pots and pans for its catalogs. A year later his fortunes improved, marginally, when the publishing company Maclean-Hunter hired him to churn out brief articles for trade magazines like Pit & Quarry. He loathed the job.",
      "In desperation, Mr. McCall, a sports car enthusiast, collaborated with a friend to start a magazine, Canadian Driver. It lasted only one issue, but it led to a writing job at Canada Track & Traffic, where Mr. McCall soon became editor in chief.",
      "His first crack at the American dream came in 1962, when David E. Davis, the head of the Campbell-Ewald agency in Detroit, which had Chevrolet as a major account, hired him to write ad copy for Corvettes and Corvairs. It was the springboard to a flourishing career in New York, where he initially worked on Ford advertising at J. Walter Thompson. Later, at Ogilvy & Mather, Mr. McCall was put in charge of advertising for Mercedes-Benz; for several years he ran the agency\u2019s Frankfurt office.",
      "In 1970, Mr. McCall and his friend ",
      ", the editor of Car and Driver, invented a series of mythical airplanes, among them the Humbley-Pudge Gallipoli Heavyish Bomber, for which they wrote pseudo-scholarly historical notes. Playboy bought the idea, assigned Mr. McCall to do the illustrations and ran the collaboration in January 1971 under the title \u201cMajor Howdy Bixby\u2019s Album of Forgotten Warbirds.\u201d It went on to win Playboy\u2019s annual humor award.",
      "\u201cThis went to my head \u2014 in fact rearranged its contents,\u201d ",
      " in an interview for its website in 2008. \u201cOn the basis of that one fluke success, I now felt entitled to see myself as a working professional humorist.\u201d",
      "After returning from Germany, he headed for the offices of National Lampoon with a catalog for the mythical 1958 Bulgemobile. The magazine offered him a contract to illustrate 25 pages a year. He was soon delivering spreads on the luxury liner Tyrannic (\u201cSo safe that she carries no insurance\u201d) and blue-blood sports like tank polo and zeppelin shooting. \u201cPopular Workbench,\u201d a series based on his large collection of 1930s popular science magazines, offered such innovations as a 4,000-horsepower diesel typewriter weighing more than three tons.",
      "McCall wrote for \u201cThe National Lampoon Radio Hour\u201d and put in a brief, unhappy stint as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in the late 1970s before returning to advertising. He joined the McCaffrey\u200c & McCall agency (co-founded by an unrelated McCall), which had just landed the Mercedes account. After several years as creative director for Mercedes advertising, he was named executive vice president and creative director of the agency. He left in 1993.",
      "By then his career as a writer and illustrator had taken off. Infatuated with The New Yorker since childhood, Mr. McCall submitted a humor article for the magazine\u2019s \u201cShouts and Murmurs\u201d department in 1980, the first of more than 80 to be published over the next 40 years. After Tina Brown became editor in 1992, his illustrations appeared regularly on the magazine\u2019s cover and in the back of the book.",
      "Many of his illustrations were on view in 2021 at the New-York Historical Society in the exhibition \u201cThe Fantastic City: Bruce McCall\u2019s New York.\u201d He had long worked from his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.",
      "In addition to his wife, he is survived by their daughter, Amanda McCall; two brothers, Walter and Michael; and a sister, Christine Jerome.",
      "Mr. McCall wrote the children\u2019s book \u201cMarveltown\u201d (2008) and provided the illustrations for \u201cThe Steps Across the Water,\u201d a 2010 children\u2019s book by the New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik.

      "At their first meeting, Willems was \u201cfeigning ignorance\u201d about opera, O\u2019Leary recalled, but the author quickly sent him a copy of an Elephant and Piggie book \u2014 ",
      " \u2014 with the inscription \u201cTim, this book really sings.\u201d By their second encounter, Willems had the libretto in his head, a sketch of the characters in concert dress and a title: ",
      "\u201cObviously, once it was called the \u2018SLOPERA!\u2019 we had to do it,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "\u201cSLOPERA!\u201d could only be performed live outdoors on account of the pandemic, but ",
      ", with piano accompaniment, was shown virtually to more than 300,000 schoolchildren.\u201d Piggie gets Gerald the Elephant to try slop, a stinky green delicacy among porcine foodies. He does, after his initial refusals upset his companion, and he endures the consequences in something like a bel canto mad (or death) scene. He recovers, though, and tells Piggie that while he might not like her food, he still likes her. Scored cutely by Simon, it is funny, catchy and in the end moving, a paean to friendship and trying new things.",
      "\u201cEverything that I do as a picture book writer is reductive,\u201d Willems said, reflecting on what writing his first libretto taught him, aside from the importance of placing consonants carefully. \u201cIf you look at a picture book manuscript, and you can understand it, it has too many words. If you look at just the illustrations, and you can understand it, the drawings are too detailed. They both have to be incomprehensible. It\u2019s very similar with writing an opera, that the words that you\u2019re using have to be dependent on the music, but the music has to be dependent on the words, and either of them shouldn\u2019t really be able to stand alone.\u201d",
      "opera bug and started planning a follow-up, \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Pigeon Sing Up Late!,\u201d which O\u2019Leary said was initially conceived as a monodrama for the inquisitive, intransigent Pigeon \u2014 akin to an avian \u201cErwartung.\u201d Deborah Rutter, the Kennedy Center\u2019s president, also suggested that Willems collaborate with Fleming, the center\u2019s artistic adviser at large.",
      "Fleming sent Willems reams of classic arias to listen to, select from and rewrite to fit how kids might experience emotions like joy, disgust or shame. \u201cThey are sung beautifully,\u201d Fleming said of the results. \u201cThey are sung in all seriousness. It\u2019s just the text. A, it\u2019s in English, and B, it\u2019s really devised for 6-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Smushed together under the title \u201cThe Ice Cream Truck Is Broken!\u201d so that nine rewritten arias surrounded the Pigeon opera, the hourlong show ended up being a bit of a mishmash, as if the remarkable sum of resources being drawn from all over the Kennedy Center \u2014 not least, its comedy budget \u2014 were being thrown around to see what stuck.",
      "The arias didn\u2019t quite land, to judge by the polite but not thrilled reactions of the children sitting near me. Dressed to the nines, Willems and Fleming introduced them, laboring over a running joke about an \u201copera song\u201d really being called an \u201caria.\u201d Felicia Curry, a leading Washington actress, directed with a light touch, sharing with her collaborators a faith in the music itself to connect. Though the early-career singers \u2014 Suzannah Waddington, Siphokazi Molteno, Oznur Tuluoglu, Jonathan Pierce Rhodes, Shea Owens \u2014 were amplified and could not possibly have sung more clearly or enthusiastically, it was still hard for my young assistant either to follow the lyrics with her ears, or to sound out the supertitles in time. I found some of the texts ingenious, but it all felt a bit too earnest, too consciously instructional to inspire.",
      "She was there, in any case, to see a bird sing; and sing the Pigeon did. After eight of the arias and a fair bit of fidgeting came the Willems-Simon piece, which is based on \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late!,\u201d a past-bedtime classic in which the Pigeon works through a repertoire of tactics to ward off sleepy time. Tuluoglu, a young soprano whose most recent prior role was Barbarina at the Annapolis Opera, took on the title character. \u201cWhen you train, you have to be able to sing Mozart, you gotta be able to be a pigeon,\u201d she said before the show.",
      "Willems adds two cousins to the Pigeon\u2019s flock, and in turn the pajama-clad birds try out a trio of techniques \u2014 \u201cNegotiation,\u201d \u201cGuilt\u201d and \u201cTantrum,\u201d as their arias are called \u2014 on an audience that is encouraged to yell back in denial. Simon\u2019s score is a delight, propulsive and charming with a swishing jazz number and a lullaby ripped from Brahms. The kids enjoyed it, and so did the adults.",
      " of so-called family or education programming must surely be something along those lines, but in the experience of this frustrated musical parent, the recipe is often wrong. Willems and his collaborators understand the same thing as their goal, although as the author said, \u201cno one is a true expert in children\u2019s, Al Yankovic-ing, spoofing opera pieces.\u201d Experimentation is required.",
      "\u201cYou have to approach it with all the same seriousness\u201d as a main-stage opera, O\u2019Leary said, \u201cand get all the greatest people involved, because actually kids are the toughest audience, the most discerning, and if you can make it work, then you know you\u2019ve got something.\u201d",
      "Willems has long written books that transcend generational divides: my children love them because they are silly, and I love them because they make me a sillier father than I would ever be without one in my hand. As a librettist \u2014 a description that must now be added to all his other job titles, as he enjoys the collaborative nature of opera so much that he hopes to write a full-scale piece \u2014 he inevitably thinks along the same lines. His arias, he said, were for me and my children alike.",
      "\u201cShe already thinks it\u2019s cool because it\u2019s great music,\u201d Willems said, nodding to my daughter. \u201cYou have a history to it, and by stripping that history away hopefully you\u2019ll listen to it differently. You\u2019re coming into it with preconceived notions, and these guys aren\u2019t, and then there\u2019s somebody in the middle who just, like, saw a lot of ",
      " films, and has a vague sense of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI struggle,\u201d he added, \u201cwith the idea that a grown-up would bring one of the younger people in their lives, with the expectation that that person is going to learn something, but that the person bringing them isn\u2019t. I want everybody to be open to a new experience.\u201d"

      "Sophie N\u00e9lisse keeps a close eye on what she eats. When picking out a restaurant for her 23rd birthday dinner last month, she opted for an Italian spot in Montreal that specializes in naturally leavened pizza, pies without commercial yeast. She shops at ",
      ", the trendy health food store, when she is in Los Angeles. She loves organic buffalo cauliflower.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been eating clean,\u201d she said in a recent video call from her home in Montreal. \u201cIf it\u2019s pizza, I just want it to be fresh ingredients, farm-to-table kind of vibe, organic meats.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9lisse\u2019s character in the hit Showtime psychological horror series \u201cYellowjackets,\u201d however, has a craving that isn\u2019t so clean: human flesh. In the Season 2 premiere, her character, the teenage version of Shauna, snacks on her dead best friend Jackie\u2019s ear. Later, she leads a bacchanal feast of Jackie\u2019s barbecued corpse. (Don\u2019t worry: The show used jackfruit and rice paper.)",
      "Since the show\u2019s opening scene, \u201cYellowjackets\u201d has foreshadowed its high school soccer team\u2019s descent into cultish ritual and cannibalism; by this week\u2019s episode, the season\u2019s sixth, as a terrified Shauna is forced to give birth in the wild, we\u2019ve already gotten a clear view of what it looks like when the food runs out.",
      "It\u2019s a harrowing, excruciating performance by N\u00e9lisse. As she waddled around the soundstage during production with her prosthetic baby bump, she knew the stakes were high, she said. She cried a lot. But the support from her cast members made the experience easier.",
      "\u201cThey would all come up to me before every day and be like, \u2018Hey, is there anything today we can help you with?\u2019 a little tap on the shoulder, a hug,\u201d she said. Her co-star Samantha Hanratty, who plays Teenage Misty, gave her foot massages.",
      "N\u00e9lisse speaks discursively, excitedly, swallowing all punctuation. She insists she doesn\u2019t like being the center of attention. (\u201cI still get super shy and quirky when introduced to a group,\u201d she said.) But it may be time for her to get used to the limelight. \u201cYellowjackets\u201d has been renewed for a third season, and Showtime has submitted ",
      " in the lead actress category.",
      "Raised in Montreal, N\u00e9lisse, like her character, didn\u2019t have a typical upbringing. She began training competitively for gymnastics at age 4, some days practicing as early as 7 a.m., breaking to attend school and then returning to the mat after, putting in around 30 hours a week. Hoping to offset the costs of coaching, training and competing abroad, she gave acting a try, auditioning for a Montreal agency.",
      "\u201cMaybe if I book anything,\u201d she described hoping at the time, \u201cI\u2019ll make pocket money.\u201d",
      "She did better than that. Like Shauna, she sometimes feels as if she skipped her youth. Her first peck happened on set at age 9; her first real kiss came at 16, again on set. In 2012, she appeared in the Oscar-nominated Canadian movie \u201c",
      ",\u201d which brought her international attention. When, still an adolescent, she landed a major role in the 2013 film \u201c",
      ",\u201d she realized it would take months away from her elite training regime. She decided to commit to acting.",
      "More roles followed. She wouldn\u2019t change anything, she said, but she admits the success came at the expense of some of her innocence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never grown up with kids my age,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been on a set with mostly adults, and I\u2019ve always been told, \u2018You\u2019re so mature.\u2019\u201d",
      "Deprived of their high school ring ceremonies and seasonal dances, the teenage girls in \u201cYellowjackets\u201d are also forced to grow up fast. In Season 1, Shauna plays the timid sidekick to the intrepid team leader, Jackie (Ella Purnell). But after a fight in the season finale drives Jackie into the woods, where she dies of hypothermia, Shauna must struggle to find autonomy as she also struggles with guilt, starvation and the demands of pregnancy.",
      "In a sense, Shauna\u2019s conversations with Jackie become more honest in Season 2. They just happen to be with Jackie\u2019s corpse.",
      "Ashley Lyle, who ",
      " Bart Nickerson, said it felt natural that this intimate friendship would be the show\u2019s entry point into cannibalism.",
      "\u201cI want to be you; I want to destroy you; I love you; I hate you \u2014 all of that could feed into this impulse that she has,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cAnd it allowed us to introduce the actual act of cannibalism through a very specific character.\u201d",
      "As N\u00e9lisse watched Melanie Lynskey portray a restless and clearly traumatized adult version of Shauna, she tried at first to imitate Lynskey\u2019s lip-biting mannerisms but later rejected that approach after it felt inauthentic. (N\u00e9lisse said she had an emotional breakdown after dying her blonde locks brown.)",
      "Lynskey insisted that N\u00e9lisse has a harder shell; N\u00e9lisse would nudge her, she said, to bring more aggression to the role. Ultimately, the two decided to try their best to relate to their characters rather than to each other. Lynskey was moved by N\u00e9lisse\u2019s ability to lean into confrontation and create tension with the viewer \u2014 a stillness juxtaposed with simmering rage that imbues the role with great power.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a very gentle, sweet person, but she definitely has more of a steel core than I do,\u201d Lynskey said.",
      "That steel was vital for the bloody, agonizing Episode 6, in which Shauna is forced to give birth at the winter cabin where all the teenage Yellowjackets are stranded. N\u00e9lisse hadn\u2019t given birth before, so she studied the stories, good and bad, of women who had. Liz Garbus, who directed the episode, instructed N\u00e9lisse to watch hospital videos and birthing scenes from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a show Garbus helped direct, and from \u201cJuno.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9lisse spent days weeping, sweating and screaming. Between takes, she would chug throat-coat tea, with honey and lemon, and try to produce real tears behind her brown-colored contacts. Garbus said she remembered calling cut on set, and the emotional impact the heartbreaking moment \u2014 the baby doesn\u2019t make it \u2014 had on all involved.",
      "\u201cNot just Sophie was crying \u2014 I was crying, and her castmates were crying,\u201d Garbus said. \u201cWe all felt so deeply this horrifying loss and sense of betrayal and fear and grief and anger.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9lisse said she hadn\u2019t expected the baby to survive \u2014 she always prepares for the worst while filming \u201cYellowjackets,\u201d she acknowledged.",
      "Two months after wrapping the wintry Season 2, N\u00e9lisse\u2019s home was struck by an ice storm \u2014 just in time for those 23rd birthday plans. As the power went out for her and ",
      ", she had to improvise, doing her hair and makeup at a friend\u2019s mother\u2019s office in order to get to the restaurant on time.",
      "It wasn\u2019t like starving in a snowbound cabin, but it was perhaps a bit close for comfort. Luckily, no one had resort to cannibalism. But the experience made for some memorable pizza.",
      "\u201cIn the moment it\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I love stories like those because those are the ones that you remember.\u201d"

      "A federal jury found on Thursday that the pop singer Ed Sheeran did not copy Marvin Gaye\u2019s classic \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d for his 2014 hit \u201cThinking Out Loud,\u201d in the music industry\u2019s highest-profile copyright case in years.",
      "Over two weeks in a downtown Manhattan courtroom, Mr. Sheeran, one of music\u2019s ",
      ", testified \u2014 often with a guitar in hand \u2014 that \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d had been created independently one evening with his friend and longtime collaborator Amy Wadge. The song was inspired, he said, by the decades-long loves that he and Ms. Wadge observed among elders in their families.",
      "The two tracks share a similar syncopated chord pattern that the family of Ed Townsend, Gaye\u2019s co-writer, which filed the suit, called the \u201cheart\u201d of \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On.\u201d Mr. Sheeran and his lawyers never denied that the chords in the two songs are similar, but called them commonplace musical building blocks that have\u00a0turned up in dozens of other songs.",
      "The jury, which deliberated for around three hours, found that Mr. Sheeran had created his song independently.",
      "\u201cI am obviously very happy with the outcome of the case,\u201d Mr. Sheeran said in a statement that he read outside the courthouse. \u201cAt the same time, I am unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have spent the last eight years talking about two songs with dramatically different lyrics, melodies and four chords which are also different and used by songwriters every day, all over the world,\u201d Mr. Sheeran continued. \u201cThese chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before \u2018Let\u2019s Get It On\u2019 was written and will be used to make music long after we are all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am just a guy with a guitar who loves writing music for people to enjoy,\u201d he added. \u201cI am not and will never allow myself to be a piggy bank for anyone to shake.\u201d",
      "After the verdict was read shortly after 1 p.m., Mr. Sheeran rose and hugged members of his legal team. He then walked over to Kathryn Griffin Townsend, Mr. Townsend\u2019s daughter, and embraced her too. The two spoke briefly.",
      "After that, Ms. Townsend said that she respected the jury\u2019s decision and that she had defended her father\u2019s legacy.",
      "\u201cI stood up for my father\u2019s intellectual properties,\u201d she said. \u201cI was up against an army.\u201d",
      "The case, which was filed in 2017 and had been delayed in part by the coronavirus pandemic, involved questions of originality in pop music that have been tested in ",
      ", ",
      " among musicians that the line between inspiration and plagiarism was being muddied.",
      "In a 2015 decision that shook the business, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams\u2019s song \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d was ",
      " Gaye\u2019s \u201cGot to Give It Up.\u201d Five years later, the tide turned: ",
      " an appeals court victory over its megahit \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d and the judges provided guidance about how copyright applies to works involving \u201ccommonplace elements.\u201d",
      "In Mr. Sheeran\u2019s case, the plaintiffs argued that even if elements like chords may not be under copyright individually, their \u201cselection and arrangement\u201d on \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d was original and distinctive enough to warrant protection. Mr. Sheeran\u2019s side responded that the plaintiffs\u2019 case did not pass the high legal bar required for such protection.",
      "At times, Mr. Sheeran, who has faced litigation stemming from accusations of copying twice before, grew vexed and combative at the stand.",
      "\u201cTo have someone come in and say, \u2018We don\u2019t believe you, you must have stolen it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sheeran said, \u201cI find that really insulting.\u201d",
      "He insisted that he did not borrow from \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On,\u201d and, playing an acoustic guitar in the witness box, he showed that the chord progression at the core of both tunes, while similar, was not identical.",
      "In \u201cThinking Out Loud,\u201d he testified, the second of the four chords in the progression was major, rejecting a suggestion by Alexander Stewart, a musicologist from the University of Vermont hired by the plaintiffs, that it was similar to a minor one in \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know what I\u2019m playing on guitar,\u201d Mr. Sheeran said. \u201cIt\u2019s me playing the chords.\u201d",
      "Mr. Sheeran also derided Mr. Stewart\u2019s analysis of his vocal melodies \u2014 which included an example with some notes changed \u2014 as \u201ccriminal.\u201d",
      "A quirk of copyright law governed how the jury could hear the two songs. The case involved only the compositions underlying both tracks \u2014 the lyrics, melodies and chords that can be notated on paper \u2014 and not their recordings. For older songs like \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On,\u201d copyright is limited to the sheet music, or \u201cdeposit copy,\u201d that was originally submitted to the United States Copyright Office. On \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On,\u201d that notation was skeletal.",
      "That meant that the jury never heard Gaye\u2019s original recording, which went to No. 1 in 1973. Instead, the defendants supplied a computer-generated re-creation of what appears on the deposit copy, complete with a robotic voice rendering lyrics like \u201cIf you feel like I feel, baby, then come on, let\u2019s get it on.\u201d The studio recording of Mr. Sheeran\u2019s song was heard multiple times.",
      "One of the jurors, Sophia Neis, 23, said after the trial that \u201cthe song as we\u2019re allowed to hear it\u201d and the \u201cdeposit copy\u201d were key pieces of evidence in the jury\u2019s decision making.",
      "\u201cWe ultimately came to what we thought was the right interpretation of the law,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously cool to have anyone play music in front of you live,\u201d she added, of Mr. Sheeran\u2019s decision to play on the stand. \u201cThat was an interesting surprise.\u201d",
      "Ms. Townsend, who often wore a tan-colored coat with the word \u201cintegrity\u201d emblazoned on the back to court, said she had filed her suit to protect her father\u2019s legacy. On Day 3 of the trial, the proceedings were interrupted when she collapsed and was taken to a hospital.",
      "Among Ms. Townsend\u2019s litigators was Ben Crump, who has gained national renown as a civil rights lawyer representing the families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. In his opening statement, he told the jury that the evidence in the case included \u201ca smoking gun\u201d: a fan video showing Mr. Sheeran move seamlessly between \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d at a European concert.",
      "Mr. Sheeran defended his \u201cmash-up\u201d technique, saying he frequently played such medleys in concert, which are made possible by the limited harmonic palette of mainstream pop music. Cradling his guitar, he demonstrated for the jury.",
      "\u201cMost pop songs can fit over most pop songs,\u201d Mr. Sheeran said. \u201cYou could go from \u2018Let It Be\u2019 to \u2018No Woman, No Cry\u2019 and switch back.\u201d",
      "In addition to Ms. Townsend, the plaintiffs in the case were a trust for Helen McDonald, Mr. Townsend\u2019s sister, who died after the case was filed, and the estate of Cherrigale Townsend, his former wife.",
      "Besides Mr. Sheeran, the defendants included his label, Atlantic Records, and his publisher, Sony Music Publishing.",
      "For the wider music industry, Mr. Sheeran\u2019s victory preserves a status quo about copyright. After the disruption of the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d case, many commentators viewed Led Zeppelin\u2019s win as ",
      ". Katy Perry and her collaborators on the song \u201cDark Horse\u201d were immediate beneficiaries of that ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a win for all songwriters, including the next Ed Townsend and the next Marvin Gaye,\u201d said Jennifer Jenkins, a law professor at Duke who specializes in music copyright. \u201cThe copyright over the original, creative features of \u2018Let\u2019s Get It On\u2019 remains intact, but this verdict frees up the scaffolding it was built upon.\u201d",
      "After the verdict was read, Ms. Townsend said that she was glad to finally have the opportunity to speak one-on-one with Mr. Sheeran, and that he had invited her to a show on his tour, which opens on Saturday. \u201cIf we had been able to just talk,\u201d she said, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d",

      "Held annually at the Royal Academy in London, the exhibition gives amateurs a chance to see their efforts displayed alongside paintings and sculpture by world famous artists. Thousands of Britons submit works each year. Almost all of them are rejected.",
      "Carrick\u2019s piece was simple and traditional \u2014 a tiny watercolor of farmhouses and a few trees beneath a pale blue sky \u2014 but the show\u2019s curators clearly saw something special in it. They chose it over 12,250 other entries to go into the show.",
      "What the curators didn\u2019t know was that they\u2019d been deceived. \u201cArthur George Carrick\u201d was a pseudonym. The real painter was the man who on Saturday will be crowned as Britain\u2019s king.",
      "Throughout his life, King Charles III has involved himself in British cultural life, not only a maker of art but as an avid spectator and patron.",
      "In Britain, the king is often portrayed as a cultural traditionalist, because of his well-known love of classical architecture, and some of his passions chime with that image: He has ",

      " and The Three Degrees, a Philadelphia soul act.",
      "With these varied interests, Charles is the most culturally attuned monarch for well over a century. If Queen Elizabeth II, ",
      ", was more interested in horse racing than the thousands of performances she sat through during her reign, Charles\u2019s fascination with the arts and entertainment echoes the concerns of several much earlier holders of the throne.",

His son, Charles II, reopened Britain\u2019s theaters after puritan insurgents forced their lengthy closure, and laid the groundwork for what is today\u2019s West End.

      "But where previous monarchs were known for their passions, Charles has often been defined by the things he doesn\u2019t like. Starting in the 1980s when he was Prince of Wales, Charles used speeches, books and television programs to repeatedly ",
      " and promote alternatives based on classical forms. On several occasions, he intervened directly seeking to halt glass-and-steel building projects. In the process, he\u2019s courted the ire of British architects, some of whom have labeled his meddling unconstitutional.",
      "On Saturday, the king\u2019s love of music will be on full display. He has commissioned 12 works for the coronation ceremony, including an \u201cAgnus Dei\u201d for choir by the London-born American composer Tarik O\u2019Regan. In a phone interview, O\u2019Regan said that once you \u201cdelved into Charles\u2019s likes and dislikes,\u201d a picture emerged of a man whose interests were \u201cobviously nuanced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s someone who is clearly very affected by music and other arts,\u201d O\u2019Regan said.",

      ", who took him to the Royal Opera House in London to see his first ballet at age 7. \u201cI remember being so completely transfixed by the magic of it,\u201d Charles ",
      "The Queen Mother also encouraged Charles\u2019s love of classical music and the future monarch learned the trumpet in his boarding school orchestra. Charles recalled that he thought he was doing well at the instrument until a teacher interrupted a rehearsal by shouting, \u201cThose trumpets! Stop those trumpets!\u201d He switched to playing cello.",

He often attends the opera and ballet in London \u2014 a spokesman for the Royal Opera House said the king visited last month in a private capacity \u2014 and regularly watches Royal Shakespeare Company productions at the theater group\u2019s home in Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

      "He received no formal art training, according to the documentary, and taught himself to paint in watercolors. By the time Charles secretly entered his work into the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, in 1987, he had been making pictures of rural scenes and royal residences for decades.

      "Charles has also paid for artists to accompany him on foreign tours, producing records of the events that are added to the royal art collection. ",
      ", a figurative painter who went with Charles on a 2014 tour of Mexico and Colombia, said that he was told to paint whatever he liked, though courtiers urged him to include Charles in the pictures. Kelley said he sketched street scenes and a temple visit \u2014 \u201cnothing outlandish or avant-garde,\u201d he said.",

This causes an important number of artists from all over Brazil to migrate here.

      "Miami is a city that\u2019s hard to pin down. Blame the immigrants. Blame the tourists. Blame the tech bros. To love Miami is to accept that it is, and always will be, a city in flux. You blink and the skyline changes. (Blame the developers.) Even as it grows increasingly apparent that Miami will be gobbled up by the sea, a new wave of transplants is ever en route.",
      "Miami residents who were \u201cmade in Dade\u201d carry their heritage on their sleeves, and it informs their writing beautifully. But some of the best stories set in Miami begin elsewhere: in Puerto Rico and Cuba, the Deep South and New England. I expect this will continue to be the case. Even now, a Californian couple is conceiving the Miami writer who will begin his novel, \u201cMy people escaped Palo Alto.\u201d",
      "To set the mood, and to prepare for your impending immersion in our majority minority city, read Russell Banks\u2019s \u201c",
      " Few novelists have attempted to capture Miami\u2019s various cultures \u2014 and cultural collisions \u2014 with the seriousness and empathy that Banks employs in his sweeping epic",
      " The novel follows a New Englander who moves to Florida and gets involved in human trafficking. Meanwhile, in a parallel narrative, a Haitian woman seeks to start a better life in the United States.",
      "The book is ambitious in its attempts to represent the language and attitudes of Haitians, Jamaicans, Cubans and many other Caribbean peoples, alongside Black and white Americans of various social classes. The beauty of the novel \u2014 and perhaps the beauty of Miami \u2014 is how it destabilizes our ideas about who is foreign and who belongs.",
      "Next, read \u201c",
      ",\u201d Jaquira D\u00edaz\u2019s astonishing memoir about her tumultuous upbringing. Primarily set in the 1990s, the book draws a precise visual of Miami Beach and its outer reaches from the insider\u2019s perspective. Readers might be tempted to use it as a ",
      ", following young Jaqui from South Beach\u2019s lifeguard stations across Ocean Drive toward Lincoln Road\u2019s pedestrian-only promenade. Shop and dine, then climb aboard the express bus downtown and, in no time, you\u2019ll arrive at Bayside Marketplace, where you can board a party boat and drink your life away \u2014 like an absolute tourist, or like a teenager who would rather be anywhere than home battling her schizophrenic mother.",
      "D\u00edaz also takes readers where tourists probably won\u2019t want to go: to parks infamous for having hidden dead girls\u2019 bodies; to street corner beatdowns and repeat trips to the Miami Beach precinct; to back alleys and locker rooms and apartment bathrooms where men lurk, always expectantly, always to take, take, take all they can from young women. There\u2019s much trauma in these pages, but also much triumph, including in the fact that this book came to exist. Readers will feel buoyed by the energetic prose, and by the warm depictions of the female friendships that carried D\u00edaz through some of her most difficult moments.",

The book delves into the major events that brought the Black American and Bahamian work force to the area shortly before the city became incorporated in 1896, then carries readers through the trials and victories of the next hundred years.

      "can help fill you in. The book includes the influential people who became Miami\u2019s historic figures \u2014 the ones whose names still mark our highways \u2014 but it centers the community of people who literally carved out Miami\u2019s streets.",

      "This strip of coastal territory at India\u2019s southern tip, 350 miles long and 75 miles broad at its widest point, is shaped like a fish, with the head pointing to Sri Lanka, the tail to Goa, and the eyes gazing wistfully west across the Indian Ocean to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia \u2014 the Gulf, or Persia in local parlance.",
      "Think of the Gulf as a Kerala annex, since three million Keralites \u2014 or Malayalis, speakers of Malayalam \u2014 work there; the money they send home makes up about a third of the state\u2019s gross domestic product. Not surprisingly, the Gulf has shaped Kerala\u2019s culture and literature. The territory sits between the Indian Ocean and the Western Ghats, the mountain range that runs parallel to the coast. Forty-four rivers run to the sea, spawning vast lakes, countless streams, lagoons, bottle-green lotus ponds and a latticework of backwaters that are Kerala\u2019s giant circulatory system, with the annual monsoon its beating heart.",
      "Such liquid abundance shapes the lush green landscape dotted with palm trees, and also shapes Malayali character. I think it\u2019s responsible for the fluid facial movements that allow Malayalis to convey volumes without uttering a word.",
      "Kerala\u2019s uniqueness developed in part because the towering Western Ghats sheltered the state from invaders from the north, while the mountains\u2019 fertile slopes allowed spices such as pepper and cardamom to grow wild. For centuries, Arab sailors caught the southwesterlies in the lateen sails of their dhows to come to the \u201cSpice Coast.\u201d When the winds reversed, they carried their purchases of pepper, clove, cardamom, ginger and cinnamon back to Venice or Genoa, where they sold them for small fortunes. Naturally, these sailors kept their source a secret from Europeans.",
      "Expeditions by Westerners in search of these precious spices all failed until Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, landed in present day Kerala in 1498. He was the first; the Portuguese were soon followed by the Dutch, the French and the English.",
      "Books on Kerala\u2019s history can feel tedious. A first-time traveler is better off with a broader introduction to India, like V.S. Naipaul\u2019s incisive and inimitable \u201c",

      "Inevitably, two centuries of British colonization have left a mark in complex ways, including the irony that many Indian writers \u2014 including Tharoor, and the author of this article \u2014 were educated in schools and universities modeled on the British system, and write and think in English.",

      "In the giant spice warehouses, you\u2019ll see sellers and buyers bartering next to mountains of pepper and cloves, much as they did centuries ago in the absence of a common language: by clasping hands under a towel while their concealed fingers convey bids and counter bids, hidden from the other buyers. For further enlightenment, read \u201c",

It\u2019s a mystery to me why Europeans in the first sweeping spice craze never thought to pound, dry-roast, then saut\u00e9 these treasures with onions and garlic to make a masala. Instead, they used them as preservatives, to conceal body odors and even, as one zealot championed, to rub on the flaccid male organ, which he swore changed its state and provided endless satisfaction for his partner. (Please don\u2019t try this at home.)",

      "Old family stories are hard to revivify, even when they\u2019re good family stories. Nothing fades faster, and is more elusive, than the motivations of people who lived a long time ago, unless they were famous enough to leave a churning wake behind them or wrote honest, plucky memoirs of their own.",
      "This is the problem Ava Chin is up against in her sensitive, ambitious, well-reported, heavily peopled yet curiously remote memoir-cum-history, \u201cMott Street: A Chinese American Family\u2019s Story of Exclusion and Homecoming.\u201d It\u2019s a book that has everything going for it except that intangible spark that crisp and confident storytelling throws off. The air is a bit still in this book, as if one is walking behind the docent on a long museum tour.",
      "Chin\u2019s memoir takes its title from the narrow north-south road in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown that\u2019s generally thought of as its Main Street, to which Chin\u2019s family has a long and intricate and prosperous connection. Members of both sides were born, established businesses, ate, drank and died there. Many lived in the same building.",
      "When she\u2019s on Mott Street, Chin feels she\u2019s at home \u2014 except when she feels like an out-and-out alien (she can\u2019t decide) because she and her mother were abandoned by her father and driven from the home place.",
      "Chin grew up in Flushing, Queens, before its Chinese-immigrant population surpassed that of Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. She was a latchkey kid, raised in part by her grandparents. She was among the few Asians in her schools.",
      "She began to sense that there was a side of her family that no one talked about. \u201cMott Street\u201d opens with her meeting her long-distant father, a wealthy lawyer and handsome former politician named Stanley Chin. About him, Chin\u2019s grandmother had told her, \u201cHe used your mother, then threw her away.\u201d",
      "Father and daughter never establish much of a connection, but the author begins to pull other threads of her family\u2019s past and present. A lot of material comes loose.",
      "\u201cMott Street\u201d is a big book that scrutinizes four generations of her family\u2019s life. It has a great deal to say about the Chinese experience in this country: the perilous journeys here, the racism that forced many into menial railroad and laundry jobs, and the draconian Chinese exclusion laws that for six decades (1882-1943) halted most legal immigration and blocked Chinese people from citizenship.",
      "The story has a certain pageantry. It flexes to absorb world wars, cholera epidemics,",
      "the San Francisco earthquake (the loss of official documents in flattened buildings was a boon to many Chinese immigrants), sensational crimes, foot binding and the rise of urban tongs, warring social groups that some would compare to the mafia.",
      "There is a roll call of American politicians who hurt, and helped, the Chinese American cause. There is a great deal of writing about the consolations of food \u2014 the author\u2019s previous book was \u201cEating Wildly: Foraging for Life, Love and the Perfect Meal\u201d (2014) \u2014 and an analysis of how American Jews became so fond of Chinese cuisines. ",
      "There are so many relatives in these pages that readers will find themselves frequently referring to the family tree in front. A few primary faces emerge.",
      "One is Chin On, the author\u2019s paternal great-grandfather, who arrived here in the 1890s. He had swagger, the \u201ckind of arrogance and flair that would later become known as a distinctively Chin quality,\u201d Chin writes.",
      "He was a violent, amoral, heavy-drinking man, a gambling high-roller who owned or co-owned nightclubs and pool halls and opium dens and brothels. Woe to those who borrowed money from him and could not pay it back. One of Chin On\u2019s heavies carried a hatchet and, in Sweeney Todd fashion, was \u201cnever hesitant to turn an enemy of the family into human pork.\u201d The toxic male may be on the run in America, but as dramatis personae he remains a close-to-indispensable spice.",
      "Excellent to read about, too, is Wu Doshim, a maternal relative. Around the turn of the last century he edited The Chinese Reform Weekly News, one of the first Chinese-language newspapers in New York. He had to work linguistic miracles because he had only about 7,000 pieces of metal type in Chinese, while most metropolitan Chinese papers used more than 30,000. He must have felt the way Georges Perec did when he wrote a novel without using the letter \u201ce.\u201d",
      "The women tended to leave less plentiful paper trails, but Chin painstakingly brings several to life. One is Wu Doshim\u2019s wife, Cheung To Chun, who was a member of the darker-skinned and persecuted Hakka ethnic group. Chun experienced racism at the hands of other Chinese Americans,",
      "and lived most her life here undocumented.",
      "Another is Elva Lisk, the white daughter of a Civil War veteran who married into Chin\u2019s maternal family. Elva had both male and female sex organs, Chin writes. Here and throughout the book, Chin places imagined dialogue, in italics, into her text. (There are imagined sex scenes as well.) This dialogue verges on the mawkish: \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "This memoir evokes emotion but, as with the made-up dialogue, Chin sometimes doesn\u2019t trust her readers to absorb it on their own.

    "name": "Craving Beauty, but at What Cost?",

      ", by Katy Kelleher",
      "Activities that we tend to think of as distinctly human often have nothing to do with immediate survival. We brush paint on canvases, we play tunes on instruments, we imagine a world that doesn\u2019t exist and read about the fictitious people who live there. But sometimes the human pursuit of joy and pleasure can create destruction. We have a hard time abiding by the concept of enough. We recklessly and relentlessly chase things we want but do not need.",
      "In \u201cThe Ugly History of Beautiful Things,\u201d Katy Kelleher writes about the extreme and sometimes hideous lengths that people have gone to in order to obtain coveted objects of beauty: ruining their health, wrecking the planet, inflicting suffering on others. As someone with a history of depression that has entailed self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she says that beauty has helped provide the purpose to keep her going: \u201cThe hope for beauty makes me leave my bed each morning rather than moldering in the sheets until I develop bedsores.\u201d",
      "Yet the beauty she seeks is also tied up with feelings of guilt. \u201cI\u2019ve never found an object that was untouched by the depravity of human greed or unblemished by the chemical undoings of time,\u201d Kelleher writes. She buys trinkets and generates garbage. A journalist who writes about home and design, she realizes that it has been her job to encourage others to do the same.",
      "Thankfully, this book isn\u2019t her penance \u2014 it\u2019s more surprising and ambivalent than that, and there isn\u2019t any scolding here, even if some of what she recounts is disturbing and truly horrific. Kelleher points out that an element of ugliness can be part of an object\u2019s appeal, distinguishing between the intriguingly beautiful and the boringly pretty. There is, of course, the Japanese notion of wabi-sabi, which holds that imperfection can be a reminder of life\u2019s impermanence and contingency; a decaying flower might convey another layer of experience that a fresh bloom won\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t explicitly mention Japanese aesthetics, but a chapter on the Nazi fetish for gleaming white porcelain had me rereading Tanizaki\u2019s \u201cIn Praise of Shadows,\u201d in which he writes about wanting a toilet made of black lacquered wood.",
      "But an ugly history is different. Knowledge of it can detract from an object\u2019s allure even as it signals the object\u2019s desirability \u2014 making it glaringly clear how rare something is, and therefore how scarcity has helped to determine its value. In the 19th century, an orchid hunter might have been eaten by a tiger or disappeared forever somewhere in the jungle thicket. During the Renaissance, Venetian glassmakers often worked with toxic materials like lead and mercury; those who didn\u2019t go mad from the vapors or die from mysterious stomach ailments would still have to worry about being assassinated by glassmaking rivals or, should they try to emigrate, by their autocratic rulers.",
      "The mirrors that these glassmakers so painstakingly created have since achieved the status of mass-produced goods, part of a system that has eliminated some hazards while generating others. Mirrors used to be rare and prized enough to be associated with scrying and magic; now, Kelleher laments, they\u2019re so common that they\u2019re taken for granted, or else derided as mere objects of vanity instead of marvelous contraptions that allowed for the \u201csense of awe\u201d that comes with seeing oneself.",
      "Kelleher organizes her book by object, with chapters on gemstones (shadowed by violence), on makeup (shadowed by toxicity), on perfume (shadowed by animal excretions), among others. She has a knack for nimbly threading together her own memories and tastes with the histories of the objects themselves. She doesn\u2019t want cruelty in her goods, and so she fills vases with foraged greenery and buys a silk dress secondhand. \u201cI wanted to feel a fabric that skims over my skin like breeze,\u201d she explains. \u201cHave you ever slipped a silk robe around your body and felt it brush against your nipples?\u201d",
      "Most people in the world would undoubtedly answer no; silk is still a luxury good, even if it\u2019s been made more accessible by exploitative labor practices. Kelleher wrestles with some of these knotty issues, though her enthusiasm is most palpable when she is writing about the goods themselves. We yearn for beautiful things that give us sensual pleasure \u2014 that seems obvious enough. But a luxury good \u201cwas never intended to be available to everyone,\u201d she writes \u2014 that also seems obvious. So what are the implications of this? Not everyone who wants to feel the caress of a silk robe can afford it, especially if it\u2019s ethically made. Should you rein in your desires? Or does that amount to letting the elite off the hook: They do what they wish, while the rest of us make do with what we can get?",
      "It\u2019s a lot of pressure to put on a flimsy robe, but as Kelleher knows, you can\u2019t write about this stuff without at least gesturing at the bigger stuff: existence and mortality, capitalism and consumption. By the end of the book, she comes to a d\u00e9tente with her own yearning. She recognizes that she can appreciate beauty without possessing it \u2014 she can take her daughter to the beach and make mandalas out of shell fragments; she can go for a walk and spot a monarch butterfly in a field or a pink orchid in a bog. But she admits that she still longs for a fantasy home with marble countertops and slate tiles, even if her conscience and her bank account make it an impossibility.",
      "\u201cEach beauty I find will fade, degrade, break and tarnish,\u201d Kelleher writes, \u201cand there\u2019s no point in asking for what I can\u2019t have.\u201d",

      " and ",

      "Well, somebody was going to do it. In truth, other hustlers out there on Amazon already have. But \u201cDeath of an Author\u201d is arguably the first halfway readable A.I. novel, an early glimpse at what is vectoring toward readers. It has been presided over by a literate writer who has pushed the borg in twisty directions. He got it to spit out more than boilerplate, some of the time.

The prose mostly has the crabwise gait of a Wikipedia entry. If this novel could exhale, its breath would surely smell, to borrow words from Ian McEwan in his novel \u201cMachines Like Me,\u201d like the back of a warm TV set.",
      "What\u2019s interesting are the moments when you sense Marche pushing the A.I., like Wendy Carlos bent over her Moog synthesizer, or a kid rocking a pinball machine, to go deeper. Firmin predicts, for example, where we might be in a few years with this technology:",

He lit the fuse, parked the truck and walked to his getaway car in a nearby alley. The blast sheared off the front third of the building, killing 167 people, 19 of them children. (Another victim, a rescue worker, was killed by falling debris.) Among the dead were 15 preschoolers who had just started their morning at the day care center on the second floor.",

      ", who have convincingly depicted Oklahoma City as both a culmination and a turning point. McVeigh was a decorated veteran of Operation Desert Storm who drew his bombing plans directly from ",
      " a 1978 novel by a neo-Nazi that narrated a lurid fantasy of race war. He referred to his attack as a \u201cmilitary action\u201d and attended militia meetings. Contrary to media portrayals of him at the time, McVeigh wasn\u2019t just some lone-wolf drifter or survivalist oddball. He was steeped in an ideology; he was motivated by a political movement.",
      "Jeffrey Toobin\u2019s \u201cHomegrown\u201d adds to this chorus, but where those other books contain a chapter on Oklahoma City, the entirety of Toobin\u2019s book is given over to McVeigh and the ensuing trials. Toobin covered the legal proceedings for The New Yorker, and he admits that like other journalists he got caught up in \u201cthe trail of evidence presented in the courtroom,\u201d instead of stepping back to grasp McVeigh\u2019s \u201cplace in the broader slipstream of American history.\u201d",
      "Part of the reason, he suggests, lies with how the government decided to prosecute the case \u2014 or, more specifically, how Merrick Garland, the official sent by the Justice Department to supervise the case, decided to prosecute it. Garland was so intent on pruning away anything resembling \u201cclutter\u201d that \u201cthe idea took hold that the bombing was just about Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols,\u201d McVeigh\u2019s co-conspirator.",
      "The first half of the book recounts the events leading up to the bombing in Toobin\u2019s unfussy prose. We read about McVeigh\u2019s \u201ctroubled, but hardly extraordinary upbringing\u201d near Buffalo \u2014 divorced parents (\u201chis rage at his mother was intense\u201d), a father whose job at a radiator plant became increasingly precarious. Toobin describes an arrogant, lonely kid who constantly deflected responsibility, loath to own up to his failures. By the time he met Nichols during basic training in 1988, McVeigh had already found the two things that would provoke in him a fanatical devotion: \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d and guns.",
      "McVeigh would go on to become a regular at gun shows, eventually cajoling Nichols into robbing a dealer so that they could fund their bombing plot. Oklahoma City would be their response to Ruby Ridge, to Waco, to the assault weapons ban of 1994. (McVeigh compared the ban to \u201cthe Cohen Act,\u201d the gun control law in \u201cThe Turner Diaries.\u201d) In other words, the federal government made them do it: McVeigh, who wanted to take credit for the attack while also wanting to be acquitted, at one point urged his legal team to pursue a \u201cnecessity defense\u201d by arguing that the bombing was done to prevent greater harm.",
      "\u201cThe argument was worse than nonsensical,\u201d Toobin writes. \u201cIt was offensive.\u201d McVeigh\u2019s lawyers recognized as much. But all kinds of absurd ideas were entertained by the members of his legal team because they had an essentially unlimited budget, at government expense; the procedure-obsessed Garland wanted to pre-empt any criticism that McVeigh\u2019s right to a robust defense had been compromised.",
      "\u201cHomegrown\u201d repeatedly draws a \u201cdirect line\u201d (as promised on the jacket copy) between the Oklahoma City bombing and the insurrection on Jan. 6; at multiple points Toobin interrupts his brisk narrative with some galumphing sentences reminding the reader of parallels that are glaringly obvious. The more intriguing parts of the book come from his descriptions of all the legal wrangling, much of it informed by 635 boxes of case files donated by Stephen Jones, McVeigh\u2019s showboating attorney, to the University of Texas in 1999. Toobin describes how the lawyer and his client grew to dislike and mistrust each other. After McVeigh criticized Jones in \u201cAmerican Terrorist,\u201d a book by two Buffalo News reporters, Jones claimed \u201ca right to defend himself by disclosing his client\u2019s confidences.\u201d",
      "Still, the lawyer who interests Toobin most is Garland \u2014 another point in the \u201cdirect line\u201d between Oklahoma City and Jan. 6. Back then, Garland was a top official in the Justice Department; now, of course, he is the attorney general of the United States. Toobin, ",
      ", calls him \u201ca reticent, cautious person\u201d who was haunted by the \u201cundignified spectacle\u201d of the O.J. Simpson trial (which Toobin wrote a ",
      " about).",
      "Vowing that the Oklahoma City trials would never devolve into silly theatrics, Garland wanted the case to hew as closely to McVeigh and Nichols as possible. So the prosecution \u201cactively discouraged the idea that McVeigh and Nichols represented something broader \u2014 and more enduring \u2014 than just their own malevolent behavior,\u201d Toobin writes. \u201cThis was a dangerously misleading impression.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if Toobin were addressing his book to Garland, as a cautionary tale, even if Garland\u2019s legal strategy in Oklahoma ultimately proved successful: McVeigh was ",
      " and executed in June 2001; Nichols was sentenced to ",
      ".",
      "Besides, if Merrick Garland had sounded an alarm, would that really have had a transformative effect on the American public? Even Toobin has to concede that the 1990s felt like a very different time: \u201cAmerica was thriving, so how could McVeigh be anything except a regrettable oddity in this moment of national repose?\u201d The fringe was still the fringe \u2014 it was too extreme, too weird, too atomized to coalesce into anything that could get its hands on actual power. Social media didn\u2019t exist; Trump was still known primarily for his florid love life and gaudy casinos. Chilling what-ifs have since become routine facts in our warped reality: \u201cMcVeigh would talk about his belief that an \u2018Army\u2019 of fellow believers was somewhere out there, but he admitted that he never figured out how to reach them.\u201d",

      " by Abraham Verghese",
      "Abraham Verghese occupies a curious place in the modern literary landscape. A doctor who decided midcareer to train at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, he has gone on to achieve distinction in both fields. He is a professor of the theory and practice of medicine at Stanford Medical School, continues in clinical practice, has won the National Humanities Medal, speaks widely about the importance of the human element of what has become a technocratic practice, and has won awards for both fiction and nonfiction. His last novel, \u201cCutting for Stone,\u201d spent more than two years on this newspaper\u2019s best-seller list.",
      "It is tempting to look at him as a man with multiple careers running in tandem, but all his work is anchored in a consistent, profound moral architecture of the spirit. He suffered considerably when he was younger \u2014 experiences he has chronicled in his earlier fiction and nonfiction \u2014 and emerged a romantic, determined to be kind and extravagantly compassionate, a genuine humanist. In an era when seriousness is often presumed to entail skepticism, he is serious about benevolence. By projecting his own best self, he hopes to coax out the best selves of others.",
      "It is hard to operate consistently on such high principles, harder still to explain them to others, and hardest of all to demand that others rise to them. The modesty of ostentatiously kindhearted people can come off as smug, and in his public statements, Verghese occasionally assumes a bothersome tone of condescension. His new novel, \u201cThe Covenant of Water,\u201d focuses almost entirely on good people (to whom many terrible things happen), and given the complexity of human beings, the surfeit of grace sometimes feels unrealistic and even pretentious, as though the writer is affiliating himself with standards that ordinary humans cannot attain. The lack of ill intent or even ambivalence among the book\u2019s many heroes can become cloying. This is not a novel endowed with subtle psychological insights, and it is devoid of humor: on the part of the characters or about them.",
      "It is, however, grand, spectacular, sweeping and utterly absorbing. ",
      " has a gift for suspense, and his easy relationship to language draws you through the narrative so effortlessly that you hardly realize you are plowing through decade upon decade and page upon page. The book begins in 1900, as a 12-year-old girl in what is now the state of Kerala, in southwest India, prepares for an unwanted arranged marriage. It ends in 1977, when that girl\u2019s physician granddaughter arrives at a shocking discovery. The family are Indian Christians, descendants of those first converted by St. Thomas in the first century A.D. They lead tough but often joyful lives, and they gradually make their way up in the world despite impossible-looking challenges. A plot synopsis would take a hundred pages and spoil the fun, but let it be known that this family loves and suffers in a cavalcade of ways.",
      "The tone of the book is sometimes pedagogical: There are a lot of doctors here, and we learn in rather fine detail about surgical procedures, anatomical constructions and medical interventions. Verghese\u2019s writing about all things medical is particularly adroit; his profound understanding of the human body is perhaps his greatest strength. Even if the personalities of the numerous physicians are not fully rounded, their identities as doctors are. We also learn a great deal about India, some of which we might already have known: the caste system; the social upheavals of the 20th century; a variety of foods; information about architecture, farming and family structure; the place of faith in the society; the eventual move toward socialism.",
      "Like Amy Tan\u2019s \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d which catered to a voyeuristic interest in Asia by selecting its most accessibly endearing characteristics, this novel recalls the curry one might get in a small American farm town: exotic by local standards, not wrong in any way, but substantially softened for the locals. Some of the exposition can seem almost patronizing to a more worldly reader. The view of India does not achieve the plangent intimacy that, for example, Vikram Seth achieves in \u201cA Suitable Boy.\u201d This is populist writing, ambitious in plot but not in character, and populated with archetypes rather than people. So, in many ways, was the work of Charles Dickens, whose crackling but now rather historical method of storytelling may be among Verghese\u2019s inspirations.",
      "Yet why should we assume that sophistication requires cynicism? Sometimes it is satisfying when good things happen to good people, when the nastiness that has tended to reap rewards in the harsh world of modern fiction takes a break. People may not be as good as Verghese\u2019s characters, but neither are they as bad as Philip Roth\u2019s or Saul Bellow\u2019s. Ugliness is not truer than loveliness, nor cruelty more so than kindness. Sometimes, the world\u2019s insults are simple ones: a child who dies, a fire, a disease, a flood. There is pungent truth outside of malice.",
      "This book may follow \u201cCutting for Stone\u201d onto the best-seller list and stay there for a long time. It does not present the dark and fantastical complexity of India limned by Salman Rushdie in \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children,\u201d and its occasional gestures toward the mystical feel contrived. Still, it will expose people without much connection to South Asian culture to beauties to which they might otherwise not have access. In a period of divisiveness, racism and anti-Asian hate, that is as important an accomplishment as changing our understanding of what fiction can do, or explaining how the world\u2019s largest democracy came to elect Narendra Modi, or delving into the anti-Islamic face of Hindu nationalism. The arranged marriage that begins the book is a happy one; many are not, and the status of women in rural India remains often problematic; that should not, however, undermine the reality that such marriages succeed at least as often as those predicated on romance.",
      "The trick is to read the book not as realism, but as a fable. The impetus to write it began with a notebook that Verghese\u2019s mother wrote for an inquisitive granddaughter, and the earlier parts of \u201cThe Covenant of Water\u201d have the soothing haze of sentimental recollection. Even as the book moves toward more recent times, when Verghese himself was alive, and begins to express some awareness of a troubled world, its plot is so thick with extremes and unlikely coincidences, so highly wrought, so dense with drama, that it doesn\u2019t feel real. But it doesn\u2019t need to. Verghese has given us entry to Cochin and Travancore as they once existed or never did, and to a family whose saga is full of grief and yet oddly reassuring.",
      "The great novels about India by Indian expatriates are often traumatic to read. This one is not a literary accomplishment at the level of Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s \u201cThe Namesake\u201d or Arundhati Roy\u2019s \u201cThe God of Small Things\u201d; nonetheless, I would happily spend months on end with it and I cried when it was done. While I don\u2019t entirely believe in Verghese\u2019s characters, I am moved by how much he loves them and, in so doing, makes the reader love them. At this moment, I am longing to go to Kerala; I am as nostalgic for Big Ammachi as I am for my own grandmother. It is a better world for having a book in it that chronicles so many tragedies in a tone that never deviates from hope.",

      ": You don\u2019t need to travel too far afield for ideas. Some of the best material is close to home.",
      "The poet and memoirist \u2014 not to be confused with Maggie Smith, the dowager countess of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d \u2014 has built a career on inspiration drawn from her neighborhood in Bexley, Ohio, only 25 minutes from her childhood home in Westerville. \u201cI don\u2019t live here necessarily because of the place; I live here because my people are here,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cMy parents are here, my sisters are here, my aunts and uncles are here. We have dinner at my childhood home every Sunday.\u201d",
      "In her memoir, \u201cYou Could Make This Place Beautiful,\u201d which debuted at No. 3 on the hardcover nonfiction list, Smith takes readers inside the 1,500-square-foot ",
      " she shares with her daughter and son. Her husband used to live there too; the dissolution of their marriage is the foundation of \u201cYou Could Make This Place Beautiful\u201d and Smith\u2019s last book, \u201cKeep Moving.\u201d (The walls and the roof of both are a composite of creativity, motherhood and determination.)",
      "\u201cThe major stressor in my life was how was I going to stay in this house, in this neighborhood, in these schools, with these people,\u201d Smith said. She writes in her memoir, \u201cI kept us here with words\u201d \u2014 specifically, the advance for \u201cKeep Moving.\u201d",
      "The place has 35 windows, give or take, and lots of natural light. Smith\u2019s office looks out on the street, with views in all directions. She said, \u201cI am literally the last person my kids see when they go off to school. I see them coming home because I\u2019m sitting in this office, watching them come up the front walk.\u201d",
      "Smith acknowledged that she\u2019s living \u201cin a glass house in lots of metaphorical ways,\u201d but the visibility seems to be working out. Friends leave flowers, pastries and books on her front porch. A neighbor obligingly turned off his chain saw when he found out that she had a Zoom book event.",
      "\u201cReally what it feels like is being held in this place,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Would her Kerouac-loving 16-year-old self be appalled at the prospect of a future in Bexley? Possibly. \u201cI had wild capers planned,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to get out and have my great adventure.\u201d",
      "But, as she writes, \u201cLiving in Ohio my whole life, in the heart of the heart, and living in the same house where we once lived together, is like living inside a repetitive poem \u2014 a pantoum, a villanelle, a ghazal. There are always words and lines repeating, carrying forward, insisting on themselves.\u201d"

      "The title of Tara Ison\u2019s ",
      "comes",
      "from a French expression for twilight. Sure enough, her novel sends us to the dusk that borders the familiar and the wild, the known and the unknown. It\u2019s where our beliefs and suspicions can cast dark shadows over our lives. And, of course, the lives of others.",
      "It\u2019s March 1941 in German-occupied northern France when we\u2019re introduced to 12-year-old Marie-Jeanne Chantier, an orphan who has come to stay with her aunt and uncle, Berthe and Claude, and her older cousin, Luc. But Marie-Jeanne is actually Danielle Marton, a Jewish child smuggled out of Paris by her recently widowed mother. And Berthe and Claude are actually her grandparents\u2019 former maid and butler. They will provide her with an alternate identity, but in the dangerous atmosphere of a rural village loyal to the collaborationist Vichy regime, what is false will slowly acquire the insidious certainty of truth.",
      "Danielle\u2019s conversion to true-believer Marie-Jeanne is all in the details: from the terror of her first church service (how can she take communion \u201cif she and Marie-Jeanne have two different Gods?\u201d) to her puzzlement over a teacher\u2019s reaction to an essay (Joan of Arc can\u2019t drive out \u201cthe evil foreign invader\u201d because that might be seen as a reference to the Germans). More disturbing is her unquestioning acceptance of the removal of her best friend, Genevieve, to an internment camp when those identified as Jews are swept from the community. With the passage of time, Marie-Jeanne\u2019s staunch new convictions may come to threaten certain members of her adopted family. And what about her old one? As the Allied victories increase, so do the retreating Germans\u2019 vicious reprisals. Inevitably, another question arises: \u201cWhy was she still alive?\u201d",
      "Communal beliefs are also eloquently probed in Fiona McFarlane\u2019s ",
      "which is set in the harsh back country of South Australia in the early 1880s. The novel\u2019s plot pivots around the search for a 6-year-old boy who has gone missing in a dust storm. Young Denny lives just outside the newly settled town of Fairly and, as his absence stretches from one day to the next and then the next, the tensions beneath the surface of this fledgling society become more apparent.",
      "Denny\u2019s father is barely hanging onto his wheat farm and the best tracker in the region is employed by the wealthiest landowners, whose priorities lie elsewhere. The official hunt is led by the local authorities, but Denny\u2019s father and his headstrong sister Cissy have their own theories about where he might be. Providing different perspectives are a vagabonding Swedish artist and his British wife as well as an Aboriginal wrangler called Billy, whose skill as a cricket batsman has blighted his connection to his family traditions.",
      "Billy is perfectly positioned to reflect on the region\u2019s many divisions \u2014 not just between the people but between the people and the countryside they inhabit. To Denny\u2019s father, half his acreage is just a desert of \u201csaltbush and dry soil and every fly that ever bothered God.\u201d But to Billy the same terrain is \u201cdense with motion: the motion of ancestors, spirits, the animals that should be here and the animals that shouldn\u2019t, songs, stories, people, goods. \u2026 When he crosses the plain he both lives inside this density and passes over it.\u201d",
      "Another harsh landscape provides the backdrop for the ruthless exploitation of a group of enslaved women in Tracey Rose Peyton\u2019s powerful first novel, ",
      " Texas in the 1850s is where failed plantation owners like Charles Harlow try to start over. When he and his wife left Georgia, he was advised to \u201cinvest in women.\u201d Not only are they \u201ccheaper than men,\u201d they\u2019re \u201cmore versatile.\u201d And if they can be made to bear children, his work force will be enlarged at little cost.",
      "Much of the action is narrated in the communal voice of the six women enslaved by the couple they\u2019ve renamed the Lucys (short for \u201cspawn of Lucifer\u201d). What little resistance they can muster comes from their solidarity as a group \u2014 meeting in the woods at night to preserve what they can of their own heritage, employing folk remedies to avert pregnancy when Harlow installs a \u201cstockman\u201d in one of the cabins. But as the years pass, their solidarity is threatened by other priorities: One woman yearns to see her children, held in bondage back in Georgia; another is tempted into risky behavior in pursuit of a forbidden romance. And for all, the daily struggle to survive is made even harder by epidemics of yellow fever and plagues of locusts.",
      "In a deft twist, a discovery by Harlow\u2019s wife brings the plantation\u2019s dangerous drama to a climax. At the same time, Texas is being swept by rumors of a \u201cgreat plot with Northern abolitionists who aimed to destroy the state by fire and make way for insurrection.\u201d As white vigilantes go on a rampage, the prospect of safety for runaways lies just across the border in Mexico. The \u201cNegro colony\u201d there has been described by a recent arrival as \u201cthe closest I\u2019ll see in this life\u201d to heaven. But all these women can see is a living hell."

Simon passionately explained the process behind \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water,\u201d one of the most heart-rending songs of the 20th century. Then he started singing. Most of the chords and bridges came into his head immediately; then they didn\u2019t. \u201cWhat makes you stuck?\u201d Cavett asked. \u201cWell,\u201d Simon said, \u201ceverywhere I went led me where I didn\u2019t want to be.\u201d",

There is poverty, there are medical issues, there are challenges that can\u2019t be willed away with a positive attitude. \u201cAnatomy\u201d tackles the internal factors that keep you mired in the mud; for these, Alter has a four-pronged approach.",
      "First, he demystifies the experience of being stuck, explaining how and why this is so common. He examines its emotional consequences \u2014 the pain, anxiety and loneliness of feeling that you\u2019re the only person who can\u2019t lose weight/do your taxes/get a promotion. Then Alter moves on to the strategies and scripts that can help you unblock yourself. Finally, he provides a primer on changing ingrained habits.",

      "The desire for drama, Lyons suggests, comes from both a desperate need for attention and a fear that when we take a step back we\u2019ll discover our own emptiness.

      "We need to face unpleasant and sometimes devastating truths to get on with our lives, and Greer breaks down the elements of denial into digestible components: wishing and hoping, missing the signs, believing what you\u2019re told and turning a little into a lot. It\u2019s extraordinary, really, the way denial can twist you in knots. For example, the new partner who isn\u2019t really available if you\u2019re feeling sick or need help, but constantly asks you to assist him: Instead of seeing that he\u2019s offloading responsibility, you begin to think, ",

      "At their groundbreaking restaurant ",
      ", Junghyun and Jeongeun Park seem to have the keys to a secret room filled with flavors that New York\u2019s older Korean restaurants barely hint at. Nearly every course on the elaborate tasting menus is made up of a dozen or more ingredients. There are stunning imported vinegars derived from mugwort, birch and cherry blossoms. Kimchi, often made on site, does not stop with cabbage and radishes but plunges into a realm of fermented tomatoes, chiles and mustard leaves.",
      "Some interesting items turn up on the plates at ",
      ", too, which the Parks \u2014 he goes by J.P. and she is called Ellia \u2014 have been operating in the Rockefeller Center concourse since October. You can, for instance, eat a sorbet flavored by the fleshy seed stalks of the Japanese raisin tree.",
      "But novelty is not the main point of this younger restaurant. While Atomix tries to expand our notions of what modern Korean cuisine might contain, Naro\u2019s executive chef, Nate Kuester, takes a different tack. His kitchen dives straight into traditional foods, starting with favorites like bibimbap and seafood jeon and reaching back to recipes that predate the 20th century, in ways that make them seem full of unexplored potential.",
      "Naengchae, a chilled salad usually presented with thin strips of vegetables fanned out on a plate, is a mainstay of Korean tables inside and outside the home. At Naro, the naengchae looks like a nest of vermicelli noodles when it shows up. The vermicelli turn out to be threads of kohlrabi, and they sit on top of lumps of king crab, slices of simmered octopus, wheels of watermelon radish and dabs of hot mustard, all meant to be stirred together. There\u2019s something else, too: flaky crystals of radish granita. This is an allusion to mul naengmyeon, cold noodles served in ice-cold, sometimes slushy brine that is used to pickle radishes. It\u2019s a magician\u2019s trick, this salad that turns into noodles that turn back into a salad again.",
      "Another illusion: the one-bite appetizer that looks at first like a piece of kimbap, soft tendrils of bracken fern wrapped in a belt of seaweed. When you eat it, though, you discover that the seaweed has somehow become as puffy and crunchy as a cracker \u2014 a version of gim bugak, the fried seaweed snack.",
      "Sanjeok, normally a straightforward skewer of grilled meats and vegetables, is also reimagined at Naro. Sweet soft bricks of butternut squash alternate with lengths of emulsified chicken sausage. It is surely the best chicken hot dog on a stick ever served in a Korean restaurant.",
      "Simpler dishes hold discoveries at Naro, too, like mixed mushrooms stir-fried with pickled burdock and mounded over a bowl of short-grain rice. The mushrooms are seasoned with sesame oil and seeds, and the rice is merely steamed, but very few things I\u2019ve eaten lately have tasted as rare and luxurious. And this is only a side dish. It showed up, with no warning from the menu, alongside a snowy block of halibut in a golden, aromatic broth made from the rice wine cheongju.",
      "You eat all this and more in a spare, incongruously futuristic dining room separated from the concourse by a curving Art Deco glass wall. Black chairs punctuate an expanse of white and off-white panels and banquettes, making the space look something like a set from \u201c",
      ".\u201d (It may be relevant that Naro-1 was the name of ",
      " to place a satellite in orbit around the earth.)",
      "A darker shade of paint on the ceiling and the sheer curtains that appeared on the glass wall in April have made the space look slightly less sci-fi. It is not the only change at Naro as the Parks try to adapt their vision of formal Korean dining to an underground mall full of office workers, tourists, commuters and skaters. The price of the tasting menus at dinner (one vegetarian and one not, each with about 11 courses) dropped to $165 from $195. Lunch, which had been a five-course, $95 tasting, now comes in a variety of sizes: two courses for $52, two courses and dessert for $68, and an \u00e0 la carte menu that runs from $19 to $46.",
      "The Parks have always been skilled at fitting their hospitality style to their interiors. At their first restaurant, ",
      ", which looks like an after-work canteen that might have been designed by ",
      " the hospitality strikes a gracious, casual tone. The precise but engaging spirit at Atomix sets the standard for tasting-counter service in the city.",
      "Naro aims for a blend of formality and friendliness, and servers are quick with a smile. They\u2019re quick all around, and not always in the right way. Early on, explanations of some dishes were so rushed I am still not quite sure what I ate, and the check was dropped at the same time as dessert; before I\u2019d picked up a spoon, somebody circled back for my credit card.",
      "The pace has slowed, but I still get the sense that Naro, like some of ",
      " in the concourse, is still trying to catch the rhythms of Rockefeller Center, where some people come just to look around and others are on their way to some other place.",
      "None of this seems to afflict Naro\u2019s kitchen, which has always been uncannily assured. The pastry chef, Celia Lee, who was last seen at ",
      ", puts together sweet meditations that could probably stand alone if the Parks decided to turn Naro into a dessert bar. Her sorbet of hallabong tangerines, a prized product of the island of Jeju, paired with fresh tangerine sections and a fluffy gin-scented cloud of Negroni over jellied Champagne, might even work at one of the city\u2019s more forward-thinking cocktail bars."

      "Ms. Kim had wanted to study pastry in France since she was young, taking pastry and baking classes in middle school and participating in grueling pastry competitions in college in South Korea.",

While their paths differ, their work is defining a growing category of pastry art that is confined neither to South Korea nor to France. It is generating long lines, earning Michelin stars and wielding influence across the pastry world.",

Inside, you\u2019ll find that emoji-like corn mousse; the Lys\u00e9e, her signature brown rice mousse cake, which looks like a midcentury Polly Pocket piece; and a fervor for each (the shop sets a limit of one corn mousse per reservation).",

This is in our mind. Naturally this will come into our food. That makes our food and our place very special.\u201d",

After graduating from culinary art programs in Busan, South Korea, where she grew up, and in New York City, Ms. Son purchased about 50 American and French cookbooks on cookies, cakes, bread and professional pastry, and watched famed pastry chefs like C\u00e9dric Grolet and Amaury Guichon at work on YouTube.",

      "In the West, where traditional Korean ingredients, techniques and desserts are not bound by the same cultural expectations, this style of pastry has been well received. But back in South Korea, it can be more of an adjustment for pastry chefs and customers.",
      " in Seoul isn\u2019t just for grab-and-go treats or a convenient meeting spot for friends, as is common in densely populated cities throughout Asia. Jae In Lee, the pastry chef, refuses to sell coffee, and slips Korean ingredients like woodsy burdock and soy sauce into otherwise traditional French goods like mille-feuille and madeleines.",

      "This recipe from Ali Slagle marries sour cream and onion dip with breaded chicken cutlets; it\u2019s as excellent as you might imagine. It\u2019s also less messy than the typical flour-egg-bread crumb dredging process you find in similar recipes.",
      "Could you brown some meat and cover it with jarred tomato sauce and call it meat sauce? You could. Would it be as good as this one-pot, no-chop recipe from Ali Slagle? It would not.

    "name": "10 Boxed Wines That Are Really Good, Seriously",
    "author": "By Eric Asimov",
    "publication_date": "2023-05-04T15:37:52.000Z",
    "body": [
      "For many reasons, boxed wines make an enormous amount of sense. The ",
      " method is a great way to package easygoing wines that are not intended for aging. Still, the category faces stubborn resistance among both consumers and producers.",
      "Why? It\u2019s sort of a chicken-and-the-egg situation: Consumers have equated boxes with bad wine because for so long, with scattered exceptions, only bad wine was sold in boxes in the United States. And producers wouldn\u2019t put better wines in boxes because they are aware of the fierce stigma.",
      "To everybody\u2019s benefit, these entrenched attitudes seem to have softened in the last few years, primarily because of the climate crisis.",
      "Motivated by the ecological advantages of bag-in-box packaging, a growing number of producers and merchants are opting to box good wine intended for immediate consumption rather than use glass bottles.",
      "It\u2019s now widely understood that wine bottles are ",
      ". Their production and transport makes up the biggest proportion of the wine industry\u2019s carbon footprint, and sadly, in the United States, at least, a low percentage of glass is recycled.",
      "The industry has experimented with ",
      ", but consumers did not return them, regardless of the incentives offered. As a result, many environmentally minded producers see bag-in-box packages as a good intermediate step toward a time when consumers will accept the wisdom of reusable bottles.",
      "An open box of wine lasts longer. When you uncork a bottle and pour out a drink, air fills the empty space in the bottle, causing the wine to slowly deteriorate. Depending on the age and quality of the wine, an open bottle may stay good for a day or two, or maybe up to a week.",
      "But when you tap and pour a bag-in-box, the plastic liner shrinks around the remaining wine, keeping air out. Wine can stay fresh for a month or so. In addition, the standard unit for boxed wine is three liters, the equivalent of four bottles, so the amount of waste is proportionately less.",
      "Bag-in-box is not appropriate for all wines. Unlike bottles, which are impervious to air, bag-in-box is permeable, so it\u2019s not good for wines intended for aging more than a year or so. But for those intended for early consumption \u2014 the vast majority of wines produced \u2014 boxes are great.",
      "As with any wine, it\u2019s best to store them in a cool place. Put a box of white wine in the fridge and pour a cool glass anytime. Reds can be kept anywhere that\u2019s convenient.",
      "While the food-grade plastic used inside the box is not recyclable, the benefits of boxes, advocates say, still outweigh the drawbacks.",
      "\u201cIf we are looking at the fact that it\u2019s a larger format, and the fact that it\u2019s one bit of packaging versus four bottles of wine, and it\u2019s 75 percent recycled cardboard, waste is reduced significantly,\u201d said Melissa Monti Saunders, the chief executive of ",
      ", an importer and distributor that now offers four boxed wines in its portfolio.",
      "Ms. Saunders believes that ultimately the world will need to shift to returnable, reusable bottles. But she also believes that consumers are not yet ready to accept them. Communal Brands has been selling boxes since 2016.",
      "\u201cThe carbon footprint is about a tenth of the emissions for the production of four single-use bottles, not even taking into consideration weight and transport,\u201d she said. \u201cNo way around it, boxes are significantly better for the planet, even with a plastic liner.\u201d",
      "Megan Glaab, who owns ",
      " in Sonoma County, Calif., with her husband, Ryan, released a boxed wine in 2020, during the pandemic, almost as a joke. Ryme packaged the wine, a 2019 organic vermentino, as a sort of back-to-school kit for adults who might be daunted by the prospect of remote schooling and working from home.",
      "\u201cWe got the most incredible reaction, with customers writing us and asking us to do it again,\u201d she said. Ryme did, with three more wines in boxes, and they sold out in a matter of weeks.",
      "The key to changing consumer perceptions of boxed wines is to fill them with good wine. Ryme did that, as has ",
      ", a California producer in Paso Robles, and ",
      " in California.",
      "Even charging upward of $70 for a box, more than twice as much as many other boxed wines, did not deter Ms. Glaab\u2019s customers.",
      "For years, the only boxed wines that I\u2019ve felt good about recommending came from two importers: ",
      " From the Tank boxes, and ",
      " Wineberry Boxes. Both offer a series of unpretentious, good wines from various regions in France. Slowly but surely, they are now being joined by a host of other good boxed wines.",
      "I recently shopped for boxed wines in retail stores in the New York area. They weren\u2019t easy to find, though I could have had my fill of ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      ", the sort of mass-produced boxes that have not won the genre friends among quality-minded consumers.",
      "But I did find 10 boxes that I feel confident in recommending. And with good boxes like these, perhaps we will see more in the near future.",
      "\u201cPeople are seeing market interest in boxes, so they want to get in on it,\u201d Ms. Saunders said. \u201cThe more quality boxes on the market, the more it becomes legitimized.\u201d",
      "Here are the 10 boxes. I\u2019ve listed them in order of preference, but they\u2019re all good.",
      "Would you pay $72 for a boxed wine? Perhaps you would if it were as good as this blend. It\u2019s juicy and vivacious, a rare American sangiovese that is not over-the-top fruity or sweet. Eighty-five percent sangiovese and 15 percent friulano, it\u2019s an homage to the days when white grapes (more likely malvasia or trebbiano than friulano) were blended into Chianti to create a fragrant, easygoing wine. This wine is certainly fragrant, but also has enough structure to stand up to grilled beef dishes, ",
      " or red sauce pastas. As for the cost? Three liters at $72 equates to $18 a bottle. Not bad for wine made from organically farmed Mendocino grapes.",
      "This makes no bones about its purpose, or at least, its marketing strategy: \u201cGood Wine to Save the World.\u201d I don\u2019t know if it will, but it sure is good. It\u2019s bright and fresh, full of red fruit flavors but not sweet or cloying, and its lively acidity makes it deliciously refreshing. It\u2019s a blend of tempranillo and monastrell, as mourv\u00e8dre is known in Spain, all organically grown. Chill ever so lightly and you are in for a pleasant treat and a great value. (Sounder Imports, Staten Island, N.Y.)",
      "Ms. Saunders of Communal Brands believes boxes are a good intermediate step before, inevitably, we will turn to reusable wine bottles. Schpl\u00efnk is an excellent example of the sort of unpretentious wines that benefit from this packaging. It\u2019s pure and delightful, with the herbal, grassy qualities that can make gr\u00fcner veltliner so pleasant and refreshing. The grapes come from eastern Austria and are grown organically by Norbert Bauer, a longtime family estate. (Communal Brands, New York)",
      "This light-bodied blend of pinot noir and gamay from the M\u00e2connais region of southern Burgundy, another Communal Brands box, is an ideal thirst-quenching red. It\u2019s fresh, lightly fruity, deliciously refreshing and it goes down easy. You don\u2019t need to ponder its intricacies. It\u2019s just the thing for any gathering of friends, or for when you just want a glass. Give it a light chill and serve with anything. (Communal Brands)",
      "Jenny & Fran\u00e7ois Selections was one of the first American importers of natural wines, and an early proponent of boxes. This ros\u00e9 uses wine from one of the importer\u2019s producers, Domaine de la Patience in southern France. It\u2019s a blend of grenache and cinsault, and is a wonderful choice for parties, barbecues or any sort of outdoor gathering where you want something fresh, lively and resonant. This is an easy-drinking wine, but chances are you\u2019ll pause a moment in the festivities to say, \u201cWow, this is good.\u201d (Jenny & Fran\u00e7ois Selections, New York)",
      "Here is an archetypal boxed wine: juicy, simple and fresh, made for drinking, not thinking. It comes from Italy, from a winery based in Le Marche, though it\u2019s not clear where the grapes were grown. It\u2019s mostly made from sangiovese, with 15 percent trebbiano, a white grape, added to lighten it up. The website says they are grown organically, but the box says merely that the farmers are \u201cearth friendly,\u201d whatever that means. Wine lovers may be frustrated by the lack of transparency. Those who care only about how it tastes will enjoy it. (Sandy Wines/Massanois Imports, New York)",
      "For years, Wineberry America, an importer that specializes in Bordeaux, has offered its wooden Wineberry Boxes, filled with a wide variety of simple but delicious French wines that are generally good values. This one, from the region\u2019s eastern reaches, is old-school Bordeaux, medium-bodied, modestly structured and not overwhelmingly fruity. It\u2019s easy-drinking with charcuterie or burgers. (Wineberry America, Valley Cottage, N.Y.)",
      "Caspri & Co, in Italy, is focused on good values and environmentally sensitive packaging. This boxed Tuscan red qualifies on both counts. It\u2019s a blend of 80 percent sangiovese, 10 percent canaiolo (a traditional grape for blending with sangiovese) and 10 percent merlot, from two different vintages, all grown organically. It\u2019s juicy yet structured and medium-bodied. My only objection is that the bitter chocolate of the merlot feels a bit out of place in the blend. But it\u2019s still very good. (Field Blend Selections, New York)",
      "Cedric, another box from Communal Brands, comes from the Cahors area of southwestern France, where malbec has been the leading red grape for centuries. This wine, made from organically grown grapes, is structured and lightly fruity, yet herbal as well, with light, stony flavors. It\u2019s different from an Argentine malbec, and not as sweet or fruity as many inexpensive Mendoza wines can be, yet it will go equally well with a ",
      ". (Communal Brands)",
      "This crisp, tangy, citrus-scented chardonnay comes primarily from Columbia Valley grapes purchased by Powers, along with a healthy helping of its own estate chardonnay, grown organically. It\u2019s a blend of vintages, not a bad thing, especially in a wine this cheap. Do the math \u2014 four bottles for $21 is roughly $5.25 a bottle. For that price, it\u2019s hard to imagine a better deal."

      "In the United States, ",
      " almost universally entails tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta. However, a recent visit to Italy reminded me that the lasagna family is, in fact, vast and varied. There are hard-boiled egg and meatball-stuffed lasagnas from Naples; chicken liver studded ones from Le Marche; Bolognese and b\u00e9chamel-swathed examples from Emilia-Romagna.",
      "But there was one version that made me run to pull out my lasagna pan as soon as I got home: white lasagna. Made with a b\u00e9chamel sauce and often meatless, white lasagnas are plush, creamy showcases for seasonal vegetables \u2014 artichokes in spring, zucchini in summer, mushrooms in the fall, radicchio in winter \u2014 layered between thin sheets of pasta, then baked until golden.",
      "This version evokes spring with a combination of leeks, asparagus, spinach and peas, all of which are much quicker and easier to deal with than fresh artichokes. And into the bargain, having a mix of different vegetables gives this lasagna an exquisitely complex flavor.",
      "Like most lasagna recipes, it\u2019s a bit of a project. You need to make the b\u00e9chamel, saut\u00e9 the vegetables, then layer everything together with four kinds of cheese (mozzarella, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano and ricotta).",
      "But unlike some lasagna recipes, you don\u2019t have to make the pasta by hand. You don\u2019t even have to search out fresh lasagna noodles from the store. Dried noodles from the box (either no-boil or regular) work exceptionally well here, because the liquid from the b\u00e9chamel and all the vegetables will cook the noodles as the lasagna bakes, saving you what Marcella Hazan describes as the \u201cnecessary nuisance\u201d of cooking, washing, wringing and drying the pasta. One doesn\u2019t deviate from Marcella\u2019s instruction lightly, but that\u2019s a lot of nuisance.",
      "She and I do agree that lasagna suffers no harm from being prepared up to two days ahead. You can assemble it ahead and bake it as your guests arrive, or else assemble and bake it ahead, then reheat just before serving. Both methods make for a great dish, but you\u2019ll end up with a firmer, easier-to-slice lasagna if you bake ahead and reheat. Or you can time things to let the freshly baked lasagna rest for 30 minutes before serving.",
      "Lasagna may have left behind a lot of cousins in Italy when it became American, but there\u2019s still so much to learn from the extended family."

      "Legislation that allows any layperson to perform a marriage on a given day in New York may not seem like a top priority in Albany. And in reality, this assumption appears to be correct: It took 16 years for legislation on a one-day designation ",
      ".",
      "But for many, the new law, which went into effect March 28, was long overdue.",
      "Previously, only ordained members of the clergy and certain government officials had been permitted to solemnize a marriage in New York. In some counties, including the five counties of New York City, people can become ordained ministers online through platforms like Universal Life Church or American Marriage Ministries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be offering a new service,\u201d said Michael McSweeney, the city clerk who oversees the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really enhance the experience for people who want to have that special loved one officiate at their ceremony without having to take the step of becoming an ordained minister of a church.\u201d",
      "Marriages performed by officiants ordained online are not legally recognized in some of the state\u2019s counties, including Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester. The new law helps couples getting married in New York avoid misunderstandings regarding the validity of nontraditional ministers.",
      "While going through a divorce, some couples found out that they had never been legally married all along. ",
      " discovered in a case by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court that their marriage and prenuptial agreement were void because the officiant had been a Universal Life Church minister.",
      "In 2006, Sandra Galef, then a Democratic assemblywoman from Ossining, N.Y., first proposed legislation on a one-day designation for a clear alternative. Such a measure passed last year, and Gov. Kathy Hochul signed it into law on Dec. 28, 2022.",
      "One-day officiants do not have to be New York State residents, but they must be at least 18 years old. ",
      "More than 40 percent of couples in the United States are married by non-clergy, Ms. Galef said in a press announcement. California, Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island all have similar laws that allow an individual to become a marriage officiant for one day.",
      "The one-day designation was an attractive option for Ray Lyn Eddington and Michael Joseph Batal because it is free from religious associations. They are getting married on April 28 on a terrace at the William Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s either city hall, a clergyperson or an ordained minister,\u201d Ms. Eddington, a doula from Brooklyn, said. \u201cBut if there are questions about ordained ministers being legal in some towns, then what do you do? This is a great option.\u201d (Mr. Batal is from Westchester, and they had initially considered getting married there.)",
      "Mr. Batal, who manages money for a private family, found out about the new law while researching ways to get a friend to officiate a wedding. He had previously officiated his brother\u2019s wedding in Massachusetts with a one-day license 20 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt brought back fond memories,\u201d he said.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal wanted Elizabeth Barnes to officiate their wedding because she had set the two up on a blind date in December 2019. They asked her on April 8, which was her 20-year anniversary of being cancer free, if she could perform their marriage.",
      "\u201cI started crying because all the things in life that you fight so hard for,\u201d said Ms. Barnes, a founder of two restaurants in New York, London Lennie\u2019s and Saltaire Oyster Bar. She has been Mr. Batal\u2019s longtime neighbor in Rye, N.Y. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that I could be there and not miss it and do it.\u201d",
      "Briana Myers, a philanthropies manager from Brooklyn, also received a one-day license from the Manhattan Marriage Bureau for Christie Mattson and Oliver Chan\u2019s April 22 wedding at Dumbo Loft in Brooklyn. The couple asked Ms. Myers to officiate because she had done some standup comedy shows. The couple wanted to commemorate the bride\u2019s father, who died and had been known for his dad jokes at family weddings. So, Ms. Myers told a few dad jokes at the ceremony in memory of Ms. Mattson\u2019s father.",
      "Out of excitement, Ms. Myers got ordained by the Universal Life Church immediately after the couple asked her to officiate in February 2022. The next step would have been to register her ordination at the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, but thanks to the new law, she didn\u2019t have to. The one-day license was more \u201cfit for purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to marry a whole bunch of other people or, set up my own place of worship.\u201d",
      "Ms. Myers said the process was much easier. \u201cIt was one form and it took five minutes.\u201d",
      "After a couple obtains a marriage license from their town or city clerk office, the officiant must apply for the one-day license at the same office and pay a $25 fee. They do not need to apply in person and can mail in the completed documents.",
      "In New York City, officiants must apply to the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, regardless of the borough in which the couple received their marriage license. They can either download the ",
      ", fill it out and sign it in front of a notary public, and mail it to the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Or, they could ",
      ", bring identification and fill out the paperwork in the office and receive the license on the spot. Each county may have a different setup, so the best first step is to visit the appropriate town or city clerk\u2019s website for guidelines.",
      "Within five days after the ceremony, the officiant must mail back the one-day license attached to the marriage license.",
      "The clerk at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau provides licensees with a script to read during the ceremony. Ms. Myers said she used \u201cthe legal sounding parts of the script\u201d during Ms. Mattson and Mr. Chan\u2019s wedding because of her \u201clack of qualifications\u201d in solemnizing a marriage.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal appreciated the personal touch that their officiant brought to their nuptials.",
      "\u201cSo much better having such a special ceremony conducted by a dear friend who didn\u2019t need to be ordained, instead of a stranger,\u201d Mr. Batal said."

      "Soon they were texting each other every day. At the time, Ms. Bonnick, a Broadway stage manager, lived in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, and had no work since all the theaters had shut down. She has asthma, so she was nervous about catching Covid-19. \u201cI was in my apartment with my roommate and her cats, just hanging out for a long time,\u201d she said. Mr. McDonnell was working remotely for New York Theater Workshop as a special projects associate, and living with his parents in Carle Place, N.Y., where he grew up.",
      "In search of a novel virtual activity for them to try, Mr. McDonnell came across the \u201c",

      "Over the course of three consecutive Saturdays, they went through the entire list. Each conversation lasted around three hours.",
      "\u201cIt works,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. \u201cWe fell in love.\u201d",
      "Mr. McDonnell said he appreciated that Ms. Bonnick \u201cwas willing to answer everything with a lot of vulnerability and thoughtfulness.\u201d",
      "Recently, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell looked through the text messages they sent each other during those early months. \u201cWe were there for each other through the really weird parts of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      "They found ways to connect outside of the digital world, too. At one point, Ms. Bonnick, who rarely cooked or baked, mailed Mr. McDonnell a tin of homemade snickerdoodle cookies with a handwritten note. \u201cShe baked the cookies, she went to the post office in the middle of the pandemic, went to the trouble to overnight ship them,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cThat was the first time I thought, Is this what being in love is like?\u201d",
      "The note Ms. Bonnick sent with the cookies began a tradition that they still keep up with. Every month, on the anniversary of their first date, on March 19, Ms. Bonnick leaves a Post-it note for Mr. McDonnell to find. And Mr. McDonnell writes her notes during the run of each show she works on. (For their wedding, Ms. Bonnick made Mr. McDonnell a box full of notes and photos, and he wrote her a letter and made a digital album of 36 photos, one from every month they had been dating.)",
      "After more than three months of dating from afar, they finally met in person on Memorial Day, at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. \u201cWe talked for a long time,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. When they were saying goodbye, both were wearing masks and didn\u2019t know how to end the meeting physically. \u201cIn normal times, it would be a \u2018Do we kiss now?\u2019\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Instead, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a weird pause, and Patrick goes, \u2018Is it OK if we hug?\u2019\u201d Disappointed, Ms. Bonnick went home and told her roommate, \u201cWell, that was nice while it lasted.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick was convinced that the hug signified coldness, but she was misreading the signs. Soon after, Mr. McDonnell texted her as usual, and their romance continued. They began seeing each other regularly in person.",
      "That summer delivered a series of painful challenges that solidified their commitment to each other.",
      "Since receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater arts from State University of New York at New Paltz in 2014, Ms. Bonnick, 30, has worked in theater. In 2016, she had her big break as the production assistant for \u201cHadestown\u201d at the show\u2019s Off Broadway debut at New York Theater Workshop. She went on to work on shows like \u201cThe Cherry Orchard,\u201d \u201cCaroline, or Change\u201d and, more recently, \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d But several months into the pandemic, she was wondering if her career in theater was over. All she could think, she said, was \u201cI\u2019ve spent five years investing in something that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d",
      "She was facing challenges on a personal level as well. In late spring 2020, Ms. Bonnick\u2019s maternal grandfather, Joseph Johnson, died, and in August, her paternal grandfather, Keith Bonnick, also died. The Black Lives Matter protests that began in late May raised difficult emotions for Ms. Bonnick. And she and her roommate found out on short notice that they had to move out of their apartment.",
      "Mr. McDonnell, 28, who received a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater from Brooklyn College in 2017, had held on to his job for the New York Theater Workshop when the pandemic began. He is currently working full time as a security guard at Madison Square Garden.",
      "That summer, he faced a major health scare. \u201cI had a massive tumor growing along the side of my jaw,\u201d he said. \u201cIt started the size of a pea and by summer it was the size of a golf ball. I started going for tests. In mid-August, I had surgery to remove it.\u201d When he went in for a follow-up, the doctors told him that the lump had been an extremely rare form of cancer called secretory carcinoma. \u201cLuckily it was a clean removal,\u201d he said.",
      "Also that summer, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s grandfather on his father\u2019s side, James McDonnell, died, an event that deeply affected his family.",
      "Throughout it all, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell leaned on each other. He came to Manhattan regularly to join the Black Lives Matter protests or to help out at New York Theater Workshop, which, along with other theaters, decided to open its lobby to give protesters a place to drink water, use the bathrooms or just rest. In the evenings, he would head to Ms. Bonnick\u2019s apartment and stay overnight.",
      "That summer \u201cwas one of the ways I knew and felt very confident that the relationship was built to last,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cWe spent time together either navigating these things directly or hanging out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we wanted an escape, we could have an escape. If we wanted to plan, we could plan. If we just wanted to be safe, we could comfort each other. There wasn\u2019t any tension between us.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick said that all of the challenges they faced that summer, along with having started a relationship talking on the phone or texting and having done the 36 questions early on, built a foundation of constant communication. Check-ins became a norm. \u201cWe don\u2019t really fight now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t disagree. If we disagree, we\u2019re just having a different kind of conversation.\u201d",
      "Last summer, they started floating the idea of marriage. For Mr. McDonnell, the month of July carries particular significance. On July 2, 2008, when he was 13, Mr. McDonnell almost drowned at Jones Beach. The situation was dire enough that a helicopter evacuated him to a nearby hospital and he was kept there overnight. \u201cAround that time every year I think about what it means to be alive and to have been so close to death,\u201d he said. \u201cLast July, I knew I wanted to be married to her and I didn\u2019t want to wait much longer.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick agreed. So that August, Mr. McDonnell arranged an outing in Port Washington, N.Y., with Ms. Bonnick\u2019s parents, Karen and Hugh Bonnick; her brother Jalel Bonnick; his parents, Laura and Peter McDonnell; his aunt and uncle, Linda and Greg Pietrzak; and his cousin Jeffrey Pietrzak. His plan to propose on the dock as the sun set was almost thwarted when the arrival of Ms. Bonnick\u2019s family from Staatsburg, N.Y., where her parents live, was delayed. Luckily, they made it, with 20 minutes to spare before nightfall.",
      "\u201cHe got down on one knee at the waterfront during sunset and asked me to marry him,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Afterward, the two families, who were meeting for the first time, went for dinner nearby at Finn MacCool\u2019s.",
      "Choosing New York Theater Workshop as the venue for the wedding was easy. Mr. McDonnell worked at the theater for four years, and Ms. Bonnick worked on four shows there, including \u201cHadestown\u201d and \u201cSlave Play.\u201d \u201cThat was where we launched our careers and met many of our friends,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. (They never met through work, though Mr. McDonnell knew of Ms. Bonnick.)",
      "On March 19, 2023, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell were wed in the theater\u2019s rehearsal room in front of 44 guests. Their friend, Yang-Yang Chen, who was ordained by Open Ministry, officiated. They asked guests to test for Covid-19 if they felt unwell.",
      "When choosing the date for the wedding, Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick quickly settled on March 19, their anniversary and a Sunday this year. But what they didn\u2019t count on was Ms. Bonnick\u2019s work schedule.",
      "After the 10:30 a.m. ceremony and a brunch featuring mimosas, crepe cakes from Lady M Cake Boutique, and a coffee truck, Ms. Bonnick rushed across Manhattan, from Fourth Street to the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on West 46th Street, for a 3 p.m. preview performance of \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d Ms. Bonnick, the show\u2019s assistant stage manager, walked in wearing a white, ankle-length JessaKae dress with puff sleeves. \u201cAll of my friends, the whole stage management team, were screaming,\u201d she said. Afterward, she said, \u201cI checked the props in my wedding dress.\u201d",
      "After the show, she met Mr. McDonnell and a small group of friends and family for dinner at Dim Sum Palace on Second Avenue. At some point, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell realized that besides being their anniversary, March 19 was also the last day of winter this year. \u201cIt was the perfect time for a new beginning,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      " March 19, 2023",

      "Luis Alberto Correa and Ronald David Corning met on Nov. 25, 2017, at a holiday party that neither was attending. The party was in the lobby of the Arpeggio Apartments building in Dallas. Mr. Correa, who lived in the building, was simply returning after walking his cocker spaniel, Chloe, and in no way dressed for a soiree.",
      "Mr. Corning, on the other hand, was there to pick up his friend. \u201cAnd my friend said, \u2018Come in here. There are cute guys,\u2019\u201d he said. Mr. Corning and Mr. Correa met and chatted briefly.",
      "The following week, the same friend texted Mr. Corning: \u201cDo you remember that guy you met in the lobby? He asked about you.\u201d Mr. Corning told his friend to share his number with Mr. Correa.",
      "\u201cWe texted a bit and decided to go together to Oak Lawn\u201d \u2014 a neighborhood in Dallas popular with L.G.B.T.Q. people \u2014 \u201cto meet a group of my friends for Sunday Funday and dinner,\u201d Mr. Corning said.",
      "He then left for two weeks, traveling on a pre-Christmas vacation, but they continued to text regularly. Upon Mr. Corning\u2019s return, they met on Dec. 28 for their official first date at V-Eats, a vegan restaurant that has since closed.",
      "\u201cWe spent a lot of time together in January having conversations about the age difference and our worlds,\u201d Mr. Corning, 51, said. \u201cI was pretty rigid about dating someone closer to my age. I reluctantly went forward with meeting him, and probably did it in a more casual setting among friends.\u201d He did not want to jump in headfirst.",
      "But after they spent more time together, Mr. Corning felt like he could express his reservations to Mr. Correa. He wasn\u2019t worried that they wouldn\u2019t have common interests, but that Mr. Correa wouldn\u2019t be \u201ccomfortable with somebody older.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Correa, 31, has always thought of age as a number, he said, and sees \u201cpeople for who they are.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomeone older doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are any wiser than me,\u201d he said. \u201cI made sure to show with my actions that I wanted to be in a serious and committed relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believed him,\u201d Mr. Corning said.",
      "By the end of January 2018, the two admitted to themselves and one another that they were inseparable. In April 2018, Mr. Correa moved into Mr. Corning\u2019s apartment. They bought a home together, where they still live today, in the Dallas neighborhood of Oak Cliff in 2020.",
      "Mr. Corning is the managing partner of creative and talent for OAM, a creative video agency formerly known as On-Air Media. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in history and religion from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass. He moved to Dallas in 2011 from New York City to work as a morning anchor for WFAA, an ABC affiliate.",
      "Mr. Correa is a private client insurance advisor for IMA Financial Group, a wealth management and insurance company based in Denver, with offices in Dallas. He graduated from Irving High School outside of Dallas.",
      "On July 4, 2021, during a trip to Arvada, Colo., Mr. Corning proposed to Mr. Correa as they celebrated Mr. Correa\u2019s 30th birthday with friends. The back of Mr. Correa\u2019s birthday cake revealed a special message: \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d",
      "Mr. Correa was born on the Fourth of July in Campeche, Mexico, and came to the United States on his 13th birthday in 2004. \u201cWhen I first met Ron, I was worried that telling him about my immigration story would make him reconsider our relationship,\u201d Mr. Correa said of his DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) journey. \u201cI know not everyone understands the challenges that immigrants face, and I didn\u2019t want to scare him off.\u201d",
      "Instead, Mr. Corning, who grew up in Calais, Maine, said that it inspired him \u201cto become an advocate for immigrant rights.\u201d He uses his research skills to support Mr. Correa, who also works with nonprofit organizations like Dreamers2gether and United We Dream.",
      "Mr. Corning and Mr. Correa had a tough time deciding on wedding plans. \u201cWe found ourselves with \u2018paralysis by analysis,\u2019\u201d Mr. Corning said. So, on April 14, with the help of their friends Tara and Fritz Rahr, Mr. Corning said, \u201cWe looked at each other and said, \u2018Let\u2019s just do it now!\u2019\u201d",
      "A week later, the two were wed on April 21 in Fort Worth at the Rahrs\u2019 home. \u201cI joked in my vows that I was so excited for his success in part because maybe I can retire and be a social planner and house manager,\u201d Mr. Corning said.",

      "Taylor Dafoe and Alex Schulte\u2019s relationship has always included film photography. It was the catalyst for their relationship: after leaving his rangefinder film camera at Ms. Schulte\u2019s house during a party in 2015, Mr. Dafoe went back a few days later to pick it up. They ended up going on a first date that weekend.",
      "It was also part of how they got engaged. In June 2022, Mr. Dafoe, now 32, who works as a news and features writer at the art marketing website Artnet, decorated the back yard of their home outside Troy, N.Y., with film photos he had taken during their relationship. He proposed by handing Ms. Schulte, now 32, who works in marketing at Donut, a workplace software company, the same film camera he had left at her house when they first met. The engagement ring came months later.",
      "So when it came time for them to choose a photographer for their September 2023 wedding at June Farms in West Sand Lake, N.Y., it was no surprise that they opted for Autumn Jordan, who is based in Athens, N.Y., and often shoots weddings on film. \u201cThat was part of the appeal, for sure,\u201d Mr. Dafoe said.",
      "In recent years, more and more couples are seeking out photographers who can shoot film photos for their weddings. The look of the photos, often a bit softer and grainier than digital ones, and the slower, more analog process are appealing to many couples who are craving a nostalgic medium. This means that photographers and couples can\u2019t look at the photos until they\u2019ve been developed days or weeks after the wedding.",
      "Ms. Schulte and Mr. Dafoe welcome the limitations of shooting a wedding on film. They shared that the process has even begun to influence how they think about their wedding day in general.",
      "\u201cWe were thinking about trying to do away with some of the preciousness that comes with weddings,\u201d Mr. Dafoe said. Because of the restrictions of film, they would get fewer photographs in the end and have fewer opportunities to reshoot moments. \u201cWe want the event to kind of revel in its own ephemerality,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd choosing to shoot on film, that\u2019s like a big part of that thinking \u2014 because of the material and financial limitations of film.\u201d",
      "Anna Urban, a wedding photographer based in Edinburgh, Scotland, has noticed an increase in couples seeking out film photographers over the past year. Though she still primarily uses digital cameras, in September 2022 she started offering film photography to her clients because of the rise in demand. She charges about 100 pounds per film roll, or around $125. About 5 percent of her wedding clients are choosing to add film to their wedding packages, she said.",
      "\u201cPeople are looking for something different,\u201d Ms. Urban said.\u201cThe whole process is different. You don\u2019t see the effect until you have them scanned, developed. It\u2019s like part of the magic, waiting for the photos.\u201d",
      "Kate Hampson, a photographer based in London, began shooting entire weddings on film in May 2022 because it aligned more closely with her personal interests. Although she would typically bring her film camera to weddings, she spent the first few years of her wedding photography career shooting primarily in digital.",
      "However, she was never completely happy with the results.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t getting inspired by digital,\u201d Ms. Hampson said. \u201cSo eventually I started saying, Would you mind if I shoot maybe half film, half digital?\u201d Before long, she made the jump to shooting exclusively with film. She typically brings a digital camera to weddings as a backup, but rarely uses it. One of the last times she shot a wedding with a digital camera, in June 2022, it happened to be 118 degrees outside and the camera shut off because of the heat, she said.",
      "\u201cThank God for film,\u201d Ms. Hampson said with a laugh.",
      "Jen Huang Bogan, a wedding photographer in Montecito, Calif., said that the more weddings she shot, the more she began to realize that film was the medium she wanted to work in.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until shooting weddings where I was like, OK, there\u2019s a striking difference between digital and film,\u201d Ms. Bogan said.\u201cThe look of film just vastly outperformed digital.\u201d",
      "Couples are typically drawn to her work, Ms. Bogan said, because they are looking for classic, timeless photos, which she feels film is best suited for because it tends to not look tied to a specific time period. She compares shooting in film to painting with oil: It\u2019s the medium that she believes produces the best artistic photographs and gives couples the opportunity to slow down.",
      "\u201cIt really works for weddings and portraiture because it is so natural and also so flattering,\u201d she said.",
      "Jillian Mitchell, a wedding photographer in San Francisco, Mexico, who works mainly in New York and Los Angeles, shoots a majority of her weddings on film. She started working as a wedding photographer in 2009, shooting entirely on digital cameras. She had used film in her personal work, though, and quickly found herself gravitating back toward the medium as she became more involved in wedding photography.",
      "Although she now shoots primarily film photos, she doesn\u2019t restrict herself. \u201cI do think that digital has a place,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. She tends to pull out her digital camera when shooting in low-lit areas, like when she\u2019s capturing candid moments on the dance floor. Even so, she said, \u201cit\u2019s very rare for me to see a digital image that moves me in the way that film does.\u201d",
      "There are some photographers who want to recreate the look of film photos in a digital format. One of them is Jose Villa, a wedding photographer in Solvang, Calif., who has shot exclusively on film for most of his 20-year career.",
      "\u201cWeddings are a living, breathing thing,\u201d he said. He aims to capture photographs without interrupting the cadence of a wedding, which often means that he is photographing moments where he has less control than if he were photographing in a studio.",
      "\u201cWe adjust to those situations, and also still keep our cool, and use the equipment that makes it so that we can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cFilm can be a lot more forgiving.\u201d",
      "Although he still loves shooting in film, over the past few years Mr. Villa has begun taking photos with digital cameras, especially as he works with celebrity clients who post pictures on social media just hours after a wedding.",
      "\u201cFilm was really popular, you know, 20 years ago, and then it went away,\u201d Mr. Villa said. \u201cPeople were talking about it less when digital started becoming better.\u201d Although he believes that some digital photos can be edited to recreate the look of film photos, he also welcomes the resurgence of film photography at weddings.",
      "\u201cI think that it is amazing for these photographers to continue to shoot with film,\u201d he said, \u201cand continue to keep it alive.\u201d"

      "The Beghairati project was born in the wake of criticism Ms. Japanwala, 27, received for her thesis collection at Parsons in 2018: a series of pieces cast from her own body reflecting on and exploring her personal relationship to shame, the one she inherited in Pakistan. \u201cMy thesis was the first time I was actually able to reflect on my identity and understand what a gift my body and my agency was,\u201d she said.",

      " were littered with strangers calling her shameless, sick and obscene, in both English and Urdu.",
      "As a result, Ms. Japanwala developed an obsession with the concept of shame, transforming shamelessness into an area of study. Working on this project gave her \u201cthe understanding that shame and modesty are two entirely different categories that have nothing to do with one another,\u201d and that shame is a pillar of patriarchy and a tool for control, she said.",
      "Around the time the idea for this project began to seed, her grandmother died. Ms. Japanwala would walk by marble shops outside the cemetery and watch the workers carve marble figurines and inscriptions into grave stones. She had also long been watching her city ",

      "There are three parts to the collection: the core, a series of body castings of Pakistani artists and painters who embrace shamelessness in the images they create; a collage of hand sculptures of artists, filmmakers, writers and educators who are forging paths to a more gender-liberated society titled \u201cHands of a Revolution\u201d; and an anonymous project where nipples serve as unique fingerprints of the subjects, some of whom are recently divorced, transitioning or survivors of breast cancer.",

      "Since I first watched the movie \u201cClueless,\u201d I\u2019ve dreamed about the closet of the main character, Cher Horowitz: specifically, the ",
      ".",
      "This sort of ease in getting dressed, where outfits are dictated by an algorithm, can be enticing. Dress codes shift regularly \u2014 the pandemic brought",
      "major changes \u2014 and people often fret over what to wear.",
      "The \u201cClueless\u201d closet was purely fictional back when the movie was released in 1995. Now, though, artificial intelligence has become not only capable but also increasingly commonplace. Could ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, help out?",
      "As my colleagues at The New York Times ",
      ", the type of artificial intelligence that powers ChatGPT is called a large language model, or L.L.M. ",
      ", but essentially, ChatGPT has been trained to respond conversationally to users by being fed huge amounts of text data, including books, articles and conversations. ",
      "I decided to see if I could use ChatGPT-3.5, the publicly available version of the chatbot, as my own \u201cClueless\u201d-style closet computer. The bot can only understand and respond to text, meaning I could ask it specific questions about what I should wear in different situations.",
      "To start, I asked: What should I wear to my office job? The answers, at first, were vague. For an office job, women should wear \u201ca dress, a blouse with dress pants or a skirt\u201d and \u201cmodest and comfortable shoes,\u201d and men should wear \u201ca suit and tie or dress pants and a dress shirt with a jacket.\u201d ",
      "The more specific my questions were, the more specific the chatbot\u2019s answers were. I asked it to plan an outfit for me, a 28-year-old woman who works at a news organization, to wear to the office. ",
      "The chatbot came up with tailored black dress pants, a white button-up blouse, a black blazer and a pair of black closed-toe pumps. That same day, I was sitting in my office wearing a band T-shirt, a long silk skirt and leather clogs. ",
      "When I asked about the outfit I actually wore to work, ChatGPT pushed back. A band T-shirt, it informed me, was not appropriate to wear to work because it \u201cmay send the wrong message about your professionalism.\u201d Noted.",
      "(In fairness to the bot, it also said several times that work dress codes can vary, and that if I was unsure about mine, I should check with a supervisor or H.R. department.)",
      "I started asking about other types of clothing that I\u2019ve worn in the workplace. When I described the midthigh-length dress I wore a few years ago for my job interview at The Times, the chatbot was not impressed. \u201cA midthigh dress may distract the interviewer\u2019s attention and draw focus away from your skills and qualifications as a candidate,\u201d the chatbot warned me. I guess I won\u2019t be hired at its company anytime soon?",
      "When I changed my age, the chatbot suggested different types of outfits. A 21-year-old woman should wear a statement dress, like a sequined mini, to her birthday party, it said. A 29-year-old woman celebrating her birthday, however, should try a \u201cchic jumpsuit,\u201d and a 58-year-old woman should wear a \u201cknee-length shift dress in a classic print, like polka dots or stripes.\u201d ",
      "The outfit for the 21-year-old, according to the chatbot, would let the wearer \u201cbe the center of attention on your special day,\u201d while the older ages elicited outfits that would \u201chelp you feel confident and stylish on your special day.\u201d (At least it was still a \u201cspecial\u201d day no matter how old you are turning \u2014 just not sequin-level special.)",
      "I started asking questions about situations I\u2019d been in where I wore something that went against the norm. Was it appropriate to wear a white dress to a wedding as part of the wedding party, something I did a few months ago? ",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s best to avoid wearing white to a wedding as a guest or as part of the wedding party, as this color is traditionally reserved for the bride,\u201d the chatbot said. It suggested that if I really wanted to wear white, I should check with the bride to see if it would be OK. Which, had I asked this question before the wedding, would have been tricky \u2014 there were no brides at this particular wedding, just grooms.",
      "The chatbot was often diplomatic in its nonanswers. When I asked what to wear to be the most effective boss, the chatbot told me that it \u201ccannot give a definite answer because the \u2018most effective\u2019 clothing style for a boss varies depending on various factors.\u201d ",
      "Similarly, when I asked what the best brand to wear is, the chatbot responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have personal preferences or biases toward any particular brand.\u201d Maybe because the chatbot never actually gets dressed.",
      "And when I asked if it could plan an outfit for me to wear every day \u2014 say, in the style of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos who was ",
      " \u2014 the chatbot said: \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s personal and professional conduct is not something to be emulated, and it is important to focus on ethical business practices and personal integrity rather than just on appearance.\u201d ",
      "Still, it gave me suggestions for what to wear: a black turtleneck, black dress pants, black ankle boots and straight hair with a center part."

      "The 30-minute facials Rachel An Liverman is known for don\u2019t deserve all the credit for the glow she wore on her March 18 wedding to Jeremy William Crane. Love, the time-honored radiance elixir, also played a role. She just wishes it had taken a few shortcuts to find her.",
      "Ms. Liverman, 37, is the founder and chief executive of Glowbar, a chain of facial studios. When she met Mr. Crane, 35, in January 2022 on the dating app Bumble, she had been an on-and-off presence on dating apps since 2011, the year she moved to Manhattan from her hometown of Newton, Mass.",
      "Assurances from friends that she was a catch were no longer chasing away depressing thoughts of a future without a life partner. \u201cAll my friends were married and I was at \u2014 and in \u2014 everyone else\u2019s wedding,\u201d she said.",
      "Mr. Crane relieved her of those thoughts within days of their first meeting, on Jan. 10, 2022, at Barrow\u2019s Pub in Manhattan\u2019s West Village.",
      "Mr. Crane, 35, is the founder of Retrievables, a technology business that connects companies dealing with delinquent accounts to collection firms. When he and Ms. Liverman matched, he was living in Long Island City, where he had moved with a girlfriend in 2019 from his hometown Rochester, N.Y. After their 2021 breakup, he too joined a bevy of dating apps.",
      "His experience, however, was quite different from Ms. Liverman\u2019s. He liked most of the women he met online. \u201cI dated a lot and absolutely loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoyed going out and meeting people and getting to know different establishments around the city.\u201d",
      "Ms. Liverman had experienced more than a few bad dates, including one in which a kind waitress at Morton\u2019s steakhouse in Union Square helped her flee through the back door. Ms. Liverman said she \u201cwas the stereotypical single girl in New York City, crying in the fetal position at night.\u201d",
      "By the time the two met at Barrow\u2019s, after five days of messaging, Mr. Crane was hooked on the repartee he and Ms. Liverman had established. \u201cWe\u2019re both really good at banter,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Rachel, after five minutes, the messages just didn\u2019t stop. We were talking a lot, lot, lot \u2014 to the point where I was entirely distracted, and the only thing I could think about was the next message.\u201d",
      "The back-and-forth on Bumble left Ms. Liverman comfortable enough to make a bold entrance at Barrow\u2019s. When Mr. Crane approached with a great-to-meet-you hug and kiss, she playfully swatted him away and sat down to re-affix a fake nail that had fallen off. This didn\u2019t dim his optimism even a little about the woman who had invited him for a beer at what she called her favorite dive bar.",
      "They spent the next three nights getting to know each other on back-to-back dates. By the end of the week, they were a couple in love. Mr. Crane fell right away; Ms. Liverman needed a few days longer to be sure love had finally come for her.",
      "Mr. Crane grew up the middle son in a family of three tight-knit brothers and their parents, Howard and Leslie Crane. Before he formed Retrievables in 2021, Mr. Crane founded StadiumPark, an app that helped users navigate stadium and arena parking. The app, which he closed when he moved to New York, was up and running in 2013, three years after he graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a bachelor\u2019s degree in consumer science.",
      "Ms. Liverman started carving her entrepreneurial path when she was 10, with a leg-waxing business at her home. A calling to improve the complexions of the masses may have been in her DNA. In her 1988 birth announcement, the Boston Globe hinted as much. \u201cIt said, the granddaughter of the famed Catherine Hinds was born without a wrinkle,\u201d Ms. Liverman said.",
      "Ms. Hinds, her maternal grandmother, who died last year, founded one of the country\u2019s first accredited schools of aesthetics, the Catherine Hinds Institute, in 1979 in Medford, Mass. Ms. Liverman\u2019s mother, An Hinds, who lives in Newton, is the president and chief executive of the institute. Her parents divorced when she was a toddler but remained good friends, she said. Erwin Liverman and Ms. Liverman\u2019s stepmother, Nancy Liverman, who is like a second mother, also live in Newton. Her younger brother and sister live nearby.",
      "The family supported Ms. Liverman\u2019s first business, Rachel\u2019s Waxing Salon, when she was a fifth-grader by supplying her first business cards. \u201cI handed them out to people and told them they could come get their legs waxed at my house,\u201d she said. Two years earlier, her mother had given her a first facial in the family living room. \u201cI always say I was so lucky to grow up in an industry that wasn\u2019t selling tires or something,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a little girl, it was amazing to watch these women. My grandmother was a pioneer.\u201d",
      "After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration from Tulane University in 2007, Ms. Liverman worked briefly as a buyer for T.J. Maxx, then switched to beauty. Her first job in New York was at Birchbox, a subscription product samples company. When she started raising funds for Glowbar in 2017, she was head of visual merchandising and business development at Beautyblender, a purveyor of pink makeup sponges. The 30-minute-facial concept she developed for Glowbar was a way of addressing a problem staring back at her from the mirror in her West Village apartment.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t getting facials in New York because I didn\u2019t have time and I didn\u2019t know who to trust,\u201d she said. \u201cNail salons and celebrity spas and everything in between were doing facials.\u201d Glowbar, which opened in 2019 and now has six locations in New York and Connecticut, offers them exclusively.",
      "For other couples, a shared entrepreneurial instinct might have been enough for sparks to fly. For Mr. Crane, that was ancillary. It was Ms. Liverman\u2019s spirit he fell in love with before he walked her home on their first date. \u201cRachel is easy to love,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s engaging and authentic and just comes off like she never met a stranger.\u201d",
      "Ms. Liverman felt a hard-won sense of ease with Mr. Crane. \u201cI\u2019m a tall person and I capture people\u2019s attention, and I had walked into the bar with all this swagger,\u201d said Ms. Liverman, who stands 5 foot 10. (Mr. Crane is 6 feet tall.) The squad of friends who regularly came to her rescue after disastrous dates in the past, including her neighbor Erica Thomas, had pointed out that men may find her intimidating.",
      "\u201cBut Jeremy was different,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cHer confidence didn\u2019t shake him at all. She could be herself around him. He saw the light in her right away.\u201d",
      "On Jan. 11, the day after their Barrow\u2019s date, Mr. Crane made her a branzino dinner at his place in Long Island City. On Jan. 12, she matched him with a skillet chicken dish in the West Village. Two months later, when his lease was up, he moved into her place, where they still live. \u201cI felt good about it,\u201d Mr. Crane said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like a risk.\u201d",
      "His proposal didn\u2019t feel risky either, because Ms. Liverman had told him how she wanted it to happen. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my friends popping out of bushes in a park,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want any forced attention. I just wanted to get engaged in bed, over my first cup of coffee.\u201d",
      "Mr. Crane did not deviate from that vision. At 7 a.m. on June 4, 2022, he gave her an emerald solitaire ring and a love letter. In the letter, he said, \u201cI told her I knew right away I wanted to be with her forever. I told her she makes me feel content and appreciated and challenged.\u201d",
      "Ms. Liverman and Mr. Crane were married on March 18 in Manhattan at the Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts. Rabbi David Gelfand, from the Temple of Israel of the City of New York, officiated a traditional Jewish ceremony for 225 guests.",
      "Ms. Liverman, in a floor-length, off-the-shoulder Vera Wang wedding gown, was escorted down the aisle by her parents to a huppah garlanded with white blooms. Mr. Crane, in a Corneliani tuxedo, was surrounded there by a group of their closest family members. To mark the start of their life as a married couple, the rabbi wrapped them in a tallit, or wedding shawl, that had passed through generations of Ms. Liverman\u2019s family; later they sipped wine from a cup that belonged to Mr. Crane\u2019s great-grandfather.",
      "The moment Rabbi Gelfand pronounced them married was \u201cmagical,\u201d Ms. Liverman said. \u201cSeeing all our loved ones there for us both, I was overwhelmed with gratitude,\u201d she said.",
      "At a reception also at the foundation, the spirit of gratitude was still with her. Addressing her guests, Ms. Liverman said, \u201cI basically looked at Jeremy and said, \u2018You were so worth the wait.\u2019\u201d",
      " March 18, 2023",
      " The Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, New York",
      " Ms. Liverman\u2019s wedding day skin care routine was simple: She gulped water. \u201cI drank as much as I could to stay hydrated,\u201d she said. \u201cI let my makeup artist do the rest.\u201d Five days earlier, she had gotten a Glowbar facial and dermaplaning skin procedure.",
      " Ms. Thomas called the wedding \u201cepic\u201d and got a workout dancing during the reception, which featured the band Milan 77. \u201cThe dance floor was full at all times,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never stopped dancing.\u201d Betty the Caterer supplied small bites.",
      " The couple\u2019s weekend-long celebration included a rehearsal dinner at the Manhattan pastrami and pickles institution Katz\u2019s Delicatessen, meant to celebrate the city that brought them together. For Ms. Liverman, it was also a chance to bid an energetic good riddance to New York\u2019s dating scene. \u201cWe partied our faces off,\u201d she said."

      "Peter Derek Walters never thought a swarm of bees would get in the way of his proposal to Ray Aaron Quintero on Fire Island in New York.",
      "\u201cI hid two Cartier rings under leaves and branches,\u201d said Mr. Walters, 48, who had secretly and painstakingly set up a picnic overlooking the Great South Bay for the special moment in June 2020. He had also dropped off Champagne and wrote \u201cMarry Me\u201d in the sand.",
      "But, a few hours later while en route with Mr. Quintero, 43, who has been deathly afraid of bees since he was a child, it was all ruined. As soon as Mr. Quintero spotted the swarm he bolted.",
      "Mr. Walters, not a happy camper, walked another 30 minutes by himself to gather everything up, and later resorted to Plan B.",
      "The two met one Sunday afternoon in September 2018 when friends gathered at Boxers, a gay bar in Manhattan\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Their connection was a mutual friend, whom, coincidentally, each casually dated.",
      "\u201cHey, g\u2019day, I\u2019m Peter, you must be Ray,\u201d said Mr. Walters, who recognized him from a Facebook photo taken with that friend in Mykonos, Greece.",
      "Mr. Walters, an identical twin, from Elong Elong, a small village in New South Wales, Australia, grew up in a house abutting his family\u2019s cattle and grain ranch where feral pigs, emus, kangaroos and goannas wandered in from the bush. (He considered bees the most important insect in the ecosystem.) His family also ran a ranch supplies business in the village.",
      "Mr. Walters, the chief executive of the Americas at Inquisitive, an Australian-based education publishing company, graduated from the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, from which he received an M.B.A.",
      "\u201cIs that tall strapping Australian talking to me?,\u201d Mr. Quintero, originally from Tucson, Ariz., recalled thinking. He graduated from the University of Arizona, and is now a managing partner of Healthsperien, a Washington-based health care policy and business strategy consultancy.",
      "Later on, during their first meeting, the group barhopped to Rise Bar nearby. The two chatted on the sidelines and swapped phone numbers.",
      "\u201cIt was the spark of a friendship,\u201d Mr. Walters said, and soon they began hanging out two or three days a week, and even more as the Christmas season revved up.",
      "When Mr. Quintero, who had been working remotely from New York for a year, moved back to Washington over the holidays, their friendship continued.",
      "Like a good friend, three weeks later, Mr. Quintero showed up for Mr. Walters at his birthday/Australia Day open house in January where about 80 guests snacked on Vegemite, Tim Tams and assorted Aussie lollies at Mr. Walter\u2019s Chelsea apartment decked out with Australian flags.",
      "\u201cI normally have a small group of friends for dinner before the rest of the party arrives,\u201d Mr. Walters said. \u201cI invited Ray to this.\u201d",
      "Later, on their way to a bar with guests, the two lagged behind, and twirled around into a kiss.",
      "\u201cWe were giddy, and holding hands,\u201d Mr. Walters said, and the next evening they had tapas on their first official date at Salinas in West Chelsea, which became their favorite restaurant.",
      "They soon took turns seeing each other every weekend via Amtrak Acela, and in March took a trip to St. Barths, which they both described as the \u201cmagical acknowledgment of each other.\u201d",
      "By May, to slow things down, they took what they called an \u201cintermission.\u201d Six weeks later when Mr. Quintero flew into New York in June after celebrating world gay pride in Tel Aviv, they reunited at a fund-raiser for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.",
      "\u201cMaybe we\u2019re ready for Act Two,\u201d Mr. Quintero said \u201cWe\u2019re going to make this act the one that lasts.\u201d",
      "That summer they went to Fire Island several times and in September they vacationed in Spain.",
      "In March 2020, when the pandemic hit, they quarantined with friends on Fire Island for a month, and then rented their own place along the water for another three months.",
      "\u201cWe had never cooked and leaned into our recipes,\u201d said Mr. Walters, \u201cand made lasagna and enchiladas.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur friends named us the chefettes,\u201d he added, and soon they proudly donned black aprons with \u201cchefettes\u201d printed in teal.",
      "On a whim, in June, Mr. Walters got down on one knee for a pre-proposal before the two identical platinum bands he had ordered online arrived. Two days later, with rings in hand, his real proposal was thwarted by the bees. But that evening came success. Mr. Walters got down on one knee on their balcony as the moon rose over the ocean. After Mr. Walters proposed, Mr. Quintero got the other ring from where Mr. Walters had hidden it. Then he got down on one knee and proposed.",
      "\u201cI have since embraced bees,\u201d said Mr. Quintero, who from that day overcame his phobia, and in November 2022 they celebrated their engagement on St. Barths, where they also planned to celebrate their union.",
      "On April 21, Madeline Plasencia, on the city clerk\u2019s staff, officiated at their civil ceremony at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, with their mutual friend, who introduced them, as their witness.",
      "Then, on May 6, they planned to exchange vows at the Le Sereno hotel on St. Barths, before 64 guests. \u201cIt\u2019s not only empowering to overcome the fear of bees,\u201d Mr. Quintero said, \u201cbut also to choose to get married in the place we fell in love and bring together friends and family closest to us.\u201d"

      "He loves taking in the manicured gardens, the mazes, one of the world\u2019s oldest zoos still in existence, and one of the largest Baroque orangeries in the world. \u201cI go there to wander around the beauty,\u201d he said, as do the tourists who can visit for an entrance fee of $22 and up.",
      "But once in a while things can feel a little weird in a way that is unique to Mr. Habsburg.",
      "\u201cThere is a bedroom inside the palace that would have been mine if I was crown prince,\u201d he said, noting that he knows which one it is. \u201cThe first time I visited this place on a class trip when I was 14, I just thought, \u2018I would never arrange my room like that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mr. Habsburg is the 25-year-old heir apparent to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. His great-grandfather was Charles I, the last emperor of Austria and the king of Hungary. Before him, other ancestors ruled for more than 600 years, presiding over a vast global empire. ",
      "In 1918, at the end of World War I, Austria became a republic, and \u200cthe Habsburgs (often rendered as \u201cHapsburg\u201d in English) were dethroned and sent into exile. Charles I died on the Portuguese island of Madeira in 1922. The Habsburgs were allowed back into Austria if they renounced their claims to rule, which Mr. Habsburg\u2019s grandfather Otto did in 1961. In 1966, he returned ",
      ".",
      "Today Austria is a democratic republic with a president, chancellor and Parliament, and while some members of the former ruling family, like Mr. Habsburg himself, are living in Austria again, they still have no power or privilege. Instead, he is an ordinary citizen \u2014 one who races cars in the FIA World Endurance Championshipand lives in an apartment in Vienna with his 22-year-old sister, Gloria Habsburg-Lothringen. ",
      "When he visits the Capuchin crypt in Vienna, the place his grandparents lay and where he and his father, Karl von Habsburg, will most likely be laid to rest, he sometimes has to pay the nearly $10 entrance fee like other tourists. ",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little crazy,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s my lying place, but I still have to pay to visit.\u201d",
      "Of course, royalty is in the air this weekend, with ",
      " of England on Saturday. But the coronation is happening at a time when people are questioning exactly what a monarch of any country actually does. ",
      "In King Charles\u2019s case, \u201cyes, there is a throne,\u201d said Rachel Burchfield, contributing royal editor to Marie Claire, \u201cbut are the monarchs puppets or puppet masters?\u201d All the British working royals have causes they care about \u2014 Charles is famous for his work on climate change; William, Prince of Wales, has the Earthshot Prize; and Catherine, Princess of Wales, focuses on early childhood development \u2014 but much of what they still do is walkabouts, tours and ribbon cuttings.",
      "\u201cThey may not be able to make political change, but they have influence,\u201d Ms. Burchfeld said. ",
      "\u201cKate even has enormous influence even by the clothes she wears,\u201d she added.",
      "The Habsburgs aren\u2019t close to the British royals, said Robert Seydel, an Austrian historian and royal expert, which is perhaps why they were not invited to the coronation. \u201cThe Catholic monarchies kind of stick together, and the other monarchies stick together,\u201d Mr. Seydel said. The British royal family oversees the Church of England; Charles is now the supreme governor. Mr. Habsburg is a Catholic \u2014 a progressive one, he said \u2014 so devout that he carries a rosary with him at all times.",
      "There are other royal families who no longer have thrones. For example, there is still a queen of Greece, Queen Anne-Marie, even though the monarchy was abolished in 1973 and she holds no power. (Her husband, King Constantine II of Greece, ",
      ". They both lived in exile for decades, only moving back to Greece in 2013.)",
      "\u201cThere are many cases of people who were born into a royal family and are technically a prince or princess, but their family isn\u2019t on the throne,\u201d Ms. Burchfield said. With no official role, their situations \u2014 what work they do, what titles they have \u2014 vary. Some royal experts call them \u201croyal adjacent.\u201d",
      "Mr. Habsburg has a name fit for a king \u2014 Ferdinand Zvonimir Maria Balthus Keith Michael Otto Antal Bahnam Leonhard von Habsburg-Lothringen \u2014 but no palaces, no crown and no golden carriages to go with it.",
      "He also has a title: archduke of Austria, royal prince of Hungary, and would be addressed as Imperial and Royal Highness \u2026 if only Austrian law didn\u2019t make it illegal for him to use it in the country. (The admirers who slide into his DMs and address him as \u201cImperial and Royal Highness\u201d don\u2019t seem to care.) ",
      "Mr. Habsburg has no role in government and no diplomatic power. Yet he sometimes meets with the pope and represents the family at Vatican gatherings where he is given a seat of honor. (",
      ", a relative, is Hungary\u2019s ambassador to the Holy See.)",
      "Mr. Habsburg will oversee one thing when his father dies: the Order of the Golden Fleece, an order of chivalry founded in 1430 (all members are males and Christian). Members, including multiple heads of states, meet once a year to discuss the important issues of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s like a think tank,\u201d Mr. von Habsburg, the father, said.",
      "Mr. Habsburg runs in some royal circles \u2014 \u201cI know the royal family in Bulgaria quite well, because my sister went to school with some\u201d \u2014 but feels uncomfortable being part of others. ",
      "\u201cI have my friends,\u201d he said, and these friends include the owner of a natural wine bar, a painter and a puppeteer for the opera. ",
      "There is, of course, the complex reality that the most traumatic event to happen to his family \u2014 losing the empire \u2014 is what gave him something he cherishes: his freedom.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather, he was the last crown prince \u2014 he had to grow up with his dad as emperor and his mom empress,\u201d Mr. Habsburg said. \u201cAs a kid he had to have all the training and learn 10 languages, and it\u2019s hard work being a royal. It\u2019s all events and openings and hospital visits.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my family and what they\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I get to live a different life.\u201d",
      "Mr. Habsburg was born in Salzburg, Austria, to Mr. von Habsburg, a politician, and Francesca von Thyssen-Bornemisza, an art collector and curator. His parents are divorced; his father, 62, lives in Vienna and Porto, Portugal, and his mother, 64, lives in Madrid. Besides his roommate Gloria, a documentary film producer, Mr. Habsburg has one other sister: Eleonore Habsburg D\u2019Ambrosio, 29, a jewelry designer who lives in Oxford, England, with her husband J\u00e9r\u00f4me D\u2019Ambrosio, a former Formula E driver. ",
      "The Habsburgs \u2014 there are about 600 of them living today, he said \u2014",
      "try to keep in touch. \u201cWe have a WhatsApp group,\u201d Mr. Habsburg said. \u201cI can travel anywhere in the world, and I text the group and say where I\u2019m going and when, and there is a house I can stay at.\u201d He added with a laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s like a free Airbnb for us Habsburgs.\u201d",
      "The freedom is something that might make certain other royals jealous. \u201cFerdinand doesn\u2019t have a throne, but he has individualized power,\u201d Ms. Burchfield said. \u201cFor these other royals where the throne is active, they don\u2019t have a ton of power, they are very much boxed in.\u201d",
      "There is one person who is delighted Mr. Habsburg gets to pursue his passions: Kathleen Schurmans, the co-chief executive of his racing team, WRT: \u201cIf there was an empire he wouldn\u2019t be able to race cars.\u201d",
      "Indeed, on a recent weekend morning, Mr. Habsburg was at the track at Portimao, in the Algarve region of Portugal, working his way around the garage before a race. There were some 60 mechanics and engineers, many of whom he greeted by name, pulling one into a hug. ",
      "Mr. Habsburg is so magnanimous and upbeat around the racetrack he once got publicly called out",
      "by the Formula One driver Nyck de Vries for not acting serious enough. \u201cI dealt with it by trying to outperform him,\u201d Ferdinand said, laughing. (He said they now have a good relationship.)",
      "Ever since he got into a go-kart at the age of 7, Mr. Habsburg has been addicted to motor sports. \u201cI was like, every single day asking the nanny to drive me to go karting,\u201d he said. He got good enough grades at the Danube International School, his private high school, to get by so he could spend more time on the tracks. He skipped university to move to London and join an F3 team, one of the starting points for those with F1 aspirations.",
      "He got into endurance racing instead, whose races last six to 24 hours. (Drivers work as a team, taking turns making hundreds of laps.) In 2021 he won Le Mans, a 24-hour race in northwestern France that is widely considered to be the world\u2019s most prestigious sports-car race.",
      "Before drivers are salaried they have to raise a hefty amount of money \u2014 six or even seven figures \u2014 to join a team. Many have independent funds or relentlessly court sponsors who dictate their whereabouts.",
      "When Mr. Habsburg first started, he was funded by his mother. Ms. von Thyssen-Bornemisza\u2019s family had made a fortune in steel and energy. Now he has all the sponsors he needs, he said: \u201cI won\u2019t have to ask my mom for money again.\u201d",
      "Karl von Habsburg is warm. In Portimao, he was beaming at his son when he was racing and gave him a huge hug after he came in a devastating seventh place. But he\u2019s also a serious person, having been born in exile in Bavaria. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I was an Austrian citizen and had an Austrian passport,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it came with the remark that it was valid for all countries in the world except Austria.\u201d ",
      "His grandfather, Charles I, tried twice to regain the Hungarian crown in 1921 without success. Some staff members still referred to his father, Otto, as Imperial Highness.",
      "Both Mr. von Habsburg and Otto found solace serving in the European Parliament. \u201cOtto and Karl have worked very, very hard on the process of bringing these former eastern European communist countries back to Europe again to work together,\u201d said Mario Christian Ortner, an Austrian military historian. \u201cThis was also one of the main missions of the Habsburg empire, to get these different nations to work together.\u201d ",
      "In the interwar period and during World War II, the House of Habsburg \u201cwas a vehement opponent of the Nazis,\u201d Mr. Seydel said. Otto, in particular, campaigned against the Nazis in France and the United States so much so that the Nazis ",
      " against him. He also used his ",
      " to help tens of thousands of Austrians, including 15,000 Jews, escape. Mr. von Habsburg is currently working to rally Europe to help Ukraine.",
      "Overall, Mr. von Habsburg feels a strong responsibility to serve people, whether it\u2019s his family or Europeans, however he can. \u201cWhat I want to instill in all the members of the family is that if you are suddenly in the position where you have to take responsibility for your society, you should be taking it,\u201d he said.",
      "His son has gotten the message. Mr. Habsburg has a campaign, Drive Fast, Act Faster, that encourages racing teams to reduce and offset their carbon emissions. His current team, WRT, switched to green energy at its factory and uses fuel made from waste products of the wine industry.",
      "In Vienna Mr. Habsburg is part of a Catholic community, Center John-Paul II, who are trying to make holy places approachable for young people. He prides himself on being open to those who may not be accepted in more traditional Catholic circles. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve had a criminal record or been divorced or had an abortion or are gay,\u201d Mr. Habsburg said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about loving each other.\u201d",
      "He does not second-guess his family\u2019s circumstance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to grow up without that feeling of loss,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad kind of gave me permission to enjoy it, all the history.\u201d",
      "When his mind does wonder what it would be like if the empire still existed, it\u2019s more of a casual curiosity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Hmm, that would have been interesting,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen I go back to living my life.\u201d"

      "Bethany Ann Ryan and Andrew Robin Jones spent almost three decades living parallel lives without ever meeting.",
      "They were born in the same hospital \u2014 one year apart. They grew up in the same suburb of Sydney, Australia, attended the same preschool and neighboring high schools. As teenagers they even attended the same parties.",
      "But it took until November 2018, a week before Ms. Ryan \u2014 then in her late twenties \u2014 was set to move out of the suburb she grew up in and into the bustle of downtown Sydney, about 20 miles away, that they finally came into each other\u2019s lives. At least digitally.",
      "With moving boxes piled up, Ms. Ryan sank down onto her bed to catch a break from packing and idly opened up the dating app Bumble. \u201cShould I even be swiping?\u201d Ms. Ryan remembered thinking, realizing that her dating radius on the app was about to change.",
      "That afternoon of swiping led Ms. Ryan to Mr. Jones. The two traded messages through the Christmas and New Year holidays, until they agreed to meet up in downtown Sydney, near Ms. Ryan\u2019s new place.",
      "Over dumplings, they bonded over their shared love of food, favorite neighborhoods in Sydney and the Australian bush \u2014 a colloquial term used by Australians to describe the wooded areas outside of the coast. They left the date unaware that they shared a hometown as well.",
      "Three months into dating, Ms. Ryan showed Mr. Jones photos from her childhood. Peering at a photo of a young Ms. Ryan in front of her preschool classroom, Mr. Jones immediately recognized the school. He asked if that was Binnowee Kindergarten. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did he know?\u201d",
      "He knew, of course, because he had also attended the same preschool. He was a student in 1994 and 1995; she in 1993 and 1994. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Mr. Jones said. From the time that picture was taken, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t meet each other for almost 30 years.\u201d",
      "Ms. Ryan, 33, grew up in West Pennant Hills, a suburb of Sydney. She is a group account director at Dentsu Creative, an advertising agency. Mr. Jones, 32, also grew up in West Pennant Hills and is an electrician. He started his own company, Tier 1 Electrical\u00a0&& Data, in 2019. They now live together in Sydney.",
      "In April 2019, the pair made their relationship official. That month, they joined friends for an outdoor party to celebrate Anzac Day, the Australian national holiday commemorating Australians and New Zealanders who have served in the military. Mr. Jones assumed his natural position: grilling wings by the fire pit.",
      "\u201cI looked over and I could see he was talking to people, he was laughing, he was in this light,\u201d Ms. Ryan said, \u201cand I just thought: That\u2019s my person.\u201d",
      "The next year, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the two moved in together.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been good with my hands,\u201d Mr. Jones said. So, he crafted an engagement ring for Ms. Ryan and invited her on a camping trip. Over tea in the Australian bush, he proposed.",
      "\u201cApril is our month,\u201d Ms. Ryan said. It\u2019s when the two made their relationship official, when they were engaged and when they married.",
      "As lovers of the outdoors, the duo wanted a wedding venue in a remote setting. \u201cPomp and circumstance can distract from what a marriage and a wedding really is, which is just two people",
      "Ms. Ryan said.",
      "On April 22, the couple was married at the Australian Bushland Weddings venue just outside of Sydney. Broderick Collins, a minister for the Community of Christ, officiated in front of 110 guests.",
      "Ms. Ryan wore a red gown. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked white,\u201d she said.",

      "They arrive from the port with their colorful clothes and their well-worn musical instruments, parading through the village and performing at the various squares. Islanders view them with a mix of awe and wonder.",
      "At times they look like superheroes, moving together to the rhythm of the music, conjuring tricks like magicians.",
      "I first heard of the Sea Clown Sailing Circus when I was following the stories of refugees crossing Greece. Members of the circus were performing at a camp in Athens, trying to win smiles from children who had experienced too much pain.",
      "Later, I joined the performers in the summer of 2020 on the storied island of Ithaca, in the Ionian Sea. Hoping to sail with the nomad crew, I happened to arrive the very day their engine broke down. Apparently it was a regular occurrence. A technician from the island mocked them: The engines were rusting from lack of use, he said.",
      "It was true that Fred Normal and Alvaro Ramirez, the captains, never wanted to use the engines, aiming instead to sail with the wind as much as possible \u2014 even while docking at and departing from the port.",
      "Twenty years earlier, in the United States, Fred, an Alaska-born circus performer, decided it was pointless to try to change the world while traveling with gas-guzzling trucks and caravans. Instead, he resolved to offer his form of utopia to people across the United States and Europe by bicycle. He rode around with his crew from one town to the next, staging pop-up shows and sleeping beside campfires.",
      "Eventually, on the Southern coast of Italy, he met Nikoleta Giakumeli, a Greek acrobat, and Alvaro, a Uruguayan clown who had been traveling around Europe. Together, the trio dreamed up the idea of a seaborne circus, even though none of them had ever formally sailed.",
      "So they learned. For 13 years, Fred and Nikoleta lived on their boat, Surloulou, through summers and winters. After the birth of their daughter, Sirena, who at the age of 4 is already climbing ropes and trying her first tricks as an acrobat, their lives changed dramatically. They now spend less time with the circus, which, despite their absence, continues reinventing itself with new performers and new ideas.",
      "Dozens of artists from all over the world are connected with the Sea Clown Sailing Circus. Some join the crew for only a few days; others join for the whole summer. But a core group of around seven or eight people are trying to bring the circus to a greater acclaim \u2014 not only by roaming freely from one Greek island to another, but also by producing more meaningful, and more philosophically engaging, shows.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when I joined the Sea Clowns again for a month, they were producing a new show based on Plato\u2019s ",
      ". I saw firsthand how dedicated the performers are to their craft. Though their performances often feel impromptu, the Sea Clowns are in fact immensely disciplined in their preparations. Every act \u2014 from acrobatic shows and fire juggling to aerial rope tricks and slacklining \u2014 requires a tremendous degree of skill and training. And they simply love to learn.",
      "Being a part of the crew requires being good at sailing, music or circus acts, and ideally all three. But what\u2019s most important is the ability to express enough humor, kindness and respect to live in proximity with a crew of curious artists every day without creating tensions.",
      "It\u2019s also a challenge, of course, to adapt to life on a shoestring budget. \u201cWe live or we die by the hat,\u201d Fred would say at the end of every show, inviting the public to offer a donation for the Sea Clowns\u2019 survival.",
      "The life of a street (or water) artist is fragile, delicate \u2014 like a tightrope act, or juggling with knives, or sailing through a storm. Yet for most of the crew, nothing seems to offer them a greater sense of freedom. The Sea Clowns ride with their sails open to the wind, confronting both their dreams and an unpredictable future.",
      "\u201cOur work aims to show that nothing is impossible,\u201d Alvaro said, \u201cunless your mind convinces you to believe the opposite.\u201d"

      "As spring bursts forth, wild turkeys begin the mating game. Groups congregate in lawns and fields \u2014 and sometimes in the middle of the street. Males puff out their iridescent feathers, fan their tails and drag their wings on the ground in a vie for the right to breed. Their faces and necks turn dazzling shades of blue and red.",
      "Once rare and elusive denizens of America\u2019s woodlands, these heaviest of the galliform birds (chickens and their relatives) have gone urban. Wild turkeys live in the residential neighborhoods around my home in Madison, Wis.",
      "A few years ago, their elaborate courtship displays fascinated me so much that I began to photograph them \u2014 and, as I\u2019ve learned, there\u2019s more happening than meets the eye.",
      "For starters, turkeys of a feather flock together. Males, known as toms, can form lifelong flocks with their brothers. Dr. Alan Krakauer, a ",
      " and fellow ",
      ", studied this as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He ",
      " that toms in a flock were anywhere from full to half-siblings. These bands of brothers cooperated to court females, or hens, and chase off competing males.",
      "Remarkably, though, only the dominant male mated and fathered offspring. The subordinate brothers served as \u201cwingmen,\u201d \u201cbodyguards,\u201d or \u201cbackup dancers,\u201d to use Dr. Krakauer\u2019s colorful descriptions. \u201cThey have what I think of as a support role,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite the potential for lifelong celibacy, wingmen benefited from the arrangement, Dr. Krakauer found \u2014 at least by the raw calculus of evolution. On average, dominant males with wingmen produced seven offspring a season, whereas solo males produced fewer than one. Since the males were closely related, those seven offspring contained more of the wingmen\u2019s genes than if they\u2019d sired a single chick themselves.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re helping their brother get a lot more females than either of them would get on their own, so this cooperation seemed particularly helpful,\u201d explained Dr. Krakauer. \u201cThat seemed to be surprising for people at the time.\u201d",
      "Anyone who\u2019s had a brother knows the vicissitudes of fraternal relations. While brothers generally cooperate during the mating season, intense fighting breaks out at other times, as they jostle for rank. Turkeys have formidable weapons: large bodies, powerful wings and spurred feet. On one occasion, I saw a fight so violent that spittle flew \u2014 like when a boxer is hit by a knockout punch.",
      "While males are aggressive with each other, they aren\u2019t aggressive toward females and do not force copulations, despite being twice the size of their mating partners. So while males may strut with abandon, females ultimately choose their mates. They\u2019re picky about partners and know what they want: males with long snoods.",
      "Snoods are the fingerlike fleshy protuberances that flop over a turkey\u2019s beak. The animals can contract and relax muscles and blood vessels in their head and neck, causing changes in the organ\u2019s length and color. A tom sporting a long red snood draws the attention of hens like flies to honey \u2014 although, to their credit, the hens manage to be coy about it.",
      "Dr. Richard Buchholz, ",
      " at the University of Mississippi, has spent his career studying wild turkeys. He examined the role that various male ornaments \u2014 including snoods, caruncles (pebble-like bumps on the head and neck), skullcaps (thickened skin on top of the head), spurs (talons on the legs) and beards (tufts of hairlike feathers projecting from the chest) \u2014 play in female mate choice. He ",
      " that snood length was the primary factor that explained which male a female chose as a mate. Even a few extra millimeters made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt did surprise me, especially since the snood doesn\u2019t seem to be a very functional thing to choose,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. \u201cWhy the snood and not all the other ornaments on males?\u201d",
      "The answer lies in a phenomenon with deep roots in biology: Fancy accouterments may indicate good genes. For turkeys, a male who can afford to sport a killer snood must have had ample resources, which ostensibly reflects the quality of his DNA. Dr. Buchholz found that males with longer snoods had fewer coccidia parasites, which don\u2019t harm adults but can sicken or kill chicks, and ",
      " that may make them resistant to coccidia.",
      "\u201cEarly on there\u2019s probably a big impact on chick survival,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said, so by choosing longer-snooded males, females may provide their babies with lifesaving parasite resistance.",
      "Dr. Buchholz is still uncertain about the role some other male ornaments play. Like snoods, other fleshy structures on a turkey\u2019s face and neck can change color during displays. For example, males will drain all the blood from the caruncles so they\u2019re as white as a sheet of paper, Dr. Buchholz said. He remains unsure of what the change in the caruncles might signal, or why it\u2019s important.",
      "And what about those fancy feathers? \u201cI don\u2019t know if females care,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. The feathers of male turkeys infected with coccidia ",
      ", which turkeys (but not we humans) can see. However, no one has studied whether females scoff at dull feathers the way they do at puny snoods.",
      "There\u2019s still a lot to learn about wild turkey mating behavior. \u201cFor a bird that\u2019s such a great conservation success story, that\u2019s so common and interesting to people, and that has a cultural connection to the American Thanksgiving, for us to not know more about its behavior is really a shame,\u201d said Dr. Buchholz.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s not entirely surprising. Wild turkey populations are currently ",
      " in many parts of the country, thanks to conservation efforts; in places like New England, Madison and Berkeley, they\u2019re now so common that they get about as much notice from passing motorists as a traffic cone.",
      "But that wasn\u2019t always the case. Until recently, wild turkeys were rare in the United States \u2014 \u201cwhich seems crazy now,\u201d Dr. Krakauer said, \u201csince they\u2019re right in town and blocking traffic.\u201d"

      "Ten-year-old Harbor Eaton lives with her family on ",
      " on Maine\u2019s Schoodic Peninsula. The Eaton family primarily grows produce crops, but balsam-harvesting and wreath-making is a way of extending the farm\u2019s production into the colder, darker seasons. In November and December, Harbor goes out tipping with her family and farm workers on adjacent woodlots, with the aid of their horses, Andy and Starr.",
      "\u201cYou go out into the woods, try to find a tree with good foliage. You take a branch, snap it and make sure it doesn\u2019t have brown spots on it \u2014 \u2019cause you don\u2019t want a brown wreath,\u201d Harbor explained.",
      "Cedar, Harbor\u2019s 7-year-old brother, said that the trick is to use a stick that\u2019s sharpened on one end \u2014 with four branch stubs sticking out \u2014 to stack and collect the boughs into a portable unit.",
      "\u201cDo that over and over till you have filled the stick with branches,\u201d Cedar said. \u201cThen you put the stick on the wagon. You do it all over again until the horses pull us home with all the full sticks.\u201d",
      "Balsam-harvesting is a welcome change of pace for farmers at the end of the season\u2019s crescendo. \u201cAfter spending the majority of our time focusing our energy on the soil and working looking down, we get into the woods and just stare at the trees, looking up toward the sky,\u201d said Liz Moran, who manages Darthia Farm and raises Harbor and Cedar with her partner, Steve Eaton, known as Shepsi.",
      "The process of tipping is hard work: the physical picking and pulling, the weight of the heavy branches. Tippers also need to keep an ear out for hunters in the forests, and pull off ticks at day\u2019s end. But Ms. Moran describes a certain magic about the work: bringing warm treats to eat, noticing the soft patterns in the branches, letting the children play as they work, listening for the barred owl that lives near the entrance of the woodlot. The crew sometimes sing while they work, their voices echoing off the trees.",
      "\u201cThe woods offer such a different acoustic environment than the open gardens and fields,\u201d Mr. Eaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to hear each other in the woods if we are singing.\u201d",
      "In Maine, especially in the state\u2019s Downeast region, generations of people have built lives on seasonal, nature-based work: digging clams, pulling traps on commercial fishing boats, raking blueberries, processing seafood and crops. Harvesting balsam and making wreaths play important roles in this cycle.",
      "Geri Valentine started making wreaths in the 1970s, and it\u2019s still a part of her patchwork of seasonal jobs. As she wire-wrapped handfuls of evergreen around metal rings in a cozy cabin on Darthia Farm, she recalled her early days as a wreather. \u201cBack then, it was mostly a cottage industry \u2014 people would go out in family groups to gather brush,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople like clam diggers and fishermen would go out brushing after the fishing season was over, and it was a way to bring in some income, especially right before Christmas, heading into the lean months.\u201d",
      "Ms. Valentine has chosen a simple life. She lives in a cabin in the town of Addison without electricity and running water; she grows her own food with friends; she drives a used car. \u201cI don\u2019t want very much,\u201d she said. \u201cI change my jobs with the seasons.\u201d",
      "\u201cLiving this way feels very grounded,\u201d she continued. These days, though, people can\u2019t survive as easily on seasonal work, she said. \u201cIf you have a truck payment, if you\u2019ve got a mortgage, if you want to send your kids to college, you can\u2019t swing a life of digging clams in the summer and making wreaths for Christmastime.\u201d",
      "When you talk to locals, they agree: The systems have changed. The bigger wreath manufacturers, including Kelco Industries, Worcester Wreath Co. and Whitney Wreath, likely made the ones you find at your local grocery store or in catalogs. By some estimates, such companies employ about 2,000 migrant workers to harvest materials and work in wreath factories in Downeast Maine \u2014 often the same workers who harvested wild blueberries in summer and who returned to Maine for wreath season.",
      "Among the migrant workers, there have been growing concerns about low wages, substandard housing, exploitative work conditions and a lack of access to health care and education. Nonprofits like ",
      " and the ",
      " provide support to seasonal workers, including those employed by the wreath industry.",
      "This year, local nonprofits collaborated with farmers to gather warm clothes, blankets and supplies for wreath workers who are often unprepared for the cold of New England in November and December. Mounds of donated goods piled up at drop-off sites \u2014 enough that Bo Dennis, a flower farmer and organizer, borrowed a clean cattle trailer to carry it all to Mano en Mano\u2019s office in Milbridge.",
      "Mr. Dennis grows flowers at his farm, ",
      ", in Monroe, Maine, and is also on staff at ",
      ", where he works on programs for beginner farmers. He offers his farmland for other queer farmers to find an entry point to agriculture and rural life. He\u2019s tuned in to the networks of people and plants around him and the ways they may need support \u2014 and this mind-set extends to the forests.",
      "\u201cWhen we harvest, we are pruning a tree,\u201d Mr. Dennis said, explaining that tippers only cut the last 12 to 15 inches of a tree branch \u2014 a sustainable practice. He loaded heavy bags of boughs into his truck, all harvested from a friend\u2019s woodlot, a chunk of clear-cut land that had grown in with thick, scrubby trees.",
      "Mr. Dennis mainly harvests balsam fir, supplemented with cedar, pine and juniper. He is careful about where he harvests, and on whose land. \u201cAs a trans person, I\u2019m hyper-aware that I want to have consent with anything I\u2019m doing, including having consent to the land,\u201d he said.",
      "By percentage, Maine is the most forested state in America; about ",
      ", most of which is privately owned. Independent tippers usually (but ",
      ") get permission from private landowners to gather materials on their land \u2014 and, as with deer hunters or wild mushroom gatherers, tippers often know whom to ask and where to find what they need.",
      ", a forager and artist who uses the name Giant Daughter, looks in a variety of places: overgrown properties that might benefit from pruning, weedy land, areas with trees too thick for them all to thrive. \u201cI also harvest at abandoned sites,\u201d she said, \u201clike an abandoned Burger King that no one is tending to.\u201d",
      "Ms. Alexandrou uses her background in horticulture and farming to influence the ways she gathers her materials. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be taking away,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be using what makes sense to use.\u201d",
      "\u201cI pay attention to the way the plants are growing so that I know my harvesting is good for the ecosystem I\u2019m harvesting from,\u201d she added.",
      "Most tippers will wait for three hard frosts before they harvest. If you bend a balsam bough in the summer, it won\u2019t snap; after a few frosts, it will. The frost allows the branches to be harvested easily, at the right time in the tree\u2019s growth cycle. This year, though, the frosts were worryingly erratic. It was warm enough to harvest in a T-shirt on some days.",
      "Weather patterns, tides, fish, frosts, deer \u2014 these can be the favored conversational subjects in rural Maine. Tipping, too, offers common ground.",
      "\u201cI may have nothing to do with someone most of the year,\u201d Mr. Eaton said, \u201cbut if I\u2019m tipping, there is much to relate to.\u201d",
      "Every so often, while working in the woods, the tippers stop to smell their hands. They smell like pitch, like the inside of trees. Dirt mingles with the sap. I see it over and over: tippers cupping their palms to their face and pulling pine needles from their hair. The smell is earthy and nostalgic. The wreaths will smell this way, too: joyful circles on front doors across the country, formed by the work of strangers, and made from trees that continue to grow."

I\u2019d start with a 39-year-old hayseed \u2014 thin as a fence post and prickly as barbed wire \u2014 assaulting her typewriter on the ninth floor of the Nebraska State Capitol as a local bank teller plunges 135 feet to his death on the stone transept below. Perhaps I\u2019d cut to the fingernail marks he left on the observation deck five floors above, or the note he left behind. I\u2019d then creep slowly back up to Sandoz, red hair in a French bun, hands on her hips, standing quietly \u2014 even knowingly \u2014 at the window while her co-workers at the historical society buzz around her.",
      "Roll credits.",
      "Born and raised in the remote ",
      ", roughly 400 miles west of Lincoln, the author Mari Sandoz plowed her way into the literary canon of the Great Plains \u2014 just months after the teller\u2019s leap \u2014 when she finally published ",

      ", \u201cone feels that one has read the history of all pioneering.\u201d Before her death from bone cancer in 1966, she would publish 18 more, fiction and nonfiction alike, enshrining her status \u2014 alongside ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and others \u2014 as one of the most cleareyed chroniclers of the American frontier.",
      "I\u2019ve long felt a certain kinship with Sandoz. I, too, fled the Sandhills. I, too, graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I, too, began my writing career in the city. And I, too, sometimes chafe at my New York editors. \u201cDamn it, you and I know the East has long bled the west white, is still doing it, and I\u2019m to distort facts to please a book public,\u201d ",
      " to a friend. \u201cWhy, I\u2019d rather write my own way and dig ditches for my soup and hard tack than write lies for a yacht and sables. Row boat and rabbit\u2019s more my style anyway.\u201d",
      "Sandoz would eventually leave Lincoln, first for Denver and then for New York, but she spent more years in Nebraska\u2019s capital city than anywhere else. And though she criticized Lincoln throughout her career \u2014 calling it \u201cthe last word in decadent middle-class towns\u201d and \u201cparticularly unkind\u201d to writers \u2014 she would eventually soften on the city. Sort of. In a short essay for The Lincoln Star, the former morning newspaper, in 1959, she wrote, \u201cI remember Lincoln as our Greenwich Village,\u201d recalling long hours in cheap coffee shops and the hungry underclass of would-be artists and writers with whom she often commiserated: the poet ",
      ", the philosopher ",
      " and the short-story writer ",
      ", among others.",
      "So here I am, home again, half drunk and squinting beneath the Capitol, hoping to glean something more about Sandoz and the city she so loved to hate, or perhaps so hated to love. I\u2019ve returned to see this sprawling city of roughly 300,000 people \u2014 where the skyline sprouts from the rail yard and the subdivisions spill into the cornfields; where the streets are treed, but the wetlands are paved; where the U.N.L. campus hums in the heart of the city and the Capitol beckons from miles away \u2014 through the eyes of its most vocal and most ambivalent critic.",
      "Concealing a bottle of cheap ros\u00e9, my wife and I crane our necks. We stare. Nebraskans often call the Capitol tower the \u201cPenis of the Plains,\u201d and truthfully, there\u2019s no debating its phallic structure: 15 floors of Indiana limestone standing erect above the city, capped with a dome of golden tiles and \u2014 as if to avoid any confusion \u2014 a 19-foot bronze statue called ",
      " casting his seed to the wind.",
      "But I\u2019m fixated on the teller\u2019s jump, instead. I squint, he falls. I squint, he falls. And I wonder how Sandoz might have interpreted the same. In those hollow hours before she burst onto the national stage, nary a book to her name, rejections mounting like unpaid bills, she must have borne a certain empathy for the bank teller. Her own family worried she might commit suicide, so far adrift from her literary ambitions, and she once wrote that after so many revisions of \u201cOld Jules,\u201d \u201cI could have jumped off the Capitol too, but it wouldn\u2019t have improved the book particularly.\u201d",
      "I squint. She falls.",

      ", then 92 and a pioneer of public television, beneath the stone columns of the ",
      ", one of the oldest structures on the U.N.L. campus. It was in the studio below, he told me, in the spring of 1959, that he produced a seven-part series called \u201cCreative Writing With Mari Sandoz\u201d for the university\u2019s educational television station. \u201cI would rather face a rattlesnake than that camera,\u201d he remembered her saying, but as their work together progressed, she slowly began to relax.",
      "\u201cQuite frankly, if there\u2019s one photograph of Mari Sandoz and me that I wish I had,\u201d Mr. Hull said, \u201cit\u2019s of the two of us dangling our legs off the loading dock, both smoking my Pall Malls.\u201d",
      "With an elfish charm and bushy white eyebrows, Mr. Hull neatly unpacked his memories of the author: her generosity with students, her underdog complex, her staunch liberalism, her retreat to New York and, finally, Nebraskans\u2019 general contempt for her second novel, ",
      " a thinly veiled allegory published in 1939 about the rise of fascism in the Midwest. Little did I know, of course, that just eight months later, Mr. Hull would, like Sandoz before him, be gone.",
      "\u201cI personally think \u2018Capital City\u2019 was a hate letter to Lincoln,\u201d Mr. Hull said. \u201cBut it was here that she found herself. These people gave her the tools, and I think she felt she owed Lincoln a lot.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s here on the Capitol grounds, where she often spent her summer nights, escaping the heat of her nearby apartment, that I feel most connected to Sandoz. She once wrote that it rose from the corn lands like a \u201csort of modern tall tale,\u201d and for years I understood this as a compliment, as if she could hardly believe its grandeur. There\u2019s no doubt she adored the building. But I wonder now, as the streetlamps blink on and the bats flutter overhead, if I haven\u2019t mistaken her intent. Perhaps by \u201ctall tale,\u201d she meant that the Capitol represented ideals \u2014 equality, justice, democracy \u2014 that the state had not yet realized, or maybe never would. Perhaps the double entendre was intentional. To be progressive in such a conservative state was then \u2014 and is now \u2014 to be perpetually caught between hope and despair.",
      "But while Nebraska is redder now that it\u2019s ever been, Lincoln itself leans relatively liberal and has evolved in some ways that Sandoz probably would have cherished. Forever a champion of the underdog, and the daughter of immigrants herself, Sandoz would very likely praise the city for its ",
      ", for example. As a fan of contemporary art, she would no doubt frequent both the ",
      " and the nearby ",
      ", too.",
      "As an avid walker, she would appreciate the more than 135 miles of hiking and biking trails that now crisscross the city, in addition to the numerous wildlife preserves just beyond it: ",
      ", the ",
      ", ",
      " and more. And of course she would cherish the city\u2019s bookstores, particularly ",
      ", which specializes in Nebraska literature, and ",
      ", Lincoln\u2019s newest, housed in the old ",
      " downtown.",
      "For a more intimate look at the author\u2019s life, I meet up the next afternoon with Jamison Wyatt, a Sandoz aficionado whom I first encountered in college nearly 15 years ago. He now works for the State Legislature and served, until recently, on the executive board of the ",
      ". And since 2014 \u2014 by request only \u2014 he has ushered Sandoz fans like me on a roughly mile-long walking tour of her life in the city. He calls it \u201cStalking the Ghost of Mari Sandoz,\u201d a play on one of her pitched-but-never-published essays about Crazy Horse, and issues a 24-page hand-bound booklet to everyone who attends. Today, that\u2019s just me and my parents, now tourists in their own city. It\u2019s a blistering 99 degrees. Not a cloud in sight.",
      "We start at the corner of 14th and P Streets, in the heart of downtown Lincoln, where Sandoz, then 23, attended Lincoln Business College just months after divorcing her first (and only) husband and fleeing her life as a rural schoolteacher in the Sandhills. We then move north to the welcome shade of campus, with stops at the former Teachers College \u2014 where Sandoz first enrolled \u2014 and the Social Sciences building, where she learned the fundamentals of her craft as a writer.",
      "From there, we head to the former department stores looming above O Street, the city\u2019s main drag, where Sandoz indulged her obsession with hats. Then to the old Lincoln Star building, where she took a part-time job as a copywriter, and past the ",
      ", where \u2014 in its previous iteration \u2014 she savored the coffee shop\u2019s free air-conditioning and wrote multiple drafts of \u201cOld Jules.\u201d",
      "I\u2019ve visited Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s ",
      " in Savannah, Ga.; H.L. Mencken\u2019s ",
      " in Baltimore; William Faulkner\u2019s ",
      " in Oxford, Miss.; the ",
      " in Key West, Fla.; and more. None of those tours were half as compelling as \u201cStalking the Ghost of Mari Sandoz.\u201d Not because her personal landmarks have been especially well preserved \u2014 in fact, most have been razed or renovated beyond recognition, including two of her former apartments \u2014 but because Mr. Wyatt\u2019s fascination with Sandoz is intoxicating.",
      "By the end of our nearly three-hour tour, I feel voyeuristic, as though I\u2019ve witnessed too much, and indeed, Mr. Wyatt\u2019s scholarship bleeds well beyond the pages of Sandoz\u2019s official biography. We know that her husband chased her from the Sandhills all the way to Lincoln, for example, where archival materials suggest he later cried on her doorstep. And we know, unlike most of her peers at U.N.L., that her greatest mentor, ",
      ", wasn\u2019t courting his favorite student, as the campus rag once suggested.",
      "\u201cHe was gay,\u201d says Mr. Wyatt, who explored the professor\u2019s queerness for his undergraduate thesis at U.N.L. In May 1941, Van den Bark was arrested with a younger man from Kansas and charged on scant evidence with \u201cimmorality,\u201d after which the chancellor demanded he resign. Sandoz, forever his friend and confidante, Mr. Wyatt explains, \u201cpretended like she didn\u2019t know where he went. But she knew.\u201d",
      "Mr. Wyatt later guides us through the Capitol\u2019s interior, from the yawning foyer bedecked with glittering murals to the parapet on the 14th floor. \u201cA fine place for thought,\u201d Sandoz once called it, with a sweeping view of the city.",
      "But down here on J Street, just steps from her old apartment, where Sandoz watched the monument rise, year after year, and the moon behind it, night after night, I\u2019m thinking again of her biopic. I\u2019m thinking of \u201cMist and the Tall White Tower,\u201d the short story she wrote not long after the teller\u2019s leap, about a young Sandhiller who flees his abusive caretaker \u2014 not Old Jules but Old Jillery \u2014 only to find himself on the Capitol parapet, one foot dangling over the ledge, struggling to reconcile life\u2019s disappointments, before finally pulling back from the brink. I\u2019d cut to her cluttered desk back home, a cigarette smoldering in the ashtray, and a letter addressed to The Atlantic Monthly sitting beside it.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose anyone will want to print this story,\u201d it reads",
      "\u201cBut you understand that it had to be written.\u201d"

      "I\u2019m deep in an Alaskan forest halfway through an 8K race when I find myself alone. Above me, 100-foot spruces bend and bellow, set upon by wind so loud I mistake it for an airplane. Below me, a slushy, icy mess of a trail.",
      "Ahead of me \u2014 no one.",
      "It\u2019s a drizzly November morning. My clothes are wet with rain and my fingers and toes hurt from the cold. I look down at my black running shoes, willing them to move faster. They don\u2019t.",
      "I can no longer see the two women I followed for the first half of the run, and I imagine the gap widening. Then I picture myself on a map: a speck some 4,000 miles away from my home in South Florida. I see my 7-year-old daughter\u2019s chubby cheeks and dirty blond curls, my 5-year-old son with his thumb in his mouth.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to die here, alone,\u201d I think. In the past, I never had thoughts like this. I was all swagger: Back when I lived in Jerusalem, I ran on isolated trails in the forest almost every afternoon. But since filing for divorce in August, I\u2019ve become fearful of being alone. And being in Alaska \u2014 with its vastness, the way it dangles, lonely, at the edge of the continent \u2014 has only magnified those feelings.",
      "I try to catch up with the women, but I\u2019m tapped out, No. 12 in a field of a dozen. I worry: What if everyone finishes and goes home? I don\u2019t have my phone; there will be no way for me to call for help.",
      "And then I ask myself: Why did I come all the way to Alaska on the advice of a total stranger, to chase something I\u2019m not even sure I believe in \u2014 an astrological event called a solar return?",
      "A solar return takes place at the moment when the sun returns to exactly the same location in the sky where it was at the time of your birth, explained Julia Mihas, a San Francisco-based astrologer. This usually takes place every year on or near your birthday.",
      "The thinking behind solar return trips is that just as the place where you\u2019re born has an impact on your birth chart \u2014 which supposedly reveals major themes in your life story \u2014 so can the place where you spend your solar return affect the year ahead. In essence, an astrologer, using your yearly chart, searches for the place where the stars will be most auspicious at the moment of your solar return, and then you travel to that location. It\u2019s like hacking your horoscope.",
      "These trips, known as aimed solar returns, or A.S.R.s, are central to an approach called active astrology, which holds that you can intervene in your fate.",
      "Let me confess that I\u2019m a little woo-woo. I recently bought a small piece of Libyan desert glass \u2014 which is supposed to work with chakras or vibrations or whatever \u2014 and hung it over my desk. But solar return trips \u2014 which I\u2019d heard about from a friend \u2014 seemed out there; I considered one only after my marriage fell apart. That friend connected me to Katia Novikova, a Ukrainian astrologer who lives in Rome.",
      "When Ms. Novikova, a pianist by training, took up astrology in 1995, she immediately began searching for a way to exercise control over the stars. A few years later, she discovered active astrology. Ms. Novikova\u2019s first foray into solar return trips came in 2011, after she did her chart for the year ahead and foresaw her own death. She recalled with a laugh how she used a combination of software and her extensive knowledge of astrology to find a solar return destination \u2014 Barcelona \u2014 where her stars offered a better outcome: \u201cInstead of dying, I changed it for health, for art and for money. It was simple.\u201d",
      "The trip was also easy \u2014 an inexpensive flight from Rome.",
      "Upon returning, Ms. Novikova landed a regular gig as a pianist, and requests for private lessons poured in as well.",
      "So not only did Ms. Novikova continue doing A.S.R.s, she also offered free readings to friends. When word spread and strangers began inquiring about readings, Ms. Novikova started charging.",
      "One of those strangers who found Ms. Novikova is the television writer Safia M. Dirie, who asked not to give her age.",
      "On Ms. Novikova\u2019s advice, Ms. Dirie, who lives in Los Angeles, made her first solar return trip in 2016 to the Cook Islands, a small South Pacific nation, looking to change her luck in love. Less than a year later, she met the man who is now her husband.",
      "The next year, Ms. Novikova sent Ms. Dirie to a tiny town called Swink, population 667, on the southeastern plains of Colorado. Because there were no hotels in Swink and her solar return was taking place in the middle of the night, Ms. Dirie and a friend white-knuckled it from Colorado Springs, a couple of hours away. In the dark, amid a tornado warning, tumbleweeds kept rolling out in front of the car and she kept slamming on the brakes, thinking they were deer.",
      "When Ms. Dirie and her friend arrived in Swink, they found it pitch black, the power knocked out by the storm. They parked in front of a random house until her 2:08 a.m. solar return passed. Then the two \u201cwent over to the next town and got a piece of pie at an all-night diner.\u201d",
      "Ms. Dirie, who likened her own solar return trips to pilgrimages, said that A.S.R.s are \u201cpretty popular\u201d in her Los Angeles circle, but solar return trips aren\u2019t a national travel trend, according to the half-dozen travel advisers I spoke with.",
      "Like a travel adviser, Ms. Novikova tries to understand what motivates a client. After I contacted her via email \u2014 just a month after I\u2019d filed for divorce \u2014 and paid 100 euros, about $110, she had me answer questions about my hopes for the coming year. Then she did her magic and we got on a Whatsapp video chat to discuss the results.",
      "Ms. Novikova started with the chart for my previous birthday. \u201cMiserable,\u201d she said. It was all there \u2014 the rise in expenses, the unwanted move to a cramped apartment, the endless arguments with my husband.",
      "My forecast for 2023 would be best, Ms. Novikova said, if I went to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, at 5:12 a.m. local time on Nov. 13. I Googled the place: Beautiful but remote; the logistics were daunting.",
      "Second: Juneau, Alaska. My stomach turned. Far away. Cold. A dark, foreboding landscape that could swallow me up. There\u2019s the ",
      ", a vast area of wilderness bounded by the cities of Juneau, Anchorage and Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), where many people have gone missing. The state is also surprisingly dangerous, with one of the ",
      " in the country.",
      "No, thanks.",
      "Third place: Brazil. Yes!",
      "Sun, beaches, great food.",
      "But",
      "Ms.",
      "Novikova frowned. \u201cThere are some things I don\u2019t like in this horoscope,\u201d she said. And that was that.",
      "We settled on Juneau, and Ms. Novikova gave me a detailed forecast for the year based on that destination. Not only would I look good physically, I\u2019d have more professional visibility. I\u2019d have luck selling my new book. Ms. Novikova said she saw an editor and a university.",
      "Oh, and love. A dream job, too.",
      "Because it was the off-season in Alaska, I found a round-trip ticket from Palm Beach to Juneau for under $500 and a reasonable rate \u2014 $100 a night \u2014 for a room at the historic ",
      ", which is reportedly haunted. If I\u2019m dabbling in the woo-woo, I figured, I might as well go all out.",
      "Then I looked for a run, a great way to get a workout and a different view of a place from that of most tourists. I was in luck \u2014 the ",
      "\u2019 Veterans Day 8K would take place the day before my solar return.",
      "Arriving in downtown Juneau a few days early, I worked remotely and explored what little was open in the off-season. At the ",
      ", I enjoyed spiced avocado toast, and at the Alaska Native-owned ",
      ", I had a delicious but stomachache-inducing reindeer sausage. I found excellent beer and phenomenal charred carrot hummus at ",
      ". And ",
      " offered spruce tip gin and a smooth, sippable whiskey.",
      "I settled into a routine \u2014 working, running, eating \u2014 and two days in, I didn\u2019t need Google maps anymore.",
      "On the day of the race, I took a bus to a parking lot 10 miles outside town. As a small group of runners gathered, I asked two women if they minded me tagging along. But they were younger, leaner and fitter and they were dressed appropriately \u2014 one had snow grips attached to her shoes \u2014 and I lost the women midway through the run.",
      "Alone in the woods, despairing, I heard someone push through the trees and step onto the trail. Before me was a man I didn\u2019t recognize. He was dressed like a runner, but I didn\u2019t see the yellow bib all the racers wore. He fell into step beside me, explaining that he had stopped to go to the bathroom and decided to wait for me.",
      "Before, I was scared to be out here alone; now, I was frightened by this stranger\u2019s sudden appearance. Trying to push my fear aside, I made small talk. We arrived at a fork in the snowy trail and, because the race was so informal, not all of the course was marked. Both directions were equally covered with slushy footprints and, without anything or anyone to guide us, we puzzled over which way to go.",
      "\u201cRight,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked, worried that he was trying to lead me deeper into the woods.",
      "But separating would have been equally dangerous, so I followed him. And then, suddenly, we were on the shoulder of Glacier Highway, and I was striding toward the finish line as best as I could with numb toes.",
      "\u201cThere they are!\u201d exclaimed the other runners; they cheered us on as the man and I pushed to the end. Not only had they not forgotten about me, they were waiting. A single thought spooled through my head \u2014 I am not alone in this world \u2014 and I choked back tears of gratitude.",
      "That night, at 4 a.m., I woke up \u2014 sans alarm \u2014 just a few minutes ahead of my solar return. Lying there in the dark, I listened for, then heard, the raven\u2019s call, which I\u2019d grown to love while in Juneau. I looked at the phone again, and the time had passed. My solar return was over.",
      "After returning to Florida, I framed and hung the yellow race bib on the wall as a talisman, like the Libyan desert stone I\u2019d bought before the trip, as a reminder of how far I\u2019d traveled and how far I\u2019d come. And three weeks later, just like that, my divorce was final. I had faced my fear of being alone.",
      "Oh, and a couple of months after that, an editor \u2014 from a university press \u2014 made me an offer for my book."

An avid British history buff, she said her interest in the royal family sparked as a teenager watching the 1981 wedding of then Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales.",
      "\u201cHow many times does it happen in one\u2019s lifetime that you get to see a coronation?\u201d said Ms. Higgins Horwitz, 58, who will travel from her home in Skokie, Ill., next week for an organized tour that covers palaces, castles and towers linked to the royal family. \u201cIt\u2019s history in the making.\u201d",
      "Flags and royal emblems are already adorning the streets of London as it prepares to celebrate Britain\u2019s first coronation in 70 years with great pomp and spectacle.",
      "The three-day affair will include a royal procession through central London, a celebrity-studded concert at Windsor Castle, and a national holiday on May 8, as well as street parties across the country.",
      "Areas around Buckingham Palace and the central route known as the Mall are already \u201ccrammed with people,\u201d said Patricia Yates, the chief executive of VisitBritain, the national tourism agency. \u201cThere\u2019s a real interest,\u201d she added.",
      "U.S. travelers \u2014 Britain\u2019s biggest inbound market \u2014 are expected to lead next week\u2019s swell of arrivals. Flight bookings from the United States to Britain are about 10 percent higher in May compared with May 2019, before the pandemic, according to VisitBritain. According to Hopper, the booking app, they are also more expensive \u2014 round-trip airfares from the United States to London over coronation weekend averaged $733 in mid-April, 21 percent higher than a year earlier.",
      "After the coronation dates were announced, searches for Airbnb rentals in London during the coronation weekend ",

Though the company reimbursed her for some of her unexpected costs, Ms. Aveidi said planning the trip was a nightmare. \u201cOne hundred percent we would have changed the dates,\u201d she said.

      "Paul Dabrowa, a biotech company founder who lives in Melbourne, Australia, said that being in London for the coronation is a way for him to honor his own family history. Mr. Dabrowa said his family members were displaced from Poland during World War II and resettled by British law in Australia after the war.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of respect for the monarchy,\u201d he said, adding that he had also attended Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral last September. He has not yet made up his mind about her son, Charles, but will be watching the royal procession on May 6 in central London. \u201cIt\u2019s worth giving him a chance and seeing what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Pranay Manocha, a London-based software engineer, will not be with the crowds cheering.",

Additionally, his grandparents were displaced by the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, a legacy of colonialism: Celebrating an institution that had left lasting pain did not seem right, he said.",

      " that suggest tipping for everything from a sandwich at a grab-and-go counter to an ultrasound \u2014 consumers are often bewildered by when and how much to tip.",
      "\u201cThis is the hottest topic in etiquette right now,\u201d said Daniel Post Senning, the co-author of \u201cEmily Post Etiquette, The Centennial Edition\u201d and the great-great grandson of the etiquette icon ",
      ". He cites the pressure of inflation, the disruption of the pandemic and the rush back to travel for the unease. \u201cThere\u2019s growing anxiety and public discussion around tipping.\u201d",
      "Offering guidance on when and how much to tip when you travel, etiquette experts, academics and travelers weighed in with the following advice.",
      "Tipping standards at restaurants vary widely around the world. In the United States, the American Hotel & Lodging Association suggests in its \u201cGratuity Guide\u201d leaving 15 percent of the total bill or up to 20 percent for extraordinary service.",

      "Despite expert advice, consumers may not have a choice. In many American cities, tips are increasingly included in the bill and often are well above 15 percent. A recent ",

      "At a trendy cocktail bar in Los Angeles recently, an $18 drink came to $24 after an 18 percent gratuity and an additional fee for employee health care.

      " Often, they are less than in the United States and are sometimes included as a service charge (see the section below on tipping abroad).",
      "Some tip requests should be denied, according to experts.",
      "For example, when you\u2019re ordering coffee or a sandwich from a kiosk or counter and are presented with a payment screen including suggested tip amounts, \u201cPush past that awkwardness and push no tip,\u201d Ms. Swann said. \u201cProprietors are offering a perk to employees and they\u2019re putting it on the backs of consumers to absorb.\u201d",
      "Caving in to social pressure or even a scowl from the employee is, in Ms. Swann\u2019s opinion, \u201cgiving in to a level of entitlement that should be nonexistent.\u201d",
      "The growth of credit card payments over cash has made it harder to show a token of appreciation via the tip jar, especially if you\u2019re not carrying cash. If in the past you would pay with cash and leave the coins, Mr. Senning advised rounding up on your credit card and doing the same thing virtually.",
      "Beyond restaurants, travel offers many other opportunities to leave tips for service providers such as cabdrivers, bellhops and valets. Before she takes a trip, Ms. Swann goes to the bank to get cash, especially the $1 and $5 bills that are nearly impossible to withdraw from A.T.M.s.",
      "Most experts agree taxi or rideshare drivers deserve 15 to 20 percent of the fare, depending on the service and the cleanliness of the vehicle. (Ms. Swann once rode in a rideshare car filled with dog hair and made the rare decision not to tip.)",
      "Airport skycaps and the bell people at a hotel should get a few dollars a bag, based on service, and perhaps more if the task is onerous, like handling golf or ski bags. Valet parkers should get $2 to $5 at drop-off and pickup.",
      "And if you only have larger bills, Ms. Swann added, it\u2019s perfectly fine to ask for change back.",
      "Etiquette experts say hotel guests should leave $2 to $5 a night for the housekeeper each morning. The American Hotel & Lodging Association recommends $1 to $5 a night left daily, preferably in a marked envelope making it clear that it is intended for the housekeeper. In its ",
      ", UNITE HERE, the labor union whose members include hotel workers, suggests a minimum of $5 a day and more for suites.",
      "Not many travelers comply.",
      "Despite having the most physically demanding jobs in hotels with few avenues for advancement, \u201chotel housekeepers are some of the least-often tipped employees in the service industry,\u201d according to Dr. Belarmino of U.N.L.V. \u201cUnlike servers, who are often paid less than minimum wage that is then made up by tips, hotel housekeepers\u2019 pay is not contingent upon tips. However, it is a courtesy to tip them.\u201d",
      "But in the age of ",
      " or optional room cleaning, which has become more common since the pandemic, the guidelines get murkier. \u201cIf you stay one night or if you choose to skip housekeeping, I would recommend tipping about $5 at checkout,\u201d Dr. Belarmino said.",
      "If housekeeping is available on demand, most experts recommend tipping each time the room is serviced. And you may want to consider raising the amount.",
      "\u201cIf the hotel won\u2019t do daily housekeeping, make sure to tip extra on the days that you do get service and at checkout, because rooms that have gone days without housekeeping are dirtier and harder for housekeepers to clean,\u201d wrote D. Taylor, the international president of UNITE HERE, in an email.",
      "Customs regarding gratuities vary by country. On some trips abroad, guides with the high-end tour company ",
      " use orientation sessions to advise guests on when to tip in unexpected places \u2014 like bathrooms in Egypt \u2014 and provide travelers with small denominations in the local currency to do so.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a guide to instruct you, make learning the culture of tipping abroad part of your trip planning by consulting guidebooks, tourism board websites and online sources like ",
      ".",
      "\u201cYou have to look at two things: Is it expected and mandatory as it is here in the U.S. for many service jobs? And what is the social safety net like in that place?\u201d said Pauline Frommer, the editorial director of ",
      ", which publishes travel guidebooks covering 48 countries, including advice on how to tip.",
      "In countries like Mexico, where wages are low, she advised tipping in restaurants as you might at home. In Europe, where waiters are paid better, tipping is less important. On trips to London and Paris last summer, she found bills with service fees included, often listed as \u201cS.C.\u201d for \u201cservice charge.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know, you might tip on top of that,\u201d she said, recommending that travelers scrutinize their bills and ask if something is unfamiliar.",
      "In Italy, travelers might find a nominal charge called a \u201ccoperto\u201d on their bill covering bread and water.",
      "\u201cIt comes from the days when you would go to an inn and if you wanted to have a tablecloth and plates, they charged you for it,\u201d said Pam Mercer, the owner of California-based ",
      ", which specializes in small-group travel in Italy and France.",
      "When it comes to restaurant meals in those countries, \u201cThere\u2019s not a hard and fast rule,\u201d Ms. Mercer said. Her company advises guests to tip 5 to 10 percent at restaurants and give the tip directly to the waiter.",
      "In cafes and cabs, she rounds up and leaves the change.",
      "\u201cFrance pays its employees a living wage, unlike the U.S.,\u201d wrote Janice Wang, an American living in France who runs a Facebook group for expatriates there, in an email. \u201cHence, servers, hairdressers and cabdrivers don\u2019t need tips to live. They appreciate them, but don\u2019t need them. And they never expect a tip.\u201d",
      "Guide services come in many varieties \u2014 from a walking tour leader to a mountaineer who helps you navigate a rock face. Travelers might engage their services for a half-day trip, a two-week tour, and everything in between and beyond.",
      "The global tour company ",
      " states on its website that \u201ctipping is never compulsory, but always appreciated,\u201d while also making the point that tips are a big part of a guide\u2019s income, especially in the United States and Southeast Asia. On a multiday small-group trip in the United States, the company suggests tipping $7 to $10 a day.",
      "The tour company ",
      " notes that 10 to 20 percent of the trip cost for its wilderness outings is standard where it operates in Seward, Alaska. The tip for a group ",
      " led by a naturalist beside the Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park that costs $59 a person would therefore be about $6 to $12 a person.",
      ", which offers group trips in Iceland, Ireland, Italy and Britain, recommends tipping tour leaders and bus drivers the equivalent in local currency of roughly $7 to $10 each a day, depending on the location.",
      "But the platform ",
      ", where local residents set prices for their own tours, discourages tips.",
      "\u201cThe guides are in essence entrepreneurs, rather than employees, and we suggest that the best tip a traveler can leave is to return to the site and leave a thoughtful review, which will help that guide to grow their business,\u201d wrote Paul Melhus, the co-founder and chief executive of ToursByLocals, in an email.",
      "Free tours make it trickier to calculate tips, even though guides work solely for gratuities. ",

      " in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.: The skies have been confounding forecasters and frustrating travelers.",
      "And it may only get worse as the climate continues to change. \u201cIntense events are happening more often and outside their seasonal norms,\u201d said Sheri Bachstein, chief executive of ",
      ", part of IBM, which makes weather-forecasting technology.",
      "So, will flights just get bumpier and delays even more common? Not necessarily. New sensors, satellites and data modeling powered by artificial intelligence are giving travelers a fighting chance against more erratic weather.",
      "The travel industry \u201ccares about getting their weather predictions right because weather affects everything,\u201d said Amy McGovern, director of the National Science Foundation\u2019s ",
      " at the University of Oklahoma.",
      "Those better weather predictions rely on a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning, where in essence, a computer program is able to use data to improve itself. In this case, companies create software that uses historical and current weather data to make predictions. The algorithm then compares its predictions with outcomes and adjusts its calculations from there. By doing this over and over, the software makes more and more accurate forecasts.",
      "The amount of data fed into these types of software is enormous. IBM\u2019s modeling system, for example, integrates information from 100 other models. To that, it adds wind, temperature and humidity data from more than 250,000 weather stations on commercial buildings, cellphone towers and private homes around the globe. In addition, it incorporates satellite and radar reports from sources like the National Weather Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration. Some of the world\u2019s most powerful computers then process all this information.",
      "Here\u2019s how all this may improve your future trips:",
      "The skies are getting bumpier. According to ",
      " from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \u201csevere turbulence at typical airplane cruising altitudes could become two to three times more common.\u201d",
      "Knowing where those disturbances are and how to avoid them \u201cis mission-critical for airlines,\u201d Ms. Bachstein said.",
      "Pilots have long radioed their encounters with turbulence to air traffic controllers, giving aircraft coming in behind them a chance to illuminate the seatbelt sign in time for the rough air. Now, a new fleet of satellites could help warn them earlier.",
      ", a weather intelligence company based in Boston, received a $19 million grant from the U.S. Air Force to launch more than 20 weather satellites, beginning with two by the end of this year and scheduled for completion in 2025. The constellation of satellites will provide meteorological reporting over the whole globe, covering some areas that are not currently monitored. The system will report conditions every hour, a vast improvement over the data that is currently available, according to the company.",
      "The new weather information will be used well beyond the travel industry. For their part, though, pilots will have more complete information in the cockpit, said Dan Slagen, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "The turbulence that caused dozens of injuries aboard the Hawaiian Airlines flight last December came from \u201can evolving thunderstorm that didn\u2019t get reported quickly enough,\u201d Dr. McGovern said. That\u2019s the kind of situation that can be seen developing and then avoided when reports come in more frequently, she explained.",
      "The F.A.A. estimates that ",
      ". Heavy precipitation, high winds, low visibility and lightning can all cause a tangle on the tarmac, so airports are finding better ways to track them.",
      ", based in Florida, reports weather data and analyzes it using artificial intelligence to make recommendations. It also installs small hyperlocal weather stations, which sell for about $20,000, a fifth of the price of older-generation systems, said Ed Mansouri, the company\u2019s chief executive.",
      "While airports have always received detailed weather information, WeatherSTEM is among a small set of companies that use artificial intelligence to take that data and turn it into advice. It analyzes reports, for example, from a global lightning monitoring network that shows moment-by-moment electromagnetic activity to provide guidance on when planes should avoid landing and taking off, and when ground crews should seek shelter. The software can also help reduce unnecessary airport closures because its analysis of the lightning\u2019s path is more precise than what airports have had in the past.",
      "The company\u2019s weather stations may include mini-Doppler radar systems, which show precipitation and its movement in greater detail than in standard systems; solar-powered devices that monitor factors like wind speed and direction; and digital video cameras. Tampa International, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International and Orlando International airports, in Florida, are all using the new mini-weather stations.",
      "The lower price will put the equipment within reach of smaller airports and allow them to improve operations during storms, Mr. Mansouri said, and larger airports might install more than one mini-station. Because airports are often spread out over large areas, conditions, especially wind, can vary, he said, making the devices valuable tools.",
      "More precise data and more advanced analysis are helping airlines fly better in cold weather, too. De-icing a plane is expensive, polluting and time-consuming, so when sudden weather changes mean it has to be done twice, that has an impact on the bottom line, the environment and on-time departures.",
      "Working with airlines like JetBlue, Tomorrow.io analyzes weather data to help ground crews use the most efficient chemical de-icing sprays. The system can, for example, recommend how much to dilute the chemicals with water based on how quickly the temperature is changing. The system can also help crews decide if a thicker chemical treatment called anti-icing is needed and to determine the best time to apply the sprays to limit pollution and cost.",
      "At the University of Oklahoma, Dr. McGovern\u2019s team is working on using machine learning to develop software that would provide hailstorm warnings 30 or more minutes in advance, rather than the current 10 to 12 minutes. That could give crews more time to protect planes \u2014 especially important in places like Oklahoma, where she works. \u201cWe get golf balls falling out of the sky, and they can do real damage,\u201d Dr. McGovern said.",
      "More on-time departures and smoother flights are most likely only the beginning. Advances in weather technology, Dr. McGovern said, are \u201csnowballing.\u201d"

      " in Phoenicia and ",
      " in Mount Tremper imported urban cool to the country with their Moroccan poufs, Tivoli radios and linen bedding. When ",
      " debuted in 2016, its loftlike rooms and farm-to-table restaurant cemented Brooklyn\u2019s presence.",
      "But the Catskills\u2019 legacy as a resort destination extends much further back. It was where one of the country\u2019s earliest resorts, \u200cthe ",
      ", made its home in 1824, followed by hundreds of others. A resurgence swept the area from the 1920s through the \u201960s, when it became known as the \u200cborscht \u200cbelt\u200c\u200c, owing to the number of sprawling hotels there that attracted members of New York\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "Now, once again, there\u2019s an influx of new inns. While many are attracting families, others are targeting a younger audience drawn to a contemporary aesthetic that also evokes earlier eras, and curated travel \u201cexperiences.\u201d",
      "Those experiences might involve, in the winter, a \u201csled menu\u201d of five different sled types that you can take to the local hills, as Hotel Lilien in Tannersville offers. In warmer months, visitors at the new Eastwind Oliverea Valley can take guided walks to forage for spruce, then sit at the bar and taste its infusion in a handcrafted cocktail. And there are so many games \u2014 from Scrabble to shuffleboard \u2014 at these new hotels that you\u2019ll want to make sure you don\u2019t\u200c miss out on the epic fly fishing, rock climbing and hiking the Catskills are known for.",
      "\u201cThe Catskills were always great,\u201d said John Flannigan, founder and chief executive of ",
      ", which opened the Wylder Windham in 2022, noting that the Hamptons and Jersey Shore have gotten too pricey and traffic-clogged. The situation, he said, \u201ckind of naturally created a renaissance in the Catskills.\u201d",
      "A renaissance that has excited many and left others wary.",
      "\u201cThere are pressure points,\u201d Lisa Berger, the director of Ulster County Tourism, said, pointing to increasingly crowded trails, inadequate parking and \u201cpeople traipsing through people\u2019s backyards because a stream runs through it.\u201d The influx of visitors has required a new approach in some spots. For instance, reservations are now required to visit ",
      ", a popular lookout point in Minnewaska State Park in the neighboring Shawangunk Mountains.",
      "The new resorts, for their part, often refurbish existing properties, which means a lighter footprint. Here are a half a dozen to explore.",
      "In the 1890s, Dr. Frederick Lilienthal built a summer home in Tannersville, a charming village in Greene County near Hunter Mountain. It went on to be converted to an inn, and by the 1970s, it was a huge party spot \u2014 \u201ca total animal house,\u201d in the words of David Harmatz, one of the founders of Lost Boys Hospitality Group, which bought the property and opened ",
      " in late 2022.",
      "There\u2019s no whiff of frat vibes in the 18-room property now (except maybe the lounge\u2019s pool table and vintage jukebox). The California-based design group Field Theory respected the inn\u2019s original architecture and decorated with items found mostly at auctions and estate sales, drawing from a m\u00e9lange of midcentury, Japanese and West Coast influences. No two rooms are alike. An original octagonal room features a full-size bed, a vintage desk and wood-paneled walls, while a spacious king room has a rattan headboard and a leather chair. The first-floor lounge mixes even more materials for a layered eclecticism and has a bar and plenty of seating that welcomes the hang.",
      "\u201cWe had someone recently call us \u2018the living room of Tannersville,\u2019\u201d Mr. Harmatz said. As the weather warms up, the mingling promises to move outside to the oversize pool and requisite fire pits.",
      "For most of its 143 years, the Thompson House Resort in Windham was run by the same family. When John Flannigan of Wylder Hotels bought it in 2021, he saw its future as much as its past. \u201cThe vision,\u201d he said, \u201cwas to restore it back to what its original look was.\u201d",
      " is home to seven lodges that, together, make up 110 rooms. Wylder cut back trees and shrubbery so the buildings\u2019 restored Victorian architecture could be appreciated. Then, working with the design firm Post Company, transformed the interiors, particularly the main lodge, adding a restaurant, a bakery and a lounge with various pockets for reading, relaxing and, of course, playing games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be fussy or design-y,\u201d Mr. Flannigan said. The rooms \u2014 from \u201ccozy\u201d queens to suites to an entire four-bedroom farmhouse \u2014 feel bright and fresh with crisp navy quilts and wide plank oak floors. Eighty-two rooms also have oversize balconies to bring the outdoors in. And yet the outside keeps calling: \u200cThe grounds, through which the Batavia Kill flows, include a heated swimming pool, pickleball and other lawn games.",
      "It would be tough to find hoteliers who know the region better than the local couple Sims and Kirsten Harlow Foster. Since 2014, they have steadily been introducing inns across a southern pocket of the Catskills.",
      "The newest, ",
      " was born from one of the last remaining 20th-century boardinghouses in Sullivan County that hadn\u2019t been razed: the Armbrust House.",
      "\u201cWe let it be what it wanted to be \u2014 which was an old Victorian hotel,\u201d said Mr. Foster of the property\u2019s grand presence. The main inn has 22 rooms, a couple of parlors, and a bar and restaurant, decorated with vintage Catskills photos and cozy velvet seats and couches. A large front porch and terrace overlooks Lake Kenoza. Last June they added 10 bungalows, a nod to the region\u2019s bungalow colonies from the 1950s. Each has a private porch, oversize tub, gas stove and custom furnishings, such as modern fainting couches and sectional sofas. Even the walk along the wandering paths to reach the bungalows \u2014 which are perched above the main house, near the heated pool, spa and trailheads \u2014 can feel like an escape.",
      "When Rob Blood, the founder of Lark Hotels, was growing up in the \u201980s, he remembers being in the car with his parents, hearing Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and the Band on the radio. This is the vibe he tapped into when considering ",
      "\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe were imagining ourselves sitting around a fire with this playlist in the background, and what are the elements we want surrounding us?\u201d he said. The answer was plaid throws, leather couches and an old turntable with vinyl crackling through a speaker. The kind of space like the lodge\u2019s alpine lounge, tricked out with fishing gear, landscape paintings and local artifacts scavenged from nearby antique stores. Then there\u2019s the tavern, with its cathedral ceiling, stone fireplace and menu with local beers. \u200c All of it was designed by Rob and his wife, Megan Kennedy, as part of Lark\u2019s design studio, Elder & Ash.",
      "The couple\u2019s family \u2014 they have three children \u2014 inspired them to go big on the rooms. Some feature double queen bunk beds, others open up onto the back lawn with mountain views, and adjoining bi-level king-size suites can be combined to accommodate 10 people.",
      "Five years after starting Eastwind Hotels with a 26-room property in Windham, Bjorn Boyer, Julija Stoliarova and Dan Cipriani opened another Catskills resort in January: ",
      ".",
      "While the Windham property took over an old motel, they started from scratch in the new location, building 15 Lushnas \u2014 free-standing Scandinavian-inspired cabins \u2014 in a secluded hollow along the Esopus Creek in Ulster County, along with 12 other guest rooms. A dramatic pitched-roof structure housing a restaurant and bar, named Dandelion, anchors the property. It\u2019s communal space like this that is central to the Eastwind experience.",
      "\u201cWe try to program the space so that guests get to know each other and get to be around each other,\u201d Mr. Boyer said. That means turning over the restaurant to a candle-making workshop in off-hours and offering yoga beneath the building\u2019s eaves.",
      "Aesthetically, the partners are also keen to be welcoming, creating coziness through minimalistic but homey furnishings. The A-frame cabins feature queen beds, vintage lighting and d\u00e9cor, and Turkish carpets. \u201cI was determined to find pieces that stand out, are comfortable and have a story about where they came from,\u201d Ms. Stoliarova said. \u201cThey are one of a kind in my eye.\u201d",
      "While many of the area resorts being renovated date to the 1800s, the roadside Rip Van Winkle Motor Lodge was very much a relic of the 1930s before Ray Pirkle and Kim Bucci of Ramshackle Studio transformed it. Along with Mountain Shore Properties, the duo, also responsible for the ",
      " in Hudson, N.Y., took on the hotel, built and maintained by the same family for eight decades, and simultaneously restored it to its earlier condition and modernized it with custom furniture and amenities.",
      " offers 24 guest rooms in the main lodge and 26 log cabins scattered across 22 acres. Each is uniquely designed and decorated, some with wooden spindle bed frames, others with Shaker-style nook beds; all keep the rustic knotty pine walls.",
      "\u201cOur goal was to infuse modern Shaker elements without scrubbing away the sense of history,\u201d Ms. Bucci said. In the main lodge, which also houses Casa Susanna, a Mexican restaurant, they converted the former dance hall into the lobby, sanding the floors back to their original state and restoring a grand stone fireplace, which is flanked by couches and a library table. Come summer, the property\u2019s Swim Club will open, providing access to the pool, cabanas and an outdoor bar."

      "In virtually every circumstance that comes to mind, a steaming pile of rice is stellar on its own. But to top those grains with ingredients simmered in dashi and soy sauce, before they\u2019re set into a bowl and sprinkled with scallions and shichimi, culminating in delicious donburi, is another plane of pleasure entirely. As straightforward as these Japanese rice bowls may seem \u2014 (perfect) rice! Covered with (perfectly) poached ingredients! Served in a (perfect) bowl! \u2014 their understatedness belie their exquisiteness.",
      "Donburi can vary pretty wildly: The versions you\u2019ll find in the Kansai region can look very different from those in Kyushu, which, in turn, can differ from their cousins in Hokkaido or Kanto. And while there are many possibilities, some all-stars make repeat appearances: simmered beef in gyudon, tempura in tentamadon and raw salmon in hokkaidon. But in practically every iteration, a bowl of rice is topped with a thick layer of deliciousness and served in proportions that vary from the very humble to the deeply extravagant. ",
      "There\u2019s a sort of holiness in donburi\u2019s simplicity, which is endless, permeable and variable. With its smoking eel just slightly grilled and settled over rice, every bowl of unadon I\u2019ve eaten at Kuromon Market in Osaka, tanked in the mornings after cartwheeling with the gays through the city\u2019s Doyama district, has been the closest I\u2019ve found myself to divinity. And no matter how sleepy or hung over or hangry it found me, each bowl of tendon that I\u2019ve scarfed, standing cross-legged in a train station, has been just ethereal enough to carry me to wherever I\u2019m going. Even just watching the glistening bowls of animated katsudon \u2014 fried pork loins, simmered in eggs \u2014 in animated episodes of \u201cYuri!!! on Ice\u201d is cause enough to wonder what I sacrificed in a past life to warrant such decadence in this one.",
      "But while every iteration of donburi is three kinds of magical, oyakodon is what I\u2019ll always return to. The dish name translates to \u201cparent-and-child bowl.\u201d Seasoned chicken is simmered in dashi \u2014 alongside soy sauce, mirin and a dealer\u2019s choice of flavors \u2014 before it\u2019s ladled and guzzled down as the runny yolks meld with your bowl\u2019s filling. While oyakodon\u2019s exact origins remain opaque, one of its earliest recorded mentions may have come in 1884, in an advertisement for a restaurant in Kobe; by other accounts, the centuries-old restaurant Tamahide, in Tokyo, claims responsibility for the dish.",
      "My own forays at cooking it were, at first, failures. I\u2019d overcook the chicken. Or I\u2019d overcook the eggs. The seasoning wasn\u2019t present, or it was entirely too heavy. Or my calibration of liquid to filling wasn\u2019t quite hitting, overtaking the bowl of rice rather than collaborating with it. One of oyakodon\u2019s joys is in how no ingredient calls too much attention to itself \u2014 it just works. And while eating a bowl cooked by storefront vendors, chain-shop chefs, train-stall owners or restaurateurs, all working at the highest levels of precision, certainly has its joys, cooking your own oyakodon constitutes a series of tiny epiphanies: The chicken\u2019s suppleness, the egg\u2019s slickness and the reassuring tug of rice on your teeth make for a meal that\u2019s familiar and undeniably indispensable.",
      "So there are as many ways to prepare oyakodon as there are chefs, and the formula mostly remains the same \u2014 but honestly, it ultimately comes down to feeling. My ideal oyakodon might not look exactly like yours, but both will be delicious. And when you\u2019re cooking this dish, particularly for the first time, it\u2019s helpful to take heed of the recipe, sure \u2014 but also to the sound of each ingredient as it simmers in your pan, and how the smell begins to envelop your kitchen as it nears completion. With every attempt, your preferences may change, and with every alteration you make, oyakodon becomes squarely, and decidedly, yours.",
      "But, worst case, you could always leave it to the experts. I was recently wandering (flailing) through Hankyu Osaka-Umeda Station, in pursuit of a particular croissant shop (lost), and I remember passing the same set of glowing escalators for what seemed like the umpteenth time when I decided that I\u2019d settle for whatever nourishment I could get. A plethora of options stood nearby, but I opted for the closest, a tiny stall with just a few things on the menu, including oyakodon of varying sizes. The first bite tasted so familiar that I hardly thought anything of it. I was nearly halfway through my bowl before I realized that I couldn\u2019t remember the last time that happened: devouring a dish that was so very much itself that I couldn\u2019t be burdened with comparing it to anything else.",
      "I all but melted into my seat. But that wouldn\u2019t have been prudent. A line had formed outside. I packed my things, tucking back toward the station, so that the next person could enjoy this particular state of bliss."

      "Tossing that banana peel out of the car window was wrong, for reasons that you expressed at the time, and for others too. Yes, it will eventually biodegrade (even on asphalt, which isn\u2019t a sterile environment), but not necessarily anytime soon. Bird lovers warn us that pesticide-treated fruit peels can be bad for the critters who eat them. And does nobody remember the discarded peels in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s movie \u201cSpetters\u201d? Things go very badly for the motorcyclist who gets them in the face. You might now be tempted to slam this article on the breakfast table \u2014 or text your husband a link to it \u2014 and say: \u201cSee? The Ethicist agrees with me.\u201d",
      "But this isn\u2019t a story about the proper disposal of banana peels; in this matter, your husband is no longer claiming he\u2019s in the right. Two things seem to be going on. First, he\u2019s evidently sensitive to criticism (maybe especially from you, his spouse, and maybe especially when voiced in front of the kid). His pride has been wounded; he doesn\u2019t want to reward you with the concession you seek. Given this dynamic, the only surprise is that a \u201cfault line\u201d didn\u2019t open up earlier.",
      "Second, though, he\u2019s complaining that you\u2019re making a very big deal out of a minor misdeed. Here your pigheaded polluter has a point: not about your initial response so much as about your fully researched insistence on your rightness. Spouses make mistakes. It\u2019s fine to point them out, fine even to be annoyed when they won\u2019t own up to them. In a functioning relationship, however, you know when to drop it and move on; you don\u2019t insist on a full admission of guilt. Facts matter, but from an ethical perspective, kindness counts too. To the extent that your spouse is feeling beleaguered in this way, slamming down a newspaper, physically or digitally, will just confirm his judgment and raise tensions further.",
      "If you really are finding yourself alienated from your husband, you might want to consider couples counseling. Both your response and his suggest that there may be deeper problems in your relationship. A marriage that\u2019s on solid ground shouldn\u2019t slip on a banana peel.",

      "Perhaps with no clearer motive than F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s observation that \u201cFrance has the only two things toward which we drift as we grow older \u2014 intelligence and good manners,\u201d we packed up our possessions during the last dark days of one December and decided to move to Paris. It was pleasant, I had often been told, for a writer to live somewhere where reading and writing were accorded the highest respect, and it was true that \u2014 in Paris at least \u2014 these were semipublic activities: In every park and cafe, on the Metro and on the benches along the Seine, people were openly engaged in what for me had always been the most private and solitary of occupations. Bookstores still held their ground here among the shopfronts, and the deification of French writers living and dead was evinced everywhere in street names and statues and advertising hoardings for new novels. I listened on the radio to an astronaut reading passages aloud from Marguerite Duras from his space station to his earthbound audience below.",
      "Then, last October, the writer ",
      ", the first Frenchwoman ever to do so. We had been in France for nearly two years, and amid the alternating sensations of regeneration and disarray that this upheaval had inevitably incurred, Annie Ernaux had come to represent for me a troubling point of constancy. During my initial months in Paris, when it seemed for the first time in my life that lying on a sofa reading a book was something I was not only permitted but encouraged to do, I made my way slowly in my clumsy French through one slim text after another: ",
      " ",
      " ",
      " \u201cThe Possession,\u201d \u201cThe Years.\u201d The story they told, rigorously excluding anything that did not directly pertain to it, was that of Annie Duschene (Ernaux\u2019s maiden name), only child of a working-class French couple who ran a humble ",
      " in Yvetot, a small town in Normandy.",
      "By means of scholarly excellence, Annie claws her way out of the mire of her origins to teacher-training college, marries the first man who presents himself, is submerged in a bourgeois purgatory as housewife and mother and slowly breaks her way out of that new prison by writing books \u2014 books that try to stop time by questioning and reconstructing as precisely as they can the events that have brought her to the existence she is now leading. Who is she, and where has she come from? Who were her parents, and why did they live as they did? Why did she act in certain ways as she became free of them, and to what degree is her life the consequence of those actions? Has she ever lived consciously even for one minute, or is this task of writing and reconstruction the effort to apply consciousness to blind fate?",
      "Despite the differences \u2014 of nationality, generation, social class, familial situation \u2014 between my own life and that of Annie Ernaux, I found myself plunged as I read into a more and more profound state of recognition. Yet what I seemed to be recognizing were things that no one generally admits. Ernaux\u2019s honesty had the effect of illuminating a profound and unsuspected lack of freedom in her reader. How, through the simple story of her origins, had she laid her hand so surely on the human tragedy of our ability to make ourselves unfree? The answer perhaps lay in her faith in writing as a sacred and transcendent activity. She believed in writing as some people believe in religion, as a sphere where the self, the soul, is entitled to find refuge.",
      "Who she was as a writer bore only one very specific relationship to who she was as a woman: They inhabited the same body. It was to this body that she was confined, actually and artistically \u2014 to its social and economic destiny, to its gendered limitations, to its geographical and temporal location. What had happened to and in this body, what it in turn had made happen in the years from its birth to the present moment, was the limit and extent of her material.",
      "France being a nation that holds itself in high esteem for its literary culture, the Nobel news caused a feverish outburst of pride, but also some startling paroxysms of venom. How could a woman who wrote only about herself be awarded the literary world\u2019s highest accolade? Madame Ovary, as she was called by one conservative French critic, was the prime example of the erosion of literary art by narratives of self-pity and marginalization. The intelligence \u2014 indeed the sanity \u2014 of the Nobel committee appeared to be questioned. It was explained to me that in France the exposure of unglamorous aspects of female reality \u2014 the complaints of the ",
      ", or housewife \u2014 was widely considered to be distasteful. There was also apparently the matter of jealousy \u2014 of Ernaux\u2019s success, of the youthfulness of her readership and now of this greatest of honors \u2014 among the literary male old guard. Yet it seemed to me that such explanations were, in fact, unnecessary: The aggression was simply the evidence that the nerve of truth had been touched.",
      "From the beginning of her 50-year career, the uncompromising candor of Ernaux\u2019s voice has wielded a formidable power of shock: the lacerating portrait of motherhood and bourgeois family life in \u201cA Frozen Woman\u201d; the masterly, pitiless accounts of her parents\u2019 lives and deaths \u2014 and therefore of poor, provincial France \u2014 in \u201cA Man\u2019s Place\u201d and \u201cA Woman\u2019s Story\u201d; her analysis of the extreme subjection at the core of sexual relationships in \u201cSimple Passion\u201d and \u201cThe Possession.\u201d One after another, her works have alienated or dismayed diverse groups across the social and political spectrum, from cultural patriarchs to feminists. It might seem evident that shock is the signifier of truth and reveals more about the people who feel it than about the artistic objectivity that caused it, but in the case of Annie Ernaux, the usual operation of time in reconciling people to truth did not seem entirely to have occurred.",
      "\u201cThis summer, for the first time, I watched a pornographic film,\u201d she writes at the opening of \u201cSimple Passion.\u201d She continues:",
      "\u201cThe story was incomprehensible; it was impossible to predict any of the actions or movements. The man walked up to the woman. There was a close-up of the woman\u2019s genitals, clearly visible among the shimmerings of the screen, then of the man\u2019s penis, fully erect, sliding into the woman\u2019s vagina. For a long time this coming and going of the two sex organs was shown from several angles. ... No doubt one gets used to such a sight; the first time is shattering. Centuries and centuries, hundreds of generations have gone by and it is only now that one can see this \u2014 a man\u2019s penis and a woman\u2019s vagina coming together \u2014 something one could barely take in without dying has become as easy to watch as a handshake. It occurred to me that writing should also aim for that \u2014 the impression conveyed by sexual intercourse, the feeling of anxiety and awe, a suspension of moral judgment.\u201d",
      " books one after another was like watching an edifice being built in real time, something raised out of the wet ground and constructed brick by brick. The harrowing beauty and brevity of these books and their apparent simplicity disguised somewhat the punishing cost of their honesty. Never had I seen the supposed freedom \u2014 the \u201cnarcissism,\u201d as we now like to call it \u2014 of self-examination so exposed in its brutality. Ernaux grasped the depths of isolation and loss she would need to descend to in order to retrieve the original reality of her being. Her art bears no relation to a privileging of personal experience; on the contrary, it is almost a self-violation. What Annie Ernaux understood was that as a female child of the regional laboring classes, her self was her only authentic possession in this world, and thus the sole basis for the legitimacy of her art.",
      "Lying on the sofa, I became slowly immured in the concrete reality of this edifice and of its facts. The girl Annie grows up in an environment of squalor and industry. She is an only child, an older sister having died of diphtheria at age 6. Her father runs the cafe while her mother manages the shop, the two spaces connected by a corridor that functions as the family\u2019s kitchen. There is no bathroom, just a toilet for customers and family alike out in the yard.",
      "Over time, her reality takes shape around certain foundations, the mother and father most evidently, and the cramped labyrinth of the cafe and shop with its simple living quarters above \u2014 a world without privacy or solitude, a world in which the observer is as exposed as the observed \u2014 but also around her own nascent exceptionality, which soon becomes the subject of her parents\u2019 mingled terror and pride. She begins early on to perform outstandingly at school. It is clear she will go out into the world, but what world is it, and how and to what end will she survive there? Their social conservatism and Catholicism \u2014 immovable features of the provincial working-class landscape in which they live \u2014 leave the subject of her burgeoning femininity and sexuality entirely opaque. Were she a normal girl, she would marry young with her virginity intact. This scholarly future is a vaguely nunlike destiny, whose risks of ruination include the possibility that \u2014 as a clever oddity \u2014 she might never find a husband. Yet her parents, and especially her mother, don\u2019t want her to be like them, economically and socially trapped in a cycle of incessant labor. At school, she quickly becomes aware of her inferiority, but \u201cat home, on her own territory, the grocer\u2019s girl \u2014 as the locals call her \u2014 has all the rights. Helping herself liberally to packets of sweets and boxes of cookies, lying reading in bed until midday during the holidays, never setting the table or cleaning her shoes. She lives and behaves like a queen.\u201d (I have translated this passage, and the others quoted in this article, from the French.) Her mother\u2019s one luxury is reading, a habit Annie acquires from her.",
      "At once cosseted and imprisoned by her parents, burdened with the prospect of her own liberation from everything she knows, the girl tries to contain in herself the violent forces of ignorance and desire, the problem of owing everything to people who can teach her nothing, the growing discomfort of her origins that is matched by the mystery of how one could live differently. Though she doesn\u2019t know it, her isolation \u2014 the only tangible result, in fact, of her exceptionality \u2014 is extreme. This exceptionality is the great subject and problem of Annie Ernaux\u2019s oeuvre, the Other with which she spars in book after book, sometimes taking the form of guilt or shame, in others of a savage and dizzying freedom. The exceptionality strives to normalize itself at every turn by making her conform, often to things that directly clash with and contradict one another. The conforming, sooner or later, results in rebellion: She is trapped and frees herself, creates and destroys and survives, learning over and over by this arduous and often disastrous route the opposing facts of internal and external reality. The exceptionality is not, in fact, that of intellectual or physical or moral attributes. It is the exceptionality of the artist, of the person who lives to tell the tale.",
      "In 1958, at age 18, she is given the opportunity to work for a month as one of a group of monitors at a children\u2019s summer camp in S, a village in the Orne. With this first experience of liberty, the whole unfeasible powder keg of her identity explodes. \u201cThe list of her social ignorances would be interminable,\u201d Ernaux writes of herself in \u201cA Girl\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to use a telephone, has never taken either a shower or a bath. She has no experience of any milieu but her own.\u201d In the middle-class world of the summer camp, she is by turns gauche and outrageous, short on manners, taste, charm and savoir-faire \u2014 she is, in a word, unacceptable. She alienates both her peers and her superiors, acquires a reputation for sexual availability and even lacks the discrimination to recognize what has happened. Yet she knows too that she is, for those people, entirely forgettable.",
      "\u201cI too wanted to forget that girl,\u201d Ernaux writes. \u201cTo forget her truly, meaning to have no desire to write about her. Never again to think that I ought to write about her, her desire, her folly, her idiocy and her pride. ... [Yet] there were always phrases in my journal, allusions to \u2018the girl of S,\u2019 \u2018the girl of 58.\u2019 For 20 years I have listed \u201858\u2019 among my book projects. It is always the missing text. Always delayed. The unquantifiable hole.\u201d",
      "During those weeks at the summer camp, she quietly abandons, without quite realizing it, her academic ambitions. She adjusts her expectations: Instead of going to a prestigious university, she will train to become a primary-school teacher. The weeks of summer camp, which at the time she believed to be the threshold of the future, were in fact a turning point back into the past. She would have to account for every moment of that past, both personally and artistically. What she had been programmed to escape was to become, in a very different form, her destiny.",
      "Sometimes, reading, I would experience the curious illusion that this 82-year-old laureate was not my elder but my junior \u2014 that her voice was speaking from a future in which the possibilities for female utterance were bolder, more serious, more liberal. I was as though chagrined by my own compromised femininity in the light of this more evolved future. How had she managed to be so daring, so candid, so autonomous \u2014 so free?",
      "The answer, perhaps, was shame: What Ernaux seemed to have understood from the start is that shame is the obverse side of truth. She uses it as a map, the existence of shame at different points in her history unfailingly leading her to a concealment of self buried beneath it. Besides, shame has an excellent memory, \u201cmore detailed, more indelible than any other. Memory ... is the special gift of shame.\u201d",
      "It was, perhaps, her shame about her origins that resulted in \u201cA Man\u2019s Place,\u201d the book that first cemented her place in French literary culture. Her voice, so unlike any other, told the story of a France that did not usually presume to express itself. Spare, methodical, relentless, shocking \u2014 \u201cclinical\u201d was the word chosen by the Nobel committee \u2014 the severity of its discipline was matched by its unrepentant liberty. This, then, was the strange fruit of the ",
      " in Yvetot, this voice whose internal stamina was indestructible yet recognized no conventional laws, that was capable of such suffering yet was so good at learning from it, that had escaped the bourgeois conditioning of character and thus was always stronger than the things that confronted it.",
      "arrival in Paris, wanting to improve my French, I was put in touch with a writer who wanted to improve her English, and we began to meet weekly for conversations that switched language at midpoint, like a soccer team changing ends at halftime. The writer was Delphine de Vigan, a novelist around my own age, like me the mother of two grown-up children who is no longer with their father.",
      "At first we were a little shy, a shyness that seemed to spring from our joint practicality. To be taking time in the middle of the afternoon simply to converse was a luxury to which neither of us seemed to feel altogether entitled. We had each been the wage-earners and managers in our households; each of us for years had written in extremis around the interruptions and ",
      "; each of us had the greatest difficulty in considering ourselves to be artists; yet we each, despite or perhaps because of the exigency of our writing conditions, had chosen the hazardous route of self-examination in pursuit of a somehow ineluctable truth, the truth of who we were in the world and why.",
      "Delphine de Vigan\u2019s first novel, \u201cDays Without Hunger,\u201d was an account of her near-death from anorexia as a young woman, but in the novels that followed she moved determinedly away from autobiographical material, so that that first slim and agonized text remained there like an unanswered question. What had driven her \u2014 what drives anyone \u2014 to starve herself to the point of extinction at the very moment of gaining autonomy? This particularly female form of self-attack seemed to delineate something, a corresponding shadow or a silence, lying centrally across the field of self-expression.",
      "I, too, at certain points, had felt at risk of becoming fundamentally separated from my own material, when my biological life as a woman began to generate conditions and experiences that were alien to and inadmissible in the writing of fiction. How was I to approach as a subject something whose power of nullification was so great that it menaced the very act of representation? To write about motherhood for instance \u2014 to bring objective scrutiny and distance to the biological invasion of the self \u2014 seemed to be not only a practical but also an intellectual impossibility. In order to succeed as an artist \u2014 it seemed \u2014 both the inconvenience and thus the reality of femininity had to be scrupulously concealed.",
      "\u201cMy mother was blue, a pale ash-blue, the hands strangely darker than the face, when I found her at her house that January morning,\u201d begins de Vigan\u2019s riveting 2011 memoir, ",
      " \u201cThe hands as though stained with ink, at the folds of the knuckles. She had been dead for several days. I don\u2019t know how many seconds or even minutes it took me to understand this, despite the evidence in front of me \u2014 a long time, awkward and febrile, until a cry escaped my lungs. Even today, more than two years later, it remains for me a mystery: By what mechanism was my brain able to hold itself apart from the sight of my mother\u2019s corpse, and most of all from its smell, how had it taken so much time to accept the information that was in front of it? It was not the only question that her death left me with.\u201d",
      "With this book, de Vigan spectacularly marked the end of her self-annexation, or rather the point at which the internal pressure of truth forced its content out into the world. Her mother\u2019s suicide was a sort of refusal or breakdown of the female narrative. To comprehend it, every aspect of de Vigan\u2019s reality had to be dismantled: the entire carapace of self, of history both personal and impersonal, of memory and fact and myth, of the collective life and the individual reality, and most of all of writing \u2014 narration \u2014 and its relationship to being. The book is not so much a reconstruction of her mother\u2019s life as a gathering of evidence, by which the private and subjective is made public and accountable. It required a painstaking examination of her wider family \u2014 a formidable and traditionally French clan of aunts and uncles and grandparents \u2014 and therefore of family culture itself. The resulting book is an inquiry into the \u201creality\u201d a child is born into, a domain tyrannized by authority structures and social codes in which the personal binds fatally with the authorized and communal to make a theater of blood relationships.",
      "\u201cTo write about one\u2019s family,\u201d de Vigan writes, \u201cis without doubt the surest means of falling out with them.\u201d Throughout her narration, she remains terrified and tormented by her power of disclosure, like a child being handed a dangerous weapon. She reveals, among other things, that her mother claimed to have been raped by her own father as a teenager, an accusation the mother made in writing at 32, sending the text to every member of her family. No one ever mentioned it: Life continued as normal, the family meeting regularly for Sunday lunch at the grandparents\u2019 country house.",
      "Midway through the book, rived with anxiety about the secrets she is revealing, de Vigan recounts a dream in which such a gathering of the long-dead is occurring. \u201cEveryone is there, nothing has changed: the collection of porcelain plates on the wall, the serving baskets placed here and there around the table, the smell of roast lamb drifting in the air.\u201d As the food is being served, a silence suddenly falls, and her dead grandmother turns to her, \u201cwith that sorrowful or disappointed expression that sometimes alters her gaze, without hostility. \u2018It isn\u2019t nice what you\u2019re doing, darling,\u2019 she says. \u2018It isn\u2019t nice.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing Holds Back the Night\u201d was published in France to a wave of recognition, selling a million copies and winning numerous prizes. In this literature-loving country, Delphine de Vigan became a modest sort of rock star, yet the aims of her book were in a sense challenging or undermining the tenets of that culture and the story it told about itself. Among other things, what de Vigan \u2014 and the powerful response of her public \u2014 testified to was the personal cost exacted by life in this exalted, beautiful yet patriarchal nation. Her book is a girl\u2019s story, her own girlhood as well as that of her mother, yet she finds that there is no template for it. Her mother\u2019s pain \u201cwas part of our childhood, and later of our lives as adults,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout doubt her pain formed us, my sister and me. Yet any attempt at explanation is bound to fail. Instead I must make do with a writing made of odds and ends, of fragments, of hypotheses.\u201d",

      " a weekly 90-minute television show about books, had often been cited to me as the emblem of France\u2019s exceptional relationship to literary culture. Once a week, the country sat down to watch a special-effects-free sequence of interviews and debates with the writers of the moment. The prestige and sales figures of these writers were considerably advanced by an appearance on \u201cLa Grande Librairie\u201d \u2014 an invitation was among the most fiercely desired laurels for the contemporary French writer. It was unusual, I had been told, for a foreign or non-French-speaking author to be invited; the need for an interpreter slowed things down too much.",
      "On the phone, I explained that my French was not good enough to accept the invitation. There was silence on the other end \u2014 evidently no one refused such an offer; it simply wasn\u2019t possible. What wasn\u2019t possible, I continued, was that I would speak French on national television when I was still capable of making basic errors ordering a baguette in a ",
      ". It was explained to me that not only would I do so, I would do so very well. A special edition of the program had been put together for Annie Ernaux: The author herself would be there. My appearance would be a nice surprise for her, and besides, they needed someone to give the international perspective.",
      "The near-hysterical national pride one might have anticipated at the Nobel accolade had, it seemed, been accompanied by some self-reproach. There was a general feeling that Annie Ernaux had somehow escaped appreciation, had been denied justice in her own country. Despite the French reverence for literature, it had required non-French eyes to see her true worth. The Anglophone world, for instance, had long understood her importance \u2014 it was seemingly as a witness to this debatable notion that I was invited to participate in the special edition of \u201cLa Grande Librairie.\u201d",
      "I went to ask Delphine de Vigan\u2019s advice, but she, too, seemed to be inhabiting this other reality, in which I could discuss literary matters in French before an audience of a million people. You\u2019ll be fine, she said. She offered to help me practice. Afterward we sat and talked about writing, about the blankness and terror that sometimes overcome each of us at the idea of having to write another book, as though it were some awful duty. Would either of us write again, if we had sufficient means not to? It seemed to me that for each of us it was this binding of writing with practicality \u2014 which for years had lent legitimacy to an apparently impractical activity \u2014 that now darkened the prospect of exercising our craft. I felt sure that neither of us knew any greater joy than that of doing our work, yet the framing of it as a job rather than art had become habitual.",
      "After the startling success of \u201cNothing Holds Back the Night,\u201d Delphine de Vigan wrote a clever, tenebrous faux-memoir called ",
      " in which the splitting of herself, first by writing the book about her mother and then by the extraordinary fame it brought her, is incarnated in a woman she meets at a party who insinuates herself into her life and nearly destroys it. While writing this book, she felt, she says now, the most crippling self-consciousness and anxiety, as though a goblin critic were sitting on her shoulder laughing cruelly at every line she set down. She was certain it was a failure and nearly didn\u2019t publish it at all: It was a huge success and won the prestigious Prix Renaudot, as well as the Prix Goncourt des Lyc\u00e9ens.",
      "This fear of writing, which is not perhaps a fear of failure so much as a deep and half-unconscious belief that writing is socially and morally wrong, seemed to me to be the very reverse of Annie Ernaux\u2019s vocational objectivity. \u201cIt is the absence of a sense of what one is living at the moment one lives it that multiplies the possibilities of writing,\u201d Ernaux writes in \u201cA Girl\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cTo explore the gulf between the frightening reality of what happens, at the moment it happens, and the strange unreality, years later, of what happened.\u201d",
      "On the set of \u201cLa Grande Librairie,\u201d amid the cameras and wires and blinding lights, where an atmosphere of sustained nervous frenzy was running through everything like an electric charge, Annie Ernaux was sitting among the other participants on a plush sofa \u2014 small and still and composed, like a statue depicting sanity. It was before the eyes of this sanity, rather than those of x million French people, that I would consider myself to be judged.",
      "For me, the conversation was like a ball being thrown very fast from one participant to another. I could understand very little of what was being said: My strategy had been to learn by heart a number of all-purpose lines, which I delivered every time the direction of the others\u2019 eyes indicated the ball was being thrown to me. Afterward I was ready to faint. The producer and presenter congratulated me. You see? they said. We told you it would be fine!",
      "There was a small drinks reception for us all downstairs, and I was surprised to see Ernaux, proud and elegant, standing there alone, away from the talking groups. Her solitude and apartness seemed like things she carried with her wherever she went. I approached her and said hello, and she took my hand and patted it. Hers was soft and warm. Her eyes were like searchlights. We stood there, our hands clasped together. I would be very glad, she said after a while, if in a week\u2019s time everyone could forget this had ever happened.",
      "Delphine de Vigan and I drove out to Cergy, where Ernaux lives. It is the suburb she describes in \u201cThe Years,\u201d the 2008 novel that finally carried her reputation outside France. \u201cThe Years\u201d is a longer and more ambitious book than its predecessors: The familiar facts of Ernaux\u2019s life are there, but this time they are integrated into a broader context of social history, political and cultural events, and most of all the advance of capitalism into every aspect of life in the second half of the 20th century. For the first time Ernaux sees herself not as the anomaly from Yvetot but as part of the wave of history, a gendered organism shaped and driven by forces both seen and unseen, forces whose operation around individual consciousness and destiny has been far more powerful and fundamental than the myth of self-will and personality would seem to allow.",
      "The Oise River, seen from the rise behind Ernaux\u2019s house, winds shining through the valley below among groves of bare trees. It is a square, somber house in a large, sloping garden: Its broad and unimpeded view of the river is startling. Along the lanes and cul-de-sacs we passed on the way the houses are closely packed, their territories demarcated with walls and hedges and security gates that block one another\u2019s line of sight and leave no space empty. Ernaux\u2019s ample shaggy lawn and trailing trees giving way to a wide perspective of sky and valley seem the fruits not of privilege but of artistic and moral consistency: She has lived in this house for 40 years, during which time the world has filled in all the space around her.",
      "Standing outside her front door, I was conscious that we were in one of her literary sites, the home that was the stage set for the woman she became, burning with oppression and desire and her indefatigable power of truth. \u201cFrom September last year, I did nothing else but wait for a man,\u201d she writes in \u201cSimple Passion,\u201d the story of her midlife affair with a married Eastern European diplomat. \u201cFor him to call me and come round to my place ... I had no future other than the telephone call fixing our next appointment. I would try to leave the house as little as possible, except for professional reasons . . . forever fearing that he might call in my absence. I would also avoid using the vacuum cleaner or the hair dryer as they would have prevented me from hearing the sound of the telephone. Every time it rang, I was consumed with hope, which usually only lasted the time it took me slowly to pick up the receiver and say hello. When I realized it wasn\u2019t him, I felt so utterly dejected that I began to loathe the person who was on the line.\u201d",
      "Ernaux was widely upbraided by her feminist readers for this portrayal of female dependency on male sexual attention: The clinical spotlight of her regard, so revelatory when it illuminates that which one is willing to see, becomes distinctly uncomfortable when it falls too close to home. Those same readers may later have found themselves forced to salute her for \u201cThe Young Man,\u201d her account of her relationship in her late 50s with a man 30 years her junior. She describes encountering, when out with the young man in public places, \u201cthe looks of heavy disapproval from people around us. Looks which, far from causing me to feel shame, reinforced my determination not to hide my liaison with a man \u2018young enough to be my son,\u2019 when any man in his 50s could be seen with a girl who was evidently not his daughter without arousing the slightest reprobation.\u201d",
      "She answered the door, beaming with welcome. Inside the house was filled with cold, clear light. It was uncluttered and tidy, modestly and tastefully furnished with antiques, yet it was evident that very little had changed here: The small, spare kitchen where she prepared coffee for us was a kitchen from 40 years ago. Yet the house seemed expressive of a double achievement: her rise from the ",
      " and her stoical resistance of the temptation to falsify or adorn the facts that surround her. We sat at the table in the sunny dining room. She talked about the imminent Nobel Prize ceremony, for which she needed to travel to Stockholm. Her main concern was her descent, before the audience, of a long staircase: At 82, she was worried she\u2019d fall over. We asked whether someone couldn\u2019t accompany her down, and she instantly looked startled. Later, I realized that this well-meaning suggestion was rather tactless: Her autonomy, her uncompromising independence from everyone and everything she has met with in life, was the reason she was going to Stockholm in the first place.",
      "When she talked about her age, and the handful of years she imagines are left to her, the luminosity of her countenance was arresting, and I was struck by the sheer aliveness of this creature and by her undimmed force of inquiry. The question, she said, is how to live when life is nearly over. What, in that context, can life mean? A few months earlier, she and her son David made a documentary, \u201cLes Ann\u00e9es Super 8,\u201d that is a collage of the home movies of their family life shot by her then-husband, Philippe, from 1972 to 1981. The images, so indelibly dated, put the past into a long and almost unbearable perspective. Talking now about the film, and about the clarity with which it summons back her past selves as a young wife and mother, she recalled the secret life that the images did not show: her determination, amid the detritus and preoccupations of conventional family life, to record her inner world in writing.",
      "She wrote her first novel, \u201cCleaned Out,\u201d in secret and mailed it to a publisher in Paris, giving only the address of the school where she was teaching at the time. She didn\u2019t even enclose a cover letter. The weeks during which she waited for a response were filled with the weighty sense of what she had done. Talking about it now, all these years later, she even recalled the dates: of the mailing of the parcel, of the stages of the wait \u2014 fevered expectation followed by doubt followed by the beginnings of resignation \u2014 and of the receipt finally of the letter of acceptance. When the news came, she realized that this was not to be a covert contract with the world, of news smuggled out of her domestic entrapment in an envelope \u2014 the people who knew her, most of all her husband and mother, would also read it. She feared her husband\u2019s reaction, sure enough, to this written betrayal of their shared life, but it was, she says now, her mother\u2019s response to the book that was in fact the only one that mattered to her.",
      "Her mother had come to live with them after her father\u2019s death, and she took the book with her into her bedroom and closed the door. Ernaux recalls going to that door several times during the night and seeing the light still burning through the crack. In the morning, her mother came down to breakfast and didn\u2019t say a word about what she had read, a silence that signaled her acceptance of the situation. It is extraordinary that this tough and humble woman, whose existence had been led under the severest constraints of a reality in which the breaking of social codes could have catastrophic consequences, could approve her daughter\u2019s actions in publicly smashing the bourgeois veneer of her family life.",
      "Proud as her mother was, Ernaux says now, of her daughter\u2019s achievement in securing for herself the undreamed-of accouterments of a conventional middle-class existence, she was prouder of her writing. In the past, on discovering them, she had burned Ernaux\u2019s diaries and notebooks, doubtless out of terror at what their content implied for her daughter\u2019s future. But in the official acceptance by a publisher she recognized legitimacy.",
      "In the bright, tranquil silence of Ernaux\u2019s dining room, I was struck by the force and meaning of this story, the power that a mother\u2019s acceptance could bestow on a woman artist, arming her against the whole world. After an hour or so, we took our leave. In the car on the way home, de Vigan and I spoke about the palpable and forceful aura that emanates from Ernaux and her home, an aura of unbreakable and radiant autonomy. It is rare, we agreed, to encounter someone of such strength. De Vigan wondered whether it was her survival over the years of the attacks on her work and persona \u2014 beginning, to my mind, with the dismay of her husband, who, unlike her mother, could not surmount his embarrassment from her manuscript \u2014 that have fortified her. I disagreed: It was, in my opinion, the fruit of love. From the beginning, her parents believed in her fiercely, passionately, as the most important thing in the world. The fact that they were the owners of a provincial corner store makes no difference.",
      "It is something neither of us had, I said, this unbreakable gift of love, the mother-love that extends even to forgiving the betrayal that is writing. Her own mother, de Vigan said, tried her best to be supportive of her work but was very hurt and embarrassed by the portrayal of the mother in \u201cDays Without Hunger.\u201d It is, I surmised, the reason each of us have struggled to contain the splintering of our creative energies around personal truth, this elemental fear of disapproval, rejection, abandonment \u2014 the grandmother\u2019s suggestion that what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t very nice.",
      " that the venom directed toward Annie Ernaux on social media after her Nobel win had become so uncontrolled that it was the subject of an editorial in L\u2019Obs, the French news weekly. When I next saw de Vigan, she was bewildered and upset by such hatred \u2014 where did it come from, and why? She admitted she had been slow to recognize the flourishing problem of misogyny in today\u2019s world \u2014 like me, she belongs to a generation who grew up believing that feminism had somehow already occurred, that the concepts of social justice and equality were as subject to progress as the evolution of science and technology. Yet if it seems that in our time we have discovered new ways of hating, this belief in the illusion of progress may be the cause. Misogyny, the oldest hatred of them all, plays cat and mouse with this illusion from one generation to the next, to the extent that the experience of misogyny, both private and public, could be said almost to have become a subjective state. If it remains difficult for women to make art about their own lives, it is because femininity still has no stable place in culture. Ernaux recognized and weaponized, as it were, the enforced subjectivity of the female voice. Her mechanism of honesty is highly trustworthy \u2014 but honesty, like certain talents, isn\u2019t heritable by the next generation.",
      "In the days that followed, I thought often of Annie Ernaux in Stockholm, descending the staircase alone. Her body, that which has been both her container and her subject, which has been the fragile, mortal basis of her empire, stepping forward into empty space.",

      "On a Saturday night in early March 2021, Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, appeared on live television, seated at a long wooden table and flanked by the country\u2019s prime minister and interior minister. Vucic said he had an important announcement to make about the arrest of an underworld gang responsible for multiple murders. The interior minister warned viewers to move their children away from the TV. A series of images flashed on the screen behind him: a severed head, a headless body, a torso. Vucic spoke slowly, often pausing and staring ponderously at the table in front of him, his 6-foot-6-inch frame hunched slightly. He praised the police and intelligence agents who investigated the gang; they had narrowly escaped being killed themselves, he said.",
      "It was a shocking presentation, even in a country like Serbia, where many adults have painful memories of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and their atrocities. But the news conference was only the beginning of a campaign of gruesome revelations. In the weeks after the arrest in February, new details began leaking into the press. The gang was said to have lured its victims to a \u201chouse of horrors\u201d in a Belgrade suburb, where they were tortured, dismembered, fed through an industrial meat grinder and sometimes dumped in the Danube.",
      "The story captivated Serbs, and not just because of the gory images. The leader of the gang was a burly soccer hooligan and cocaine trafficker named ",
      " nicknamed the Trouble, already a well-known figure in Belgrade. He had been accused previously of murder and a string of other serious crimes, but never did much time in jail. He was rumored to have cozy relations with the Serbian police and intelligence services. He and his men had been photographed in the company of powerful people, including the president\u2019s son, Danilo Vucic.",
      "After the news conference, Belivuk offered his side of the story at a closed-door court hearing. He said his gang had been organized \u201cfor the needs and by the order of Aleksandar Vucic,\u201d according to court transcripts. He described some of the backdoor jobs the gang claimed to have done for the government, like intimidating political rivals and stopping fans from chanting against Vucic at soccer games \u2014 a valuable service in a country where the stadium can make or break a president. Belivuk warned that if Vucic \u201ccontinues his proceedings against me,\u201d he would have much more to say.",
      "Vucic angrily disputed any connection to the killers. But he seemed to take the Belivuk case personally, sometimes suggesting that it was a conspiracy against him. In one bizarre television interview a few months after the arrests, he claimed that Belivuk\u2019s men had made their victims into \u201chuman kebabs\u201d and sent them to Belivuk\u2019s boss, Radoje Zvicer. Looking into the camera and addressing Zvicer, who is still at large, Vucic laid down a challenge. \u201cI invite him to kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no problem with that, because it is better to be turned into mincemeat than to let these bastards rule Serbia.\u201d",
      "As the trial approached, facts began leaking out about the longstanding ties between the gang and various members of Vucic\u2019s administration, who appear to have monitored, assisted and protected it. Belivuk came to seem, at times, like the president\u2019s dark twin, a man who embodies the criminal underside of a state that has grown steadily more autocratic over the past decade. Vucic, who has been president since 2017 and has a lock on the country\u2019s ruling party, has long said that he wants to lead his country \u2014 still among the poorest in Europe \u2014 toward greater prosperity and membership in the European Union. At the same time, he has hollowed out many of Serbia\u2019s democratic institutions, and Mafia-style gangs often appear to operate with impunity.",
      "The Belivuk affair, in other words, is not just a noirish tale about beheadings and cocaine. The gangsterism that has thrived under Vucic, alongside Serbia\u2019s periodic threats to \u201cprotect\u201d ethnic Serbs elsewhere in the region, could eventually unravel the settlement that restored peace to the Balkans in 1995. The Europeans are keenly aware of this, as is Vladimir Putin, who has fresh reasons to divide and distract them. The Kremlin has a long history of supporting Serbian nationalists as beleaguered fellow Slavs and more motive than ever \u2014 thanks to ",
      " \u2014 to ",
      "But the risks for Europe run deeper than that: ",
      " and the spread of illiberal democracy \u2014 already gathering strength in parts of the continent \u2014 poses an equal, perhaps more ominous threat. The Belivuk case has opened a window into a grim possible future, one in which Vucic undermines the European project from within, building a state where democracy is a facade and criminal gangs are used to spread fear. That would be unsettling enough on its own. It also happens to be the same tactic used by the men who tipped the Balkans into a catastrophic war three decades ago.",
      " made his first public courtroom appearance last October, he had already gained a macabre kind of celebrity, his rise and fall chronicled in an endless series of tabloid scoops. He was led into the room in handcuffs, wearing a white polo shirt and jeans. His face was soft and rounded, almost cherubic, with big blank eyes. Despite his size \u2014 he is a big man with a massive upper torso \u2014 he looked oddly like an oversize baby, as if a lifetime of violence had made no impression on him. He and about 30 other defendants, mostly beefy men with tattoos and shaved heads, looked strangely relaxed, grinning and chatting and tossing a few casual insults at one another. Perhaps they expected this trial to end the way most of their previous ones had, with procedural errors, faulty evidence and early release.",
      "After a few formalities, a prosecutor took the stand to read the indictment. When he described how Belivuk and his lieutenant hit a victim \u201cin the neck with an ax and cut off his head,\u201d the man in question yawned and looked at the ceiling. Some of his fellow defendants dozed off.",
      "When Belivuk took the stand, he clutched the lectern with both hands and got straight to the point. His gang, he said, was a state project from the start. He recited some of the services it had provided and even described a meeting he claimed to have had with Vucic at a private house in Belgrade, giving the street address and apartment number and the name of the owner. They only met there once, he added, \u201cbecause, as the boss put it, if someone saw us or filmed us, it wouldn\u2019t be good for him.\u201d",
      "Vucic promptly denied the accusations and even offered to discuss them with investigators and submit to a lie-detector test. Legally, he is not likely to suffer from the trial. No senior officials have been indicted, and very few have even been questioned. The importance of the Belivuk case lies elsewhere. It has forced all of Serbia to face the abundant circumstantial evidence that Vucic has allowed gangsters to become a virtual arm of the state. The support Belivuk and his cronies received from the police and interior ministry over the past decade has been amply documented in court testimony, phone intercepts and photographs. The suggestion that all this might have happened without Vucic\u2019s knowledge elicits laughter in Belgrade. Before Vucic was president, he was prime minister, and a decade ago he reorganized Serbia\u2019s security services. He now exercises near-total control over almost every aspect of public life. From Parliament to the courts to the police to business, Vucic is treated with fawning deference; Serbs cross him at their peril. In fact, the arrest of Belivuk and his gang may be one of the few key decisions of recent years that Vucic did not control.",
      "The bulk of the evidence in the case comes from a team of European police officials who stumbled onto it by accident. They spent two years trying to decrypt a phone messaging app called Sky-ECC, which was a favored tool of ",
      ". When they finally cracked the code, they discovered much more than a local cocaine ring. With at least 70,000 users, Sky turned out to be a virtual Rosetta Stone to the globalized world of organized crime, with graphic messages and photographs flickering across the ether in a dizzying array of languages and dialects. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you were standing outside a house in the dark, and now you\u2019ve gone inside and turned the lights on,\u201d one official from Europol, the law-enforcement arm of the European Union, told me.",
      "Sky was not the first app to be accused by law enforcement of catering to drug lords. But it was the most popular and the most brazen. The company, founded by a Vancouver tech entrepreneur in 2010, boasted that its four-layered encryption was unbreakable; it ultimately made hundreds of millions of dollars before its executives were indicted in 2021.",
      "Much of the Sky evidence turned out to be from the Balkans, and especially Serbia. Passing that data on was \u201cvery sensitive,\u201d I was told by a French interior-ministry official, because of concerns that it might be leaked. Although the Serbian police did ultimately arrest Belivuk and his gang, they appear to have done so reluctantly. Days before his arrest, he and his top lieutenant were allowed to leave the country for neighboring Montenegro, another hub for drug trafficking. Montenegrin authorities said they foiled an attempt to murder them; a Montenegrin prosecutor told local media that \u201ccertain security structures\u201d in Serbia were behind the plot, which may have been conceived to avoid the messiness of a trial.",
      " in power, Serbian soccer hooligans \u2014 and the criminal gangs that overlap with them \u2014 have been enmeshed in the region\u2019s volatile ethnic politics and helped spur Serbian uprisings in other Balkan countries. Some of them profess loyalty to Russia. Some Serbs have joined the paramilitary Wagner group, which has its own history of hiring criminals and has posted Serbian-language recruitment videos for the war in Ukraine. Though Vucic rebuked the group, Serbia remains a kind of fault line between Russia and the West. All this puts Vucic in a position of remarkable power. In a crisis, he could decide whether the Balkan region will settle toward peace or relapse into violence.",
      "The most visible risks today are centered on Kosovo, the country to Serbia\u2019s south that is ethnically Albanian but contains pockets that are majority Serb, especially in the north. Serbia\u2019s leaders remain deeply unhappy about Kosovo\u2019s breakaway from Serbia following the 1990s Yugoslav wars and refuse to recognize its independence, which was established internationally in 2008. The scenario that keeps Western European leaders up at night goes something like this: Vucic, citing a threat to the Serbian minority, sends troops over the border and annexes northern Kosovo. Serbs elsewhere in the region then flee their homes or demand more border changes. This could spell the end of the Dayton Accords, the pact brokered by the U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, which ended the worst of the fighting in 1995 and redrew the map of the former Yugoslavia. It might trigger another war. Even without violence, the collapse of the Dayton order would bolster the politics of ethnic solidarity and autocracy throughout the Balkans.",
      "Another scenario involves Vucic\u2019s concealing his irredentist intentions until after Serbia has been admitted to the E.U. This Trojan horse script has gained credence partly because of Hungary\u2019s illiberal prime minister Viktor Orban, a close ally of Vucic\u2019s who has lobbied zealously for Serbia\u2019s admission. He appears to be hoping that Vucic could help Hungary, a member since 2004, steer the European club in a more populist and less democratic direction.",
      "For all these reasons, the Belivuk case has been a sensitive one for reporters. I was told before I came to Serbia that my calls would be monitored, that I would be followed, possibly even stopped and interrogated. The Serbian journalists who gave me these warnings have themselves been routinely harassed and threatened by both criminals and the B.I.A., the Serbian domestic intelligence agency.",
      "The gray zone between the state and the mafias in Serbia is real. It is also surrounded by outer walls of rumor and paranoia that make a reporter\u2019s job more difficult. I must have spoken to a dozen Serbs whose sons or husbands or children were killed under murky circumstances. Most of them had no idea who the killers were, but they had elaborate stories to tell about corrupt officials, drug barons, arms deals and incriminating photographs. Some had hired private detectives. All of them seemed convinced that the truth was being deliberately kept from them. Yet some of the people I spoke to were clearly hiding things from me. I spent an hour talking to one widow whose husband was among the butchered bodies in the photographs that accompanied the Belivuk gang indictment. She was tall and severe-looking, with long black hair. Her story was poignant, but when I started asking about her husband\u2019s criminal background \u2014 he had done prison time for his role in a notorious gang of Balkan jewel thieves \u2014 her answers turned cold and monosyllabic. I had the feeling that she could have told me a much more interesting story if she hadn\u2019t been worried about the consequences of her husband\u2019s complicity and perhaps of her own.",
      "Vucic is not responsible for this morass of fear and endemic criminality. It is almost part of the scenery in the Balkans, so much so that the region\u2019s very name has been used for centuries by outsiders as a kind of shorthand for ethnic hatred and violence \u2014 \u201ca stage set for exotic thrillers of corruption, quick killing and easy crime,\u201d as the historian Mark Mazower has written. But Vucic has the demagogue\u2019s gift for breathing new life into demeaning stereotypes. He has made brilliant use of Serbia\u2019s mafia problem, creating an environment in which the blurred line between organized crime and the state plays to his advantage.",
      " that both Vucic and Belivuk got their start in soccer fan groups. Perhaps more than anywhere else, soccer stadiums in Serbia are venues for power in its rawest form, a recruiting pool for militias and criminals alike. Stadiums were the crucible of the ethnic nationalism that destroyed Yugoslavia, and those violent emotions shaped Vucic and his contemporaries. Even today, approaching an arena on a game night can feel like walking into a lightning storm. Police officers line the boulevards, and as you get closer, there are teams of militarized police with body armor and shields. Fans sometimes chant slurs that recall those used during the ethnic-cleansing campaigns of the 1990s. Team loyalties take on an almost religious intensity. The chief executive of Red Star Belgrade, the most popular team in Serbia, famously said that Red Star is \u201cnot just a football team, it is an ideology, a philosophy and a national symbol. The Red Star is the guardian of Serbian identity and the Orthodox faith.\u201d",
      "Dead ",
      " alongside plaques, statues and other memorials that bear witness to their status as a kind of vox populi. Hooligans were among the first to go off to war in the early 1990s, and it was hooligans who provided the muscle in the movement to bring down the nationalist strongman Slobodan Milosevic a decade later. Ever since, Serbian politicians have feared the stadium and have tried to keep the hooligans on their side.",
      "Talking to Serbian hooligans is not easy. Some are dangerous. Most of the ones I met were taciturn and wary, no doubt in part because of the Belivuk case. After two weeks of searching, a Serbian colleague helped me find what I was looking for: a man who had grown up alongside Vucic in the stadium, and who was willing and able to talk about their common origins. He was a 46-year-old who still refers to himself as a hooligan, though he has a wife and children and rarely gets into brawls anymore. We met in a bar far from his neighborhood, so he wouldn\u2019t be recognized. He spoke on condition that I not identify him, so I will refer to him as B., his first initial. He has a compact body and a shaved head, and as he walked across the bar his gaze was so direct and fearless that I had a feeling he was charging me. We sat down and ordered beers. He talked fast in English, lapsing occasionally into Serbian when he couldn\u2019t find the right word.",
      "B. told me that the stadium was a rare zone of freedom and anonymity in Yugoslavia\u2019s tightly controlled Communist state. It was also a place where, by the late 1980s, you could see the country disintegrating day by day. Young men began forming gangs and bringing baseball bats to games, aping street gang members in the 1979 American film \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d The older hooligans told B. and his friends to find a similar group of young men supporting the other main Belgrade team, Partizan, and challenge them to fights \u201cto see who is brave and who is not.\u201d This pipeline is still in place, other Belgrade hooligans told me, and sometimes initiates must \u201cbleed\u201d another member to rise up the ranks before being given \u201cmissions.\u201d These may include committing crimes or just beating up a particular rival.",
      "All the young hooligans on the north stand were budding nationalists, B. said, including Vucic. Among the chants was \u201cSerbia, not Yugoslavia.\u201d After a game in 1988, B. said, he and his group heard about a clash between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. They went \u201cto hunt\u201d for Albanians in Belgrade after a game, hoping to smash up some stores and teach the Albanians a lesson. They ended up in a street fight. \u201cPresident Vucic was in that also,\u201d B. said. \u201cAnd I must tell you, I don\u2019t like him now, but he was brave, brave in the fight.\u201d (Vucic\u2019s spokespeople did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)",
      "Vucic has said he was in the stands during a legendary 1990 soccer brawl that has sometimes been described as the true beginning of the Balkan wars. It happened during a match between the Red Star and Dinamo Zagreb teams, and it quickly devolved into a melee that overran the entire stadium. Fans on both sides were clearly primed for a battle: Stones had been stockpiled in the stadium, ready to be thrown. Decades later, Serbian media published blurry photos of the match in which a lanky young man, identified as Vucic, is visible in the crowd.",
      "By 1990, the violence was veering out of control. There were thousands of young vandals looking for trouble, and, B. said, somebody needed \u201cto calm down that group, because Slobodan Milosevic was afraid of them.\u201d",
      "So Milosevic, who was Yugoslavia\u2019s president at the time, selected a leader for the hooligans. This was the first time a political leader entered into such a relationship, and it set a precedent that Vucic would later follow. Milosevic\u2019s man went by the name Arkan. He had a boyish face with a brittle smile that concealed a propensity for violent rages. Something about him commanded respect. Arkan was a storied figure of the Serbian underworld, who made his name with a series of daring bank robberies and prison escapes across Europe in the 1970s and \u201980s. He would go on to become one of the most brutal war criminals of the following decade. Photographs of his paramilitary group, the Tigers, helped turn Western opinion decisively against Serbia. In one of them, a Serbian militiaman can be seen kicking the head of a dying Bosnian woman.",
      "\u201cSo Arkan collects our leaders, he gave them good salary for everybody to be quiet,\u201d B. said. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018Don\u2019t fight with him. We must fight for Serbia now. It\u2019s going to be war.\u2019\u201d",
      "If the soccer stadium shaped Vucic\u2019s character, the war was where he learned politics. Fresh out of law school in 1991, he apprenticed himself to a far-right Serbian politician named Vojislav Seselj. It was in that same year that Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence, triggering the intermittent and brutal conflicts that would shatter Yugoslavia into statelets. Seselj, a proponent of ethnic cleansing, was a useful foil for Milosevic, who could point to him as proof that some Serbs were even more extreme than he was. Seselj\u2019s Radical Party recruited a militia that became notorious for its rampages in Serbia, Bosnia and eastern Croatia, where they robbed, tortured, killed and expelled non-Serbian civilians. Seselj once said his men would use rusty spoons to scoop out the eyes of their enemies, though he later claimed this was black humor. He was ultimately indicted and convicted of crimes against humanity by the United Nation\u2019s war-crimes court in The Hague.",
      "Vucic was an enthusiastic backer of Seselj\u2019s party, and he soon became the youngest member of Serbia\u2019s Parliament. In 1995, days after the massacre of nearly 8,000 Bosnian Muslims around Srebrenica, Vucic gave a speech in which he declared, \u201cIf you bomb us, if you kill one Serb, we will kill a hundred Muslims.\u201d In the decades since then, Vucic has never fully apologized for crimes carried out in Serbia\u2019s name or for his rhetoric. He has treated some convicted war criminals like heroes on their release from prisons abroad.",
      "In 1998, Vucic became information minister under Milosevic, his first position of real power. He presided over a landmark crackdown on the press, levying huge fines on organizations that criticized the government. It was the start of a preoccupation with the media that would help define Vucic\u2019s political career.",
      "But if Milosevic and his deputy succeeded in taming the press, they were losing their hold over the stadium. Many soccer hooligans had fought in the wars, and when they came home, \u201cthey felt they could be arbiters of national identity,\u201d I was told by Ivan Dordevic, an anthropologist at the Institute of Ethnography in Belgrade who wrote his dissertation on soccer and nationalism in the Balkans. B., my hooligan contact, put it a little differently. At the stadium, \u201ca new generation came, and they didn\u2019t give a [expletive]\u201d about Arkan\u2019s riches or his glamorous pop-star wife, Ceca, he said. They decided they had also had enough of Milosevic, who had brought Serbia to economic ruin and pariah status in Europe. At stadiums, soccer fans chanted, \u201cKill yourself, Slobodan!\u201d The hooligans linked up with the political opposition and began serving as informal security during protests.",
      "The big moment came on Oct. 5, 2000, when a week of street protests culminated in the storming of the Serbian Parliament, with hooligans leading the way. Milosevic resigned the following night, and for a brief moment, Serbians were ecstatic. In recognition of the role they played in his overthrow, some hooligans had their criminal records cleared by the victorious Democratic Opposition coalition. \u201cNothing in police, nothing in courts,\u201d B. said. \u201cWe\u2019re free. We\u2019re like angels. Clean slate.\u201d The euphoria soon faded. Serbia\u2019s economy was a wreck, and the European Union was not about to bail out a country widely seen as a den of unrepentant war criminals.",
      "For Vucic, the fall of Milosevic meant a moment of profound uncertainty about his own political future. Years later, he gave a strange interview that hints at his feelings of anger and thwarted ambition. \u201cI was sitting at home and seeing it as a tragedy for the Serbian people,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I went outside, some junkies attacked me, so I had to beat them.\u201d He thrashed them both and knocked them out, he said. But somehow these mysterious assailants got up and came at him again, and he thrashed them a second time. \u201cI went back home,\u201d Vucic said, \u201cand I knew, of course, that Serbia was in for years of collapse and destruction.\u201d",
      " has been shaped by feelings of loss and wounded pride. Serbia came under Ottoman rule not long after a legendary battle in 1389, a date you see spray-painted on walls all over the country. It did not fully regain its independence for almost 500 years. Those feelings were reawakened during the 1990s, when many Serbs believed they were unfairly portrayed as the villains of a complex civil war. They also deeply resented the American-led NATO bombing campaign in 1999 that forced the Serbian military out of Kosovo after it was accused of ethnic cleansing and murder. That expulsion allowed Kosovo, once considered a Serbian heartland, to become independent, another blow for the Serbs.",
      "Vucic and his Radical Party became standard bearers for their country\u2019s accumulated rancor. In 2007, Vucic led a group of protesters in support of Ratko Mladic, the military commander sometimes called the Butcher of the Balkans. A year later, when the Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested, Vucic was back in the streets, getting roughed up by the police.",
      "But the wind was shifting. In 2008, public-opinion research showed that most members of Vucic\u2019s own party wanted Serbia to join the European Union. Vucic helped found a new bloc, the Serbian Progressive Party. Critics derided it as the same old party with a different look. Nonetheless, four years after its founding, Vucic\u2019s coalition won a plurality of seats in Parliament. His party had deftly played to the middle of Serbian politics, promising prosperity, cleaner government and E.U. membership even as it catered to right-wing anger over Kosovo and other perceived wrongs. Vucic was too junior to become prime minister, but he gained control over the party. He was also given authority over all arms of the security services. He replaced the major department heads with loyalists.",
      "Vucic soon began styling himself as a warrior against corruption. He ordered a series of splashy arrests, and the media took to calling him \u201cSerbia\u2019s Eliot Ness.\u201d While some were legitimate targets, more than 100 of those arrested were officials of the Democratic Party that had just been ousted in the elections. Critics deplored the move as political score-settling. But the anti-corruption campaign was popular with the public and especially with the Progressive Party\u2019s membership, which skewed to older and less educated Serbs. The party\u2019s ratings shot up. People wanted something to blame, and Vucic had given it to them.",
      "Among the criminals that Vucic proudly boasted of having put behind bars was Darko Saric, the Balkan region\u2019s most powerful drug lord. Saric, the \u201cKing of Cocaine,\u201d ran a global smuggling network and was indicted in absentia after a yearslong investigation that included the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Vucic, who had just won the 2014 parliamentary election and was set to become the country\u2019s new prime minister, called the arrest a triumph for Serbian law enforcement. Saric, who had returned to Serbia voluntarily and surrendered to the police, had a different perspective. The chief judge in the case told me that he asked Saric in court why he chose to give himself up. Saric, the judge recalled, replied that he felt safer in Serbia under the new Vucic-led government.",
      " by the war in Bosnia, though he was much too young to play any role in it. One morning in the late winter of 1995, when the war was at its height, an explosion tore through the Belivuk family home in Belgrade, killing three. The forensic inspector at the scene that day was a man named Caslav Ristic, already a veteran at his job. When I met him in Belgrade, he was a retiree of 63 with a ruddy face, thinning white hair and a gruff manner. He had brought yellowing newspaper clippings about the explosion, along with his own Polaroid photos from the crime scene.",
      "Belivuk\u2019s father, Ristic told me, was a veteran who brought weapons home from the war; he was keeping two grenades in a kitchen drawer. He had been depressed, and after arguing with his wife, he walked off and triggered both grenades, apparently intending only to kill himself. His wife and mother-in-law were collateral damage. Afterward, the 9-year-old Belivuk \u201chad to go through the hallway, past the dead bodies, to the neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Ristic said. (The only visible injuries he had were some cuts.) Ristic told me it was an unusual case, but only because the father had killed himself with two grenades. \u201cUsually they just used one,\u201d he said.",
      "Belivuk grew up and became a bouncer in Belgrade nightclubs, acquiring a rap sheet full of petty crimes. In the early 2000s, Serbia was struggling with the toxic legacy of Milosevic, who had empowered a criminal class as a means of evading the ",
      " At the top end, mobsters colluded with the country\u2019s intelligence chiefs to protect their cash flow. They were so powerful that in 2003 they killed the country\u2019s reformist prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, who had threatened a crackdown. At the bottom end were thugs like Belivuk, foot soldiers in the rising cocaine trade.",
      "Belivuk might have remained a small-time thug had his life not intersected with the rise of Aleksandar Vucic. Around 2012, as Vucic was gaining control over the country\u2019s security agencies, a new group of hooligans appeared in Belgrade\u2019s Partizan Stadium, and Belivuk was asked to join. Most soccer loyalties are lifelong in Serbia, but the leaders of the new group were mainly made up of people with no prior connection to Partizan. The group\u2019s name, the Janissaries, was a sly acknowledgment of this fact: The Janissaries were an elite Ottoman military force made up mostly of boys taken from their Christian families and molded into ruthless killers for the Ottoman state. Where earlier hooligans had informal and haphazard support from the police, mostly for drug sales, this new group\u2019s ties to the state were direct and political. Its first leader\u2019s name would later appear in the handwritten notes of a law-enforcement official alongside the label \u201cstate project,\u201d in evidence uncovered by Serbian investigative reporters.",
      "Belivuk and his new boss \u2014 a fellow hooligan called Aleksandar Stankovic, known as the Mute \u2014 soon began working closely with their patrons in the interior ministry. The relationship was exposed in a series of photographs and text exchanges that surfaced in a lawsuit years later. In one of the exchanges, Belivuk stressed his fealty, and an interior ministry official texted him back: \u201cShe knows. The boss knows. The big boss knows.\u201d The texts don\u2019t detail who he was talking about, but the minister\u2019s immediate superior was a woman. Vucic was then the prime minister and security chief.",
      "Belivuk would later claim in court that the Janissaries helped pull off a brazen demolition in downtown Belgrade that made way for a waterfront project that one of Vucic\u2019s allies brokered with the leader of the United Arab Emirates. That case, in which dozens of masked men used bulldozers to destroy a street full of buildings that were in the way of the project, remains unsolved.",
      "Curiously, the Janissaries also appear to have helped ensure the safety of gay-pride parades for Vucic. It was a little out of character for the hooligans, a flamboyantly homophobic crowd who had turned the occasion into a bloody melee in years past. But Vucic apparently felt that the violence was becoming an obstacle for Serbia\u2019s application to join the E.U. According to B., who was not himself present, Vucic organized a closed-door meeting with a group of hooligan leaders, holding up a thick packet of case files and promising them that any prior criminal charges against them would be suspended if they kept the peace during gay-pride events. The parades went smoothly after that.",
      "I wasn\u2019t able to confirm that Vucic ever held such a meeting. (Vucic rarely gives foreign-media interviews, and his spokespeople did not respond to my requests for one.) But Stankovic \u2014 Belivuk\u2019s boss \u2014 does appear to have had his cases suspended. When he became leader of the gang, he had already been sentenced to five years in prison for drug trafficking and illegal weapons possession. In the following years, the sentence was deferred a dozen times on phony medical claims, using doctors\u2019 forms that later turned out to be falsified, according to documents unearthed by Vreme, a Belgrade weekly.",
      "Soon afterward, Vucic was asked during an interview if he planned to do something about the rise in hooligan violence. He replied that he lacked the power to do so, because there was no \u201cgeneral social consensus\u201d on the issue. It was quintessential Vucic: part dog-whistle, part provocation and soon forgotten amid Serbia\u2019s constant swirl of real and manufactured crises.",
      " Vucic steadily reshaped Serbia into an autocracy. In 2019, the nonprofit Freedom House downgraded Serbia in its annual assessment of democracies from free to partly free, citing the politicization of the judiciary and other institutions and elections fraught with bullying and bribes. Yet Serbia\u2019s application to join the E.U. has rolled blithely along, as if the bureaucrats in Brussels haven\u2019t noticed that Vucic is moving in the wrong direction.",
      "One important lever of power for Vucic is the media. He has used the state telecommunications company to buy up local TV stations, and his allies run a triad of media organizations that shamelessly follow the Progressive Party line and give plentiful airtime to Vucic himself. These include a TV network called Pink that specializes in glitzy talk shows and reality TV. But the most shameless is Informer, a scandal sheet that features hatchet jobs and images of buxom women.",
      "In early 2017, Vucic announced that he would run for president. The campaign that followed was rife with accusations of voter intimidation, with some ",
      " according to a report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Media coverage was dominated by the party\u2019s organs, which smeared Vucic\u2019s rivals. He received 120 times the coverage of the two leading opposition candidates combined, according to Birodi, an independent research group.",
      "Vucic won the presidency by a sizable margin. With his party dominating Parliament, he now controlled every branch of government and was able to pick his successor as prime minister, a move that earned comparisons to Putin, who in 2008 placed Dmitri Medvedev in the president\u2019s chair to provide a mirage of democratic order in Russia. During Vucic\u2019s inauguration ceremony, hooligans, including a member of the Janissaries, helped to rough up and remove protesters. Vucic\u2019s governing style was becoming more openly authoritarian, with sycophantic public displays of loyalty by his allies.",
      "At the same time, Vucic grew more open in his courtship of the authoritarian leaders of Russia, Hungary and China. Despite all these signs of slippage, European leaders continued to greet him warmly, doling out investments and giving no indication that Serbia\u2019s E.U. application was in any danger. (In 2020, the E.U. donated about 300 million euros to Serbia and accounted for 62 percent of Serbia\u2019s trade.) The reason was no secret: Kosovo\u2019s status is still unresolved. The Europeans were pinning their hopes on Vucic to oversee a settlement. \u201cHe is very powerful, someone who can deliver on things if he wants to,\u201d one German diplomat told me. \u201cHe could be the one to deliver substantial progress on Kosovo.\u201d",
      "Vucic sent reassuring signals to the Europeans, but he had other messages for his conservative base and for the Serbian nationalists he supports in Bosnia, Kosovo and Montenegro. (He shares this defiant language with Putin, who has repeatedly affirmed his opposition to Kosovo\u2019s independence.) These messages are often delivered by Aleksandar Vulin, the interior minister, who regularly complains that ethnic Serbs in other Balkan countries are being mistreated. Vulin and other nationalists drop hints that their true goal is a Greater Serbia \u2014 the same dream that helped lead the Balkans into war in 1991.",
      "The gangs have their role to play in these political charades. Northern Kosovo, with its mostly Serb population, is nominally under the control of the national government in Pristina. In reality, it is dominated by organized crime groups that are widely seen as allies of Vucic\u2019s party and have been accused by the U.S. Treasury Department of conspiring with Serbian security officials in smuggling rackets. That gives Vucic an important lever to dial regional tensions up or down. But as tools of state, mobsters can be unreliable.",
      "The first sign of real trouble in the Vucic administration\u2019s relationship with the hooligans came on the night of Oct. 13, 2016. Belivuk had just left his Belgrade gym alongside his boss, Stankovic, when a team of assassins sped past in a black Audi and opened fire with Kalashnikovs. As Belivuk cowered behind a car, the gunmen sped away, leaving Stankovic dead. The crime scene was soon swarming with police, according to a meticulously documented story published last fall in Vreme. One of the officers, on the phone with his boss, shouted, \u201cWho\u2019s Belivuk?\u201d When Belivuk responded, the officer said, apparently referring to his superior, \u201cShe told you to go back to the hide-out.\u201d The gang had a new leader.",
      "The murder may have been related to Stankovic\u2019s role as a \u201cstate project.\u201d According to the Vreme report, Stankovic, who had been driving around in an armored Audi outfitted with a police radio, was receiving cocaine shipments at lower prices than other gangsters, and they were angry. But the broader lesson of the Stankovic murder was that the Belivuk gang had become embroiled in an increasingly violent war among the region\u2019s drug clans. The cocaine trade was more profitable than ever, with Latin American cartels turning their eyes to the growing European market. Although much of Europe\u2019s cocaine arrives via container ports in Northern Europe, the Balkan route was becoming more important, and much of it was focused on Montenegro, Serbia\u2019s southern neighbor. Montenegro is tiny \u2014 the population is just over 600,000 \u2014 but it has certain features that make it well suited to the trade, including a long Adriatic coastline. Like Sicily, it is poor and dominated by clans with a reputation for lawlessness. And it has a history of smuggling, a practice abetted by the government during the civil wars of the 1990s.",
      "The gang war started after the fall of Darko Saric, the drug lord whose arrest Vucic announced with such ceremony in 2014. Saric had built a narcotics base in Kotor, a gorgeous medieval port town on the Montenegrin coast that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. A group of Kotor traffickers inherited his mantle and then split into rival clans over a 200-kilogram shipment of cocaine. The war quickly turned deadly, with tit-for-tat assassinations taking place in Serbia and Montenegro. The warring clans, Kavac and Skaljar, had built ties to police and intelligence agencies across the Balkans, which were being drawn into the violence.",
      "Stankovic\u2019s murder was seen in Belgrade as a sign that the war of the clans was getting out of hand. On the morning after Stankovic\u2019s death, the Serbian interior minister at the time, Nebojsa Stefanovic, held a news conference to announce that enough was enough: It was time to crack down on the mafia. As it happened, things were about to get much worse.",
      " as boss was to change his gang\u2019s name to the Principi. In an interview with a Belgrade weekly \u2014 the only one he is known to have given \u2014 he said it was because he acted \u201cfrom principles.\u201d He did not say what those principles were. The name carried another tacit association: Gavrilo Princip, the Bosnian Serb nationalist who set off the First World War by killing Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 and who is still widely considered a hero among Serbs for his brave stand against the Austro-Hungarian empire.",
      "Belivuk made bigger headlines a few months later, when he and his top lieutenant, Marko Milikjovic, known as the Butcher, were accused of gunning down a man in central Belgrade. The victim was a martial-arts expert who worked security at a Belgrade nightclub on one of the riverfront rafts. On his favorite outlet, Pink TV, President Vucic explained that this man was targeted \u201cbecause he prevented some of Belivuk\u2019s and Milikjovic\u2019s people from taking over the rafts. When you come to the bunker at the stadium, you get a gram of drugs for 50 euros, and then it spreads throughout Serbia, they sell it on the raft for 70. That price only goes up. And that\u2019s why this man was killed.\u201d Hearing that, Belivuk might easily have imagined that his state support had dried up. Instead, a familiar pattern reasserted itself. The DNA evidence implicating Belivuk mysteriously disappeared, and he and his deputy were both acquitted (though they did serve some jail time before the verdict).",
      "Another sign of Belivuk\u2019s untouchability was the appearance of a guest in the soccer stands: Danilo Vucic, the president\u2019s oldest son. Photographs of Danilo with his arms around members of the Belivuk gang appeared in Belgrade\u2019s independent media, prompting the president to lash out in fury and accuse reporters of unfairly targeting his family. Vucic has repeatedly said that his son, who works in a wine shop, is a private citizen with no official position. But Danilo appears to play an ambiguously political role. Two years ago, he publicly welcomed a Serbian war criminal after he had served his time in Croatia, and, according to Serbian media reports, handed him $30,000 in cash, along with the keys to a Belgrade apartment and a car. The origin of this largess has not been explained. (Vucic\u2019s spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.) Danilo has also been photographed standing with the leader of the People\u2019s Patrol, a far-right nationalist group that stages anti-immigration protests and recently threatened to cross the border in defense of ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo.",
      "By 2019, Belivuk and his gang had established a bunker inside Partizan stadium where they tortured victims and stored drugs and weapons. They had bigger things on their minds than soccer: The war between the two Montenegrin cocaine factions was upending organized crime across the region. \u201cMost significant organized criminal groups have decided to join one of these two rival criminal groups,\u201d was the conclusion of a Serbian intelligence document, cited in an investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an international consortium, in May 2020.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just criminals driving the clan war. Some Serbian and Montenegrin police and intelligence agencies had sided with the Kavac clan, according to the information from the reporting project. (The police in both countries deny any connection with the gangs.) The assassinations started in the streets of Belgrade and Podgorica but soon spread to Spain, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Greece. Several Balkan reporters who have monitored the clan war told me that the current body count is more than 70.",
      "The Belivuk gang was becoming more visible beyond Serbia\u2019s borders. In 2019, the Spanish Coast Guard seized 800 kilograms of cocaine on a ship coming from South America. The drugs were worth 50 million euros. Although there is no evidence that the three Serbian sailors on the boat were directly linked to the Belivuk gang, many of the cocaine packages bore the image of Gavrilo Princip, the gang\u2019s signature.",
      "There is little doubt that Belivuk and his gang are in prison because Europol cracked the code on Sky-ECC, exposing the group\u2019s incriminating texts and photographs. What remains unclear is what the Serbian authorities knew and what they intended to do about it. The Europol officials I met with in The Hague were cagey about how and when they communicated with Serbia regarding the Sky data. Officially, the intercepts were handed over after Belivuk\u2019s arrest, and those intercepts formed the basis of the indictment. But Europol (or one of its partners) appears to have tipped off the Serbs several months earlier. Serbia\u2019s former interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic, said as much, asserting that the arrest was made possible by Sky intercepts. And in October 2020 Vucic, during a rambling statement about gang violence, said he had been hearing about gruesome crimes for weeks, then added cryptically, \u201cAnd don\u2019t let the whole town tell us about how someone cut someone\u2019s head off via Skype.\u201d",
      "That comment got the attention of Stevan Dojcinovic, one of Serbia\u2019s foremost investigative reporters. Dojcinovic is a founder of the Crime and Corruption Reporting Network and has been writing about the Belivuk gang and its ties to the state since 2016. He has been the target of many threats and attacks in the Vucic-allied media, which have labeled him, among other things, a terrorist, a spy, a mobster, a drug addict, a traitor and a sadomasochist. Dojcinovic is a small man with a sensitive, foxlike face and a nose ring. He and his staff work out of a Belgrade office so tiny and full of documents that walking into it is like entering an overstuffed closet. Dojcinovic told me that he believes Vucic\u2019s comment about beheadings (he apparently confused Sky with Skype) may have been a final warning to the gang. \u201cThe Belivuk gang had been useful to the state, but they were getting out of control, getting too violent,\u201d Dojcinovic said. \u201cAlso they were being watched from outside, the Europeans had informed the Serbian police about the Sky intercepts.\u201d",
      "If Dojcinovic is right, the Serbian authorities had not decided what to do about Belivuk and his gang as late as October 2020. They were definitely concerned, because court documents show that the Serbian police started surveilling the gang in early August, six months before the arrests. But it seems they were not concerned enough to stop the gang from torturing and killing people.",
      "Thanks to the Sky-ECC messages uncovered by Europol, we now have an appallingly precise record of what happened to some of the men who started disappearing in Belgrade in 2019. The Belivuk gang developed a murder routine and refined it, with dozens of henchmen playing different roles. Sometimes they tempted the victim with drug or gun deals; in one case they tricked a rival into believing an associate had captured Belivuk and he could now kill him. The Sky text messages often provide a minute-by-minute trail of the crimes.",
      "One of the men they targeted was a 33-year-old rival hooligan leader named Goran Velickovic. He was a prominent, well-liked figure at Partizan Stadium. He was married to his childhood sweetheart and had two small children and a job with his cousin fixing windows. In photographs, he has ruddy cheeks, cheerful brown eyes and a massive chest, with a tattoo visible on his thickly muscled right forearm that says \u201cThe Young Boys,\u201d the name of his fan group.",
      "Velickovic knew all about the stadium and its rivalries. What troubled him, his widow, Jelena, told me, was the role the police played. \u201cThe thing that really worried us, there were police who were there to provide assistance to rival groups,\u201d Jelena said. \u201cIf you\u2019re part of such a group, it gives you unimaginable power. And if you\u2019re against that group, you cannot protect yourself.\u201d",
      "In early August 2020, Goran went out to meet a friend and never came back. It would be months before Jelena knew for certain what happened. Only when she saw the Sky evidence from the indictment did she understand: Goran had been lured out of Belgrade by a man he trusted to a dirt road alongside a deserted wheat field. The Belivuk gang ambushed him, tied him up and drove him to their slaughterhouse, even as Jelena was feeding the babies and making dinner for her husband.",
      "The gang had prepared a torture chamber in a hidden room accessed via the garage. There were handcuffs and straps, along with blades, hot irons and disposable work clothes. The meat grinder stood at one end. Before every murder, gang members laid out fresh plastic sheeting on the floor and walls.",
      "According to the indictment, they brought Goran inside the room and interrogated him, forcing him to unlock his phone and go through his contacts. They pulled off his fingernails with pliers, beat him, and finished him off by beheading him with an ax. They carved an insult onto Goran\u2019s back with a knife, took some photographs and sent them to contacts on his phone. One photo went with a text: \u201cSee honey? Mexico in the middle of Belgrade.\u201d",
      "The gang\u2019s leaders, the Sky intercepts reveal, often reveled in torture. During another murder a few weeks later, Belivuk and his right-hand man called in on their Sky phones from Montenegro (where they were carrying out three other killings) to encourage their henchmen in Belgrade to give \u201c102 percent of yourself\u201d to the torture of the latest victim. The Sky transcripts show that they asked the phone to be put close to the victim so that they could curse him and tell him they were planning to kill his father and brother and \u201ceverything you\u2019ve ever known and loved.\u201d Later, Belivuk texted again, asking one of his subordinates to describe the torture at length and \u201cdon\u2019t skip those juicy details for me.\u201d",
      "After each victim was dead, the men followed the same ritual. They used axes and knives to cut the body into small chunks, then fed them through the meat grinder, gathering the remains in bags which they upended into the Danube. They burned the bags, along with all the victim\u2019s clothes and belongings. They also destroyed the bloodied plastic sheeting and cleaned the meat grinder with acid and bleach. But that was not the end of it. In almost every case, prosecutors say, they texted the victim\u2019s family members, often pretending to be him, and found ways to extract money, drugs and cars.",
      "Jelena Velickovic told me that until the day she found out what happened to her husband \u2014 by seeing photographs of his mangled body on a Serbian TV show \u2014 she found it hard to believe that Belivuk was responsible.",
      "\u201cHe was almost a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cI met him lots of times at the stadium. My husband, too.\u201d Years earlier, when she took her first child to the stadium for a game, it was Belivuk who congratulated her. And, in keeping with Serbian custom, he even gave her money for the baby, a gift of 50 euros. \u201cHe was nice at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI could never imagine that a guy who gave us gifts for our child, that this guy could kill my husband.\u201d",
      "Jelena is a small woman with large, dark eyes, round features and a look of resigned melancholy. Tattoos cover her arms, including a recent one that says in Serbian, \u201cThe pain I feel today will be my power tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Jelena\u2019s lawyer, sitting with us, told me she believed Belivuk and his men weren\u2019t born monsters. It took the government to make that happen. \u201cBelivuk was a victim of unrealistic expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had illusions of grandeur. He and his friends became victims themselves. Someone fed them delusions.\u201d",
      "In the two years since the Belivuk gang was arrested, Vucic has repeatedly said the case marked a decisive break with the past. \u201cWe will clean the state institutions of all their collaborators,\u201d he declared at the first news conference after the arrests. He later told a group of journalists: \u201cThis is important for us, but also for ordinary citizens. Restaurant and bar owners will not have to worry about someone coming and wanting to racketeer them and then they are afraid to report it to the police because they don\u2019t know if someone in the police is well connected to these killers.\u201d It was a message calculated to appeal to Serbs who were troubled by what they heard about the Belivuk case. It may also have been aimed at the European Union, which will not admit Serbia to the club until it gets more serious about the rule of law.",
      "There were a number of reasons to doubt the president\u2019s promise. He has said similar things in the past, and Belivuk is widely viewed in Serbia as the latest in a long series of useful thugs, as replaceable as Aleksandar Stankovic before him. The bigger reason is that the Serbian authorities continue to be cozy with drug dealers and gangs. One of the more sensational recent examples was the discovery of a sprawling marijuana farm 30 miles outside Belgrade that, according to prosecutors, was being protected by police and military officers. The farm, designed to produce highly concentrated forms of cannabis, appears to have been Europe\u2019s largest.",
      "And Vucic\u2019s relationship with outlaws goes beyond Serbia. In 2018, a Kosovo businessman who is accused by the U.S. TreasuryDepartment of large-scale drug and weapons trafficking was charged in the murder of a politician there. Vucic defended him, calling him \u201ca man who defends the Serbian people and the hearths of northern Kosovo.\u201d Paradoxically, Vucic\u2019s influence in northern Kosovo is part of the reason the European Union sees him as a valuable partner. He demonstrated that power late last year during a border crisis that briefly threatened to tip into open conflict.",
      "The confrontation heated up, perhaps not coincidentally, during a European Union summit meeting in December at which Vucic reaffirmed his refusal to participate in the E.U.\u2019s sanctions on Russia. Ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo barricaded the roads, blocking the movements of the Kosovan authorities. Protesters gathered on the Serbian side of the border, including members of the People\u2019s Patrol, the Serbian nationalist organization that has documented ties to Russia\u2019s paramilitary Wagner group. Belgrade sent its own troops to the border, threatening to step in and defend the Serbs of Kosovo. Vucic then held a meeting with a group of Kosovan Serbs, and the crisis came to an end. Needless to say, the border fracas got the attention of the European Union. In mid-March, the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo tentatively agreed to an E.U.-sponsored plan to normalize relations, but Vucic has refused to commit to anything in writing.",
      "Almost a decade ago, an American scholar and analyst named Daniel Serwer helped to arrange Vucic\u2019s first public appearance in Washington, D.C. Serwer worked in the Balkans in the 1990s and he knew all about Vucic\u2019s nationalist roots. But he was disappointed with the record of other Serbian political leaders. He told me Vucic made no promises about Kosovo, but said he would move closer to the European Union. Serwer found Vucic intelligent and serious. There was some hope, he told me, that Vucic could be a \u201cNixon in China\u201d figure, capable of bringing his party\u2019s conservative base to a fuller reconciliation with Serbia\u2019s neighbors.",
      "Serwer told me that his attitude toward Vucic has changed radically. \u201cVucic is now deadly serious about the \u2018Serbian world,\u2019\u201d he said. Those words, invoked often by Serbian nationalists, convey the idea that Serbia is entitled to dominate the lands where ethnic Serbs live, including several neighboring countries. \u201cHe had the opportunity to move in a pro-E.U. direction, and he chose not to.\u201d Serwer speculated that Vucic has concluded the reforms required to join the E.U. would weaken his hold on power or perhaps even land him in jail. That is what happened to the former prime minister of Croatia, Ivo Sanader, who presided over most of his country\u2019s preparations for accession only to be arrested and imprisoned on corruption charges (he remains in prison today). Sanader\u2019s fate has become a cautionary tale for Balkan would-be reformers.",
      "The United States and the E.U. have continued to cater to Vucic, focusing their policies on economic growth and mostly ignoring his illiberalism. The Trump administration seemed especially favorable to Vucic, openly siding with him in a regional tariff dispute and forcing the collapse of a popular government in Kosovo. Trump sent an abrasive special envoy to the region, Richard Grenell, who seemed bent on brokering a Serbia-Kosovo \u201cdeal of the century\u201d to enhance Trump\u2019s prospects in the 2020 presidential election. (It did not happen.)",
      "Serwer and a number of other Balkan experts say that the United States and the European Union are missing an opportunity to push Vucic in a more democratic direction. \u201cWe have more leverage in the western Balkans than anywhere on earth,\u201d I was told by Kurt Bassuener, a scholar who has written extensively on the Balkans. \u201cAnd yet we\u2019re building our policy on Vucic and people like him.\u201d If Vucic knew he risked losing much of his Western financial and diplomatic support, Bassuener said, his calculus might change about all kinds of things, including his habit of coddling criminals and hooligans. The notion that Serbia can \u201cbalance\u201d the West against Russia is largely a mirage, Bassuener said. Russia may be Serbia\u2019s traditional ally, but Putin, who is struggling to rebuild his own shattered army, has little of substance to offer ordinary Serbs.",
      "One afternoon in Belgrade, I spent an hour talking to Boris Tadic, who served as Serbia\u2019s president from 2004 until 2012, when he lost to Vucic\u2019s party. He told me that organized crime has become so powerful in Serbia that it is difficult to know who is calling the shots. During his own time in office, he said, he was amazed to discover that the criminal gangs \u201chad better equipment and technology than our police.\u201d The cocaine cartels had become so lucrative that they could corrupt anyone. Tadic said he had fought the mafia with some success. Vucic, he said, had \u201chelped put criminals in power\u201d with the belief that he could control them. It was a dangerous gamble.",
      "\u201cWhat is the final outcome of your power if you\u2019re going to destroy the foundations of society with hooligans and criminals?\u201d he asked. Tadic glanced uneasily around us at the hotel courtyard. \u201cWho is running this country?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaybe some companions of Belivuk are sitting next to us.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Worth is a contributing writer for the magazine and former chief of The Times\u2019s Beirut bureau whose book on the 2011 Arab Uprisings, \u201cA Rage for Order,\u201d won the 2017 Lionel Gelber prize."

      "Once upon a time, the legend goes, Theseus slew the Minotaur and sailed triumphantly home to Athens on a wooden ship. The vessel was preserved by Athenian citizens, who continually replaced its rotting planks with strong, fresh timber so a pilgrimage to Delos could be made each year in their hero\u2019s name. Fascinated by this mythical tale, the philosopher Plutarch found it to embody a \u201clogical question of things that grow\u201d: After Theseus\u2019s ship had been stripped of all its original material, could it still be considered the same ship? His question has caromed through centuries of Western thought. What if, Thomas Hobbes wondered, someone rustled up a second boat out of the discarded planks; would you now have two original vessels? And what about our own era of machine-made duplication \u2014 does replication strip away the soul of creation?",
      "Not long ago, I found myself wandering through Paris with a fake Celine handbag slung over my shoulder. In France, a country that prides itself on originating so much of the world\u2019s fashion, punishments for counterfeiting are severe, to the point that I technically risked three years in prison just by carrying my little knockoff around. But the bag\u2019s fraudulence was undetectable to human eyes. I was toting around a delicious, maddening secret: Like a ship remade with identical wood, the bag on my arm had been built on the same plan, with seemingly the same gleaming materials, as the \u201coriginal.\u201d Yet it was considered inauthentic, a trick, a cheat.",
      "My plunge into the world of fantastically realistic counterfeit purses \u2014 known as \u201csuperfakes\u201d to vexed fashion houses and I.P. lawyers, or \u201cunclockable reps\u201d to their enthusiastic buyers \u2014 began a couple of years earlier, in what I might characterize as a spontaneous fit of lunacy. It was early 2021 when, thrown into sensory overload by grisly pandemic headlines, I found my gaze drifting guiltily to an advertisement in the right margin of a news site, where the model Kaia Gerber arched her arms lovingly around a Celine Triomphe \u2014 a plain, itty-bitty rectangular prism that in no universe could possibly be worth, as further research informed me, $2,200.",
      "I shut the tab, horrified. Having grown up a first-generation immigrant whose family\u2019s idea of splurging was a monthly dinner at Pizza Hut, I refused to be the type of person who lusted over luxury handbags. I had always understood that these artifacts were not for me, in the way debutante balls or chartered Gulfstreams were not for me. But, days later and still mired in the quicksand of quarantine, I found myself cracking my laptop and Googling \u201cbuy Celine Triomphe cheap.\u201d This led me to a Reddit community of replica enthusiasts, who traded details about \u201ctrusted sellers\u201d capable of delivering a Chanel 2.55 or Loewe Puzzle or Herm\u00e8s Birkin that promised to be indistinguishable from the original, and priced at a mere 5 percent or so of the M.S.R.P.",
      "Where did these sensational counterfeits come from? Fake goods, as anyone who has ever strolled past the plasticky buffets on the Las Vegas Strip or Manhattan\u2019s Canal Street can tell you, are nothing new or rare. But in the past decade or so, a new breed of knockoff purses has come onto the scene from China \u2014 boasting shockingly good quality and slipping through customs gates like sand through a sieve. And, as many an angry resale buyer ",
      ", they\u2019re able to fool even the most well-trained eye. \u201cIt\u2019s a pervasive, tremendous problem,\u201d Bob Barchiesi, president of the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, told me. Hunter Thompson, who oversees the authentication process at the luxury consignment site the RealReal, elaborated: \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point that you can see something in season replicated within that season.\u201d",
      "What was once a sly novelty has bloomed into a gigantic market. In 2016, a Virginia woman was sentenced for buying $400,000 worth of designer purses from department stores, returning high-quality knockoffs and reselling the real bags for profit; the stores ",
      ". Before the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d star Jen Shah pleaded guilty to telemarketing fraud last year, police raided her house and found shelves and shelves of fake Louis Vuittons mingled with authentic ones. In the pandemic, superfakes went supernova: A killer combo of quarantine malaise, frenzied stimulus-check hobby spending and the rise of sales via social-media sites like Instagram has propelled consumers\u2019 awareness of \u2014 and fervor for \u2014 these hyperrealistic copycats to new heights. Now especially, in the face of rampant inflation, consumers coveting a $10,000 handbag who are advertised a $100 copycat hardly need an extra push.",
      "I WeChatted a seller calling herself Linda \u2014 a name that, amid others like Aadi, Aooko, Mr. Bao and Zippy, made her seem the least likely to scam me and/or get me placed on a C.I.A. watch list \u2014 and instantly she sent me photos of a dozen possible Triomphes. The seller reassured me that I\u2019d have the chance to \u201cQC\u201d (quality-check) the \u201cPSPs\u201d (pre-shipment photos). A \u201chigh tier\u201d version of the bag would come out to about 915 yuan, or $132. Which color would I like?",
      "I hesitated for a few days, then texted her: Cream, please. It was the middle of the night in China, but Linda wrote me back within seconds: Done. It would be at my doorstep in about three weeks.",
      "of duplication in the fashion industry is like trying to rewrap skeins of yarn. Designer houses spend billions fighting dupes, but even real Prada Cleos and Dior Book Totes are made with machines and templates \u2014 raising the question of what, exactly, is unique to an authentic bag. Is it simply a question of who gets to pocket the money? (Herm\u00e8s recently mounted, and won, a trademark war against \u201cMetaBirkin\u201d NFTs.)",
      "Besides, replication is already threaded through the whole history of clothing. Before industrialization, and well before handbags were popularized as accessories, mimicry was essential to dressmaking: Rich women would observe in-vogue silhouettes, then direct their own seamstresses to duplicate the cuts, waistlines or sleeves. It wasn\u2019t until the mass-production inventions of the 19th century that designers became paranoid about the riffraff\u2019s being able to ape their status symbols. In 1951, the American writer Sally Iselin ",

      "In Iselin\u2019s time, such boutiques were a guilty marvel; nowadays, shoppers don\u2019t bat an eye at the idea of snapping up a Balenciaga silhouette from Zara, Shein or AliExpress. Even the superrich crave a good deal, as a Manhattan woman with a treasure trove of superfake Birkins ",
      " last year. On the other side of the world in China \u2014 a country that is known for its fake-making and that had no compunctions about building a ",
      " \u2014 there are, by some estimates, as many as several million people who make a living delivering these good deals.",
      "I spoke with Kelly, one such person, seeking to peek under the hood of the shadowy business. (\u201cKelly\u201d is not her real name; I\u2019m referring to her here by the English moniker that she uses on WhatsApp. I contacted more than 30 different superfake-bag-sellers before one agreed to an interview.) Five years ago, Kelly worked in real estate in Shanghai, but she got fed up with trekking to an office every day. Now she works from home in Guangzhou, often hammering out a deal for a Gucci Dionysus or Fendi Baguette on her phone with one hand, wrangling lunch for her 8-year-old daughter with the other. Kelly finds the whole business of luxury bags \u2014 the sumptuous leather, razor-straight heat stamps, hand stitches, precocious metal mazes of prancing ",
      " and ",
      " and ",
      " and ",
      " \u2014 \u201cway too fussy,\u201d she tells me in Chinese. But the work-life balance is great. As a sales rep for replicas, Kelly makes up to 30,000 yuan, or about $4,300, a month, though she has heard of A-listers who net up to 200,000 yuan a month \u2014 which would work out to roughly $350,000 a year.",
      "On a good day, Kelly can sell more than 30 gleaming Chlo\u00e9s and Yves Saint Laurents, to a client base of mostly American women. \u201cIf a bag can be recognized as fake,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s not a worthwhile purchase for the customer, so I only sell bags that are high-quality but also enticingly affordable \u2014 $200 or $300 is the sweet spot.\u201d Kelly keeps about 45 percent of each sale, out of which she pays for shipping, losses and other costs. The rest is wired to a network of manufacturers who divvy up proceeds to pay for overhead, materials and salaries. When a client agrees to order a bag from Kelly, she contacts a manufacturer, which arranges for a Birkin bag to roll out of the warehouse into an unmarked shipping box in a week or so.",
      "In Guangzhou, where a vast majority of the world\u2019s superfakes are thought to originate, experts have identified two main reasons behind the illicit goods\u2019 lightning-fast new speeds: sophistication in bag-making technology and in the bag-makers themselves.",
      "One such innovation in the latter is a disjointed, flat-string, hard-to-track supply chain. When the intellectual-property lawyer Harley Lewin was the subject of a ",
      " in 2007, he could often be found busting through hidden cellars on raids around the world. But increasingly, Lewin told me, \u201cI\u2019m sort of the guy in the spy novel who\u2019s called \u2018Control\u2019 and sits in a room,\u201d trying to sniff out \u201cthe bad guys\u201d from screenshots of texts and D.M.s. Counterfeiting operations are no longer pyramid-shaped hierarchies with ever-higher bosses to roll: \u201cNowadays it\u2019s a series of blocks, the financier and the designers and the manufacturers, and none of the blocks relate to each other,\u201d Lewin explains. \u201cSo if you bust one block, odds are they can replace it in 10 minutes. The person you bust has very little information about who organizes what and where it goes.\u201d Indeed, Kelly, even though she has sold every color variation of Louis Vuitton Neverfull under the sun, only handles bags in person on rare occasions to inspect quality. Sellers don\u2019t stock inventory. They function as the consumer-facing marketing block, holding scant knowledge of how other blocks operate. Kelly just gets daily texts from a liaison at each outlet, letting her know of their output: \u201cThe factories won\u2019t even tell us where they are.\u201d",
      "As for how the superfakes are achieving their unprecedented verisimilitude, Lewin, who has observed their factories from the inside, says it\u2019s simply a combination of skillful artisanship and high-quality raw materials. Some superfake manufacturers travel to Italy to source from the same leather markets that the brands do; others buy the real bags to examine every stitch. Chinese authorities have little to no incentive to shut down these operations, given their contributions to local economies, the potential embarrassment to local ministers and the steady fraying of China\u2019s political ties with the Western nations where savvy online buyers clamor for the goods. \u201cThey avoid taxes,\u201d Lewin says. \u201cThe working conditions are terrible. But all of that goes to turning out a very high-quality fake at very low cost.\u201d",
      "For replica enthusiasts on Reddit, \u201c187 Factory\u201d is legendary for its top-notch Chanel bags. It commands a premium of $600 for a caviar-leather quilted double-flap \u2014 pricier than a midtier $200 rep, but still far from the bag\u2019s asking price at a Chanel boutique ($10,200) or on resale sites ($5,660 for one in \u201cvery good\u201d condition on Fashionphile, $3,600 for one with \u201cheavy scratches\u201d and \u201cnoticeable balding\u201d on the RealReal). But as Kelly describes it, \u201c187 Factory\u201d sounds like a branding ploy for what\u2019s really just a well-organized chain of blocks, functionally indistinguishable from other miniature companies making premium knockoffs out of the same buckles and patterns. Kelly always lets clients know that she can get them equal-quality bags for less than what the 187 people charge. Still, many buyers insist they must have a \u201cbag from 187.\u201d Some have told Kelly that they\u2019ve saved paychecks for months just to buy a 187 Chanel \u2014 in a curious echo of the fervent consumers doing the same for the authentic bags.",
      "Those whose business it is to verify luxury bags insist, at least publicly, that there\u2019s always a \u201ctell\u201d to a superfake. At the RealReal, where designer handbags go through rounds of scrutiny, including X-rays and measuring fonts down to the millimeter, Thompson told me that \u201csometimes, an item can be ",
      " perfect, ",
      " exacting, so you\u2019ll look at it and know something is up.\u201d And, he added, touch and smell can be giveaways. Rachel Vaisman, the company\u2019s vice president of merchandising operations, said the company will contact law-enforcement officials if it suspects a consignor is sending in items with the intent to defraud.",
      "But one authenticator I spoke with confesses that it\u2019s not always so clear-cut. The fakes \u201care getting so good, to the point that it comes down to inside etchings, or nine stitches instead of eight,\u201d he told me. \u201cSometimes you really have no idea, and it becomes a time-consuming egg hunt, comparing photos on other websites and saying, \u2018Does this hardware look like this one?\u2019\u201d (He asked to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak on behalf of his company.) He and his colleagues have their theories as to how the superfakes that come across their desks are so jaw-droppingly good: \u201cWe suspect it\u2019s someone who maybe works at Chanel or Herm\u00e8s who takes home real leathers. I think the really, really good ones have to be from people who work for the companies.\u201d And every time a brand switches up its designs, as today\u2019s fast-paced luxury houses are wont to do, authenticators find themselves in the dark again.",
      "Though U.S. officials try valiantly to sniff out impostor goods, too, seizing more than 300,000 fake bags and wallets in fiscal year 2022, the sheer volume of counterfeit imports \u2014 fakes in general are estimated to be a bustling, multibillion-dollar industry \u2014 means that authorities are able to inspect, on some estimates, as little as 5 percent of what comes in. For superfake sellers and buyers, those are great odds.",
      "hundreds of anxious Control-Rs on the DHL tracking page, and a daily pondering about what my mother might say when she encountered my mug shot on the evening news, my Celine Triomphe finally materialized \u2014 anticlimactically, in a manner much like anything else I\u2019d ever ordered online. The box was lightly battered from having traveled through Abu Dhabi and, funnily enough, a network of shipping hubs across France and Italy before it landed in my lap in New York. I ripped open the tissue paper to extract the Triomphe, that glorious vessel, my purse of Theseus. By sight, nothing was detectable. I faithfully counted the stitches, measured dimensions. Underneath my hand, the leather did feel a bit stiff, rather less plush than the version I\u2019d fondled for an unnecessary amount of time at Celine\u2019s Soho boutique beforehand. But this giveaway, this \u201ctell,\u201d would graze against my shoulder and no one else\u2019s.",
      "A strange, complicated cloud of emotions engulfed me wherever I carried the bag. I contacted more sellers and bought more replicas, hoping to shake it loose. I toted a (rather fetching) $100 Gucci 1955 Horsebit rep through a vacation across Europe; I\u2019ve worn the Triomphe to celebrity-flooded parties in Manhattan, finding myself preening under the approving, welcome-into-our-fold smiles of wealthy strangers. There is a smug superiority that comes with luxury bags \u2014 that\u2019s sort of the point \u2014 but to my surprise, I found that this was even more the case with superfakes. Paradoxically, while there\u2019s nothing more quotidian than a fake bag that comes out of a makeshift factory of nameless laborers studying how to replicate someone else\u2019s idea, in another sense, there\u2019s nothing more original.",
      "While a wardrobe might reveal something of the wearer\u2019s personality and emotion, a luxury handbag is a hollow basin, expressing nothing individualistic at all. Instead, a handbag communicates certain ineffable ideas: money, status, the ability to move around in the world. And so, if you believe that fashion is inherently all about artifice \u2014 consider wink-wink items like Maison Margiela\u2019s Replica sneaker, or the mind-\u200bboggling profits of LVMH\u2019s mass-produced luxury items \u2014 then there is an argument to be made that the superfake handbag, blunt and upfront to the buyer about its trickery, is the most honest, unvarnished item of all.",
      "I asked the writer Judith Thurman, whose sartorial insights I\u2019ve always admired, about the name-brand handbag\u2019s decades-long hold on women. Why do we yearn for very expensive sacks in the first place? Why do some buyers submit to thousand-dollar price hikes and risk bankruptcy for them? \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of inclusive exclusiveness,\u201d Thurman told me. \u201cA handbag is a little treat, and it\u2019s the only fashion item that is not sacrificial.\u201d Clothes, with their unforgiving size tags and rigid shapes, can instill a cruel horror or disappointment in their wearers. Bags, meanwhile, dangle no shame, only delight. \u201cThere is an intangible sense when you are wearing something precious that makes you feel more precious yourself,\u201d she theorizes. \u201cAnd we all need \u2014 in this unbelievable age of cosmic insecurity \u2014 a little boost you can stick over your shoulder that makes you feel a bit more special than if you were wearing something that cost $24.99. It\u2019s mass delusion, but the fashion business is about mass delusion. At what point does a mass delusion become a reality?\u201d",
      "Thurman\u2019s first designer-bag splurge was an Issey Miyake Bao Bao she bought for the full retail price of about $900. (\u201cIn buying that bag, I became an insane person.\u201d) After it fell apart from wear, she couldn\u2019t justify the price of another \u2014 and Issey Miyake had also stopped making her preferred model. So she went on Alibaba and bought two cheap replicas. \u201cIt was very strange,\u201d Thurman says. \u201cThere was an aura to the real thing that the fake didn\u2019t have. And if you ask me what does that mean, I really almost can\u2019t say. Part of it was the spirit of going to the shop and paying more money than I could afford.\u201d",
      "Volkan Yilmaz goes by Tanner Leatherstein on TikTok, where some 800,000 followers watch him slash and tear popular silhouettes from Chanel or Louis Vuitton apart at the seams to assess whether the quality of any given handbag is \u201cworth it\u201d from a quality and craftsmanship perspective. (Spoiler: Very rarely so. With the exception of Bottega Veneta or Herm\u00e8s.) \u201cA luxury bag\u2019s cost is never about its material,\u201d Yilmaz told me.",
      "That the profits of one idea\u2019s relentless duplications funnel only into one (fat, corporate) pocket is precisely why many younger consumers see fake bags as ",

Replica communities laugh at big luxury firms, taking on a subversive, stick-it-to-the-man attitude.

Jordan T. Alexander, a 29-year-old TikTok creator who has made videos about replica bags, told me she sometimes thinks of them as \u201cthe democratization of fashion.\u201d Trina, a woman who sells imported replicas to customers in Las Vegas and requested to be identified only by her first name, sees the most passion for fakes among middle-class women of color who seem emboldened to find themselves with access to a different world: \u201cA bag gives a woman a more classy demeanor. The woman who is walking out of Target, getting in their vehicle or whatever, feeling good? That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "In the face of widening wealth disparity around the globe, it\u2019s no longer fashionable anyway to gate-keep expensive things.

      "Was I a snob in the original sense or the contemporary one? I\u2019d been drawn to multithousand-dollar designer bags because they felt so elusive and unavailable, but now that they, via superfakes, had become available to me, I no longer really wanted them; the pursuit of them had started to feel, I realized at some point, marvelously worthless.",
      "I asked Kelly what she thought about her clients and their obsessive yearning for these brilliant, mundane, often aesthetically unimaginative tiny objects. I yearned for her to unfurl my unease, to rip open the secret seams and expose something profound.",
      "\u201cYou know, there\u2019s an old saying in Chinese,\u201d Kelly told me.",
      "I thought she was about to recite a fragment of an ancient poem, or to synthesize the joy and genius of superfakes into some wonderful proverb that could reconcile our collective love of duplicity with our human insistence on realism. But Kelly, practical, business-minded and raised on a different side of the world, didn\u2019t find my loose-ended Western anxieties all that interesting. Or maybe she had misunderstood what I was asking. Kelly went on: \u201cThe saying is, \u2018You always get what you pay for.\u2019\u201d",

      "Joel Readence fell in love with the house first.",
      "In May 2021, Mr. Readence, 51, and his partner, Matt Berdine, 46, a sourcing manager for a clothing manufacturer, paid $407,000 for an artfully renovated, three-bedroom antique house with Hudson River views in the Greene County town of Coxsackie, N.Y.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t find Coxsackie \u2014 I found the house,\u201d said Mr. Readence, an executive coach for a large consulting firm, who now splits his time between Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Coxsackie. \u201cAfter sheltering for four months in an 800-square-foot apartment with my partner and our dog, I was on Zillow looking for places in the upstate area. When we saw the cottage and the town and learned a little more about it, it was really appealing to be a part of its renaissance.\u201d",
      "Perched on the west bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles south of Albany, Coxsackie covers roughly 37 square miles \u2014 including an eponymous 2.17-square-mile village \u2014 with a population of 8,382, according to the 2020 census. The nearly five-acre Riverside Park, adjacent to the downtown area, offers stunning views.",
      "\u201cYou just have beautiful, open park space and the most pristine riverfront,\u201d said Aaron Flach, 47, a developer and a Coxsackie native. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful natural landscape that sets us apart from any other community.\u201d",
      "Just a few years ago, Coxsackie\u2019s historic downtown was pocked with boarded-up buildings. Now the Reed Street Historic District has boutique businesses like the Reed Street Bottle Shop and the antiques store UnQuiet. On a six-acre riverside site, Mr. Flach is building a $15 million hospitality project that includes a 47-room hotel with a top-floor restaurant and deck, and a spa inside a restored electric light station. Last November, he opened a 13,000-square-foot event space in a 1906 factory adjoining the hotel site, with a glass atrium overlooking the river. Called The Wire, after the wire manufacturer that once owned the building, it has 27 events booked so far in 2023.",
      "The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation recently made $3.2 million worth of improvements to Riverside Park, including the construction of a pavilion and renovations to the boat launch. And in 2021, the state\u2019s Main Street grant program awarded $347,000 to the Reed Street Historic District to help preserve and protect its buildings.",
      "\u201cBetween Mr. Flach\u2019s project and the park, our entire riverfront area will have been renovated,\u201d said Mark Evans, 57, a Coxsackie native who has been the mayor of the village since 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place on the Hudson.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach, he added, is renovating buildings that \u201chad been vacant since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "The boutique shops popping up in historic buildings near the waterfront have helped the area approach \u201ccritical mass,\u201d said Sarah Gray Miller, 51, a former magazine editor and self-described \u201cmad collector\u201d from Natchez, Miss., who opened UnQuiet in December 2021 after selling her house in nearby ",
      "Her store occupies a 2,400-square-foot, late-19th-century brick building, once the site of a firehouse and a jail, which Ms. Miller rents for $2,500 a month.",
      "Ms. Miller began serving customers wine on Saturday afternoons and soon found herself holding a regular B.Y.O.B. gathering that evolved into a plan to open a bar with Mark Deubert, a fourth-generation Coxsackie resident. Named Ravish Liquors, after a neon sign Ms. Miller found at a Hudson, N.Y., flea market, it is expected to open this month with a Southern bar-food menu that includes crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e.",
      "Coxsackie \u201cis a very civilized place,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly welcoming to all the outsiders moving in. It does not have the same us-versus-them mentality that you see elsewhere in Greene County.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach bought the waterfront property he is developing from the Twelve Tribes \u2014 a ",
      " that runs a chain of cafes called the Yellow Deli, including one in downtown Coxsackie \u2014 for $1 million, along with an 1860s opera house where he plans to create first-floor retail space and 10 apartments. \u201cThis is a huge project for such a small community,\u201d said Mr. Flach, who\u2019s aiming to open the hotel on June 1. \u201cI want to develop a level of vibrancy for the downtown that will bring tourists to the area and support local businesses.\u201d",
      "He also owns more than 100 apartments in town, including two historic brick buildings from the 1880s, and said they are all occupied, with waiting lists.",
      "Historic homes predominate in the village. Outside the village, Coxsackie\u2019s architecture is a mix of styles, with a number of Greek Revival farmhouses reflecting the area\u2019s agrarian past.",
      "The Reed Street Historic District consists of two- and three-story Italianate brick buildings from the mid-1800s, many painted in soft pastels. Small shops that recently have sprung up include Mansion + Reed General Store, which offers specialty groceries, espresso and pastries; Shipwrecked News, Books & Caf\u00e9, which sells sandwiches, homemade bagels, used books, and just received a liquor license; and, a few doors down, the Reed Street Bottle Shop, which carries local wines and spirits, as well as T-shirts and coffee mugs emblazoned with the phonetic spelling of the town\u2019s often mispronounced name: \u201ccook-SAH-kie.\u201d",
      "Susan Baldaserini, an owner of the wine shop and a graphic artist, designed the shirts and mugs. \u201cNow a weekend doesn\u2019t go by where I don\u2019t hear someone in the shop saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s how you say it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In 2015, when Ms. Baldaserini, 43, and her boyfriend and business partner, Shai Kessler, 45, were living in Red Hook, Brooklyn, they bought a weekend house in the neighboring town of New Baltimore. They moved upstate full-time in 2016 to open the wine shop. The following year, Ms. Baldaserini opened Pilothouse Paper, a stationery store that doubles as her graphic-design studio, across the street.",
      "\u201cA lot of people travel up and down 9W without ever knowing Reed Street exists, but if you get the hot tip to turn off 9W and onto Reed Street, it\u2019s truly charming and idyllic,\u201d she said.",
      "As Coxsackie\u2019s profile has risen, so have its home prices. The median sale price for a single-family home in 2022 was $291,000 \u2014 a jump of nearly 22 percent (from $239,000) in 2021, and nearly 53 percent (from $190,500) in 2019. It was more than the $285,000 median sale price in ",
      ", and less than the $329,500 median in ",
      ", according to the Columbia Greene Board of Realtors.",
      "Taxes are relatively low. The average county, town and school tax bill for 2021 was about $4,443 for town residents and $6,188 for village residents, said Raymond Ward, the director of real property tax services for Greene County.",
      "In mid-January, Zillow showed six single-family homes for sale in Coxsackie, from a three-bedroom ranch on 0.23 acres, listed for $189,100, to a six-bedroom home on 9.33 acres along the Hudson River, listed for $899,000.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been seeing is the people who are interested in being full-time also want to either open up a business here or do a satellite of what they\u2019re already doing in the city,\u201d said Dave Merchant, a Coxsackie native and a real estate agent at Keller Williams Hudson Valley North.",
      "Amy Bennett, who owns two businesses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, is shopping for commercial space in Coxsackie to open a farm stand. She splits her time between her Fort Greene brownstone and her Coxsackie house, but plans to spend most of her time upstate once her younger daughter graduates from high school. In addition to Greene Grape Wine & Spirits and Greene Grape Provisions, she owns five properties in Athens, including 58 acres of farmland.",
      "\u201cCoxsackie feels like it\u2019s got big energy from the waterfront development,\u201d said Ms. Bennett, 53, who bought her three-bedroom Victorian house with river views for $375,000 in May 2021. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a bigger rejuvenation going on all at once.\u201d",
      "She likes to grab coffee at Shipwrecked, pick up cream puffs at the Little Bake Shop on Mansion Street and explore the Coxsackie Antique Center in the West Coxsackie business district on Route 9W, where more than 100 antiques dealers sell their wares. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you want for a rainy Saturday, to wander through and see things you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d she said.",
      "Students in the Coxsackie-Athens Central School District attend either Coxsackie Elementary School or Edward J. Arthur Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade. They go on to Coxsackie-Athens Middle School for fifth through eighth grade, and then to Coxsackie-Athens High School.",
      "During the 2020-21 school year, the latest year for which figures were available from the New York State Education Department, the district had an enrollment of 1,188 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. About 85 percent identified as white, 8 percent as Hispanic, 5 percent as multiracial, 2 percent as Black and 1 percent as Asian or Pacific Islander.",
      "On 2021-22 state tests, 86 percent of Coxsackie-Athens High School students were proficient in English, 34 percent were proficient in algebra and 54 percent were proficient in geometry, compared with 81 percent, 66 percent and 53 percent statewide. In 2022, the average SAT verbal score was 546, compared with a statewide average of 534; the average math score was 542, versus 533 statewide.",
      "The high school\u2019s graduation rate in 2021 was 89 percent, compared with 86 percent for the state.",
      "Coxsackie is roughly a seven-minute drive from Exit 21B on the New York State Thruway. The drive to the George Washington Bridge takes about two hours, depending on traffic.",
      "The Amtrak train station in Hudson is about a 25-minute drive. Round-trip tickets to New York City cost $62 to $148, depending on when the ticket is bought and whether it is for peak or off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cThe train back on Thursday or Friday is often booked, because the area has gotten so popular,\u201d Ms. Miller said.",
      "The New York State Legislature created the town of Coxsackie in 1788, and the village was incorporated in 1867.

      "Kyrsten Sinema was standing a few yards from the border wall with four Republican members of Congress. The men were staring balefully at a row of nearby portable toilets, wondering aloud if they could hold out for a proper bathroom on the way back to the airport. Sinema assured Representatives David Valadao of California and Tony Gonzales of Texas that they need not worry on her account.",
      "\u201cIf you know anything about me,\u201d she said, gesturing vaguely out into the desert, \u201cyou know that I\u2019ll go anywhere.\u201d The two men, who were just getting to know the Arizona senator, laughed. \u201cI mean,\u201d Sinema added as she pointed back to the porta-potties, \u201cI come from humble beginnings. That there is some fancy [expletive].\u201d",
      "Valadao, Gonzales and the two other elected officials, Representative Juan Ciscomani of Arizona and Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, all wore jeans and nondescript shirts. Sinema, dressed in a black Western shirt with a white yoke and black jeans with matching spectacles and cowboy boots, exercised her full array of Republican-charming skills throughout the morning. Standing at the wall, she had a detailed exchange with a Border Patrol official for the benefit of the visitors about how Mexican drug cartels managed to ferry fentanyl into Arizona and beyond. At a round-table discussion in the Cochise County sheriff\u2019s office, she moderated a brisk dialogue between her congressional colleagues and beleaguered local officials whose once-quiet communities were now plagued by cartel associates. When the four Republicans responded with harsh criticisms of the Biden administration, Sinema nodded sympathetically, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Sinema \u2014 who four months earlier left the Democratic Party and declared herself an independent \u2014 had orchestrated this April visit for two reasons, one explicit and the other hinted at. The four men joining her at the border had been \u201ccarefully curated\u201d by Sinema, she told me the day before. Tillis had partnered with her on important legislation in the past, and they were now collaborating on what they hoped would be the first major border-and-immigration-reform bill to become law in a generation. Sinema targeted Ciscomani, Gonzales and Valadao, all of whom served on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, as potential recruits for this effort.",
      "Like two other recent legislative accomplishments that Sinema had a major hand in crafting \u2014 the 2021 infrastructure bill and the 2022 gun-safety initiative \u2014 the Sinema-Tillis plan is decidedly half a loaf, for which Sinema offers no apologies. \u201cThe people who want no bread if they can\u2019t get the entire loaf of bread,\u201d she told me, \u201care people who\u2019ve never been hungry.\u201d",
      "But even if less than a full meal, the plan would still be consequential \u2014 increasing funds and equipment for the Border Patrol, reforming the asylum process, addressing backlogs of employment-based visas and providing a path to citizenship for about two million young American residents (the so-called Dreamers) \u2014 and its passage would be an even more improbable achievement than finding common ground on guns last year. \u201cGuns is a high-wire act,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who worked with Sinema on the 2022 law and is now doing the same on immigration, told me. \u201cImmigration is a high-wire act while holding active sticks of dynamite.\u201d",
      "Unlike those earlier legislative tightrope walks, Sinema, who is known for avoiding the news media, was performing this one in public, accompanied by a half-dozen members of the Arizona press as well as myself. It was clear, if unstated, that this was the second reason for going to the border, which most Democrats have assiduously stayed away from amid growing Republican criticism: her 2024 re-election bid. She never once raised the subject during our four interviews over two months. When I did, a day before the border visit, she cheerfully replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question. But I\u2019m glad you started with it. Got it right out of the way!\u201d",
      "\u201cCan you answer at least when you believe you\u2019ll have to make up your mind?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIf you do ",
      " run, or if you run and are defeated, do you have a plan for what you would do next?\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, not really thinking about that.\u201d",
      " had been apparent for months. Why else would she have left the Democratic Party four years into her term, if not to avoid a primary in which the party\u2019s progressive base was guaranteed to turn its wrath on her? Why else was she (as ",
      ") furtively holding staff retreats to lay out a timetable for commissioning polls and opposition research? Nothing she said in our conversations left me with the impression that she was putting a few final touches on her senatorial legacy on her way out the door to the private sector. At the same time, Sinema \u2014 whom even her closest friends describe as calculated, and who described herself to me as \u201cvery intentional\u201d and \u201ca planner\u201d \u2014 almost never telegraphs her strategy. It suited her ends to freeze the 2024 machinations by leaving everyone guessing.",
      "Still, here she was, flanked by Republican legislators and border officials, blanketing the state\u2019s airwaves 19 months before what is sure to be the most complicated race of her two decades in electoral politics. It will also be, aside from the presidential election itself, the most significant contest next year, and it may well decide which party controls the Senate. Over the past two years, the Democrats (with independents) have held the majority by no more than two votes, which has allowed Sinema and another centrist Democrat, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, to command extraordinary influence over the party\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "If Arizona progressives have their way, Sinema will be ousted for repeated apostasies, from protecting the filibuster \u2014 the means by which, according to traditional Senate rules, a minority can block a vote that a frustrated majority would otherwise be able to move forward \u2014 to siding with private-equity donors. If Sinema has hers, Arizona voters across the political spectrum will reward her displays of discerning bipartisanship in an age of mindless party loyalty. It could also be the case that Sinema and her likely Democratic rival, Representative Ruben Gallego, will do sufficient damage to each other to ensure that the winner is a Republican, perhaps losing the Senate majority in the process.",
      "But additional implications come into play should Sinema prevail as an independent. \u201cThese are very different times,\u201d Tillis told me, \u201cand from the polls I\u2019ve seen, an increasing number of voters are saying, \u2018I\u2019m not buying what the far left and far right are selling.\u2019 Now, whether that sentiment transfers to an electoral map is still unclear. But if voters really are saying, \u2018Give me a viable alternative,\u2019 then Sinema has a pretty solid argument to make.\u201d",

Since announcing his candidacy in late January, Gallego has outraised Sinema, $3.7 million to $2.1 million, but she has almost four times as much money in the bank as he does.",
      "Most of all, she is betting that her lawmaking acumen will attract a new coalition of Arizona voters. No one unaffiliated with either of the two parties has ever won statewide office there. For Sinema to do so, according to Chuck Coughlin, a prominent Republican consultant in Arizona, \u201cshe needs 20 to 25 percent of Democratic voters, 25 to 30 percent of Republicans and 50 to 60 percent of self-identified independents.\u201d",

      " against Donald Trump in 2020, as well as Gov. Katie Hobbs, who received almost 11 percent of the Republican vote in her 2022 victory over the far-right Kari Lake.",
      "Of course, those candidates also benefited from their party\u2019s overwhelming support. Sinema, even before she left the party in December, had become the Democrat whom Democrats love to hate.

      " (Sinema says she voted as she did because the minimum-wage provision did not belong in a reconciliation bill, which must be budgetary in nature to qualify for passage by a simple majority. A spokeswoman also says that she curtsied out of gratitude for the Senate clerk\u2019s late-hour labors and that she was not the only senator that night who signified \u201cno\u201d using the thumbs-down gesture.)",

      " \u201cThe decision was really a no-brainer,\u201d a former state party official told me, adding that the censure resolution was supported by more than 90 percent of Arizona\u2019s Democratic precinct committee members. In a foreshadowing of her formal break from the party, Sinema endorsed but did not campaign for any of her fellow Arizona Democrats during the 2022 midterms, including two longtime friends, Katie Hobbs and the attorney general candidate Kris Mayes, both of whom won, but barely. Mayes in particular needed all the help she could get, prevailing by a mere 280 votes. Hobbs, on the other hand, relied heavily on the turnout of a progressive base that might have reacted poorly to Sinema\u2019s presence on the stump. To campaign for one and not the other would have underscored just how problematic Sinema had become for her fellow Democrats.",
      "All that said, by Coughlin\u2019s calculation, Sinema will still have to garner the support of 20 to 25 percent of Arizona\u2019s Democrats who are somehow unbothered by the spectacle of their former Democratic senator now chumming it up with Republicans while disparaging the Biden administration. The notion that wooing Democrats is likely to be Sinema\u2019s most difficult task constitutes a striking reversal in the political career of a prominent Arizona progressive whose election to the Senate in 2018 was celebrated by the party as a historic breakthrough.",
      "Since that high moment, their shared history has been like a marriage of convenience in which they shamelessly used the other until, perhaps inevitably, they came to have only distrust in common. By ending the charade, Sinema is gambling that she can manage the fallout and ultimately be rewarded for her declaration of independence. Whether that happens \u2014 whether she succeeds in making her case as America\u2019s indispensable consensus builder in the Senate \u2014 depends in no small measure on whether the party Sinema left behind can remember more than just the bad times.",

One girl asked the 46-year-old senator for some tips on how to handle the negativity that came her way.",
      "\u201cTake the time to be OK with yourself,\u201d Sinema answered. \u201cIf someone says something bad about you, it falls in a place that\u2019s soft. But if you\u2019re OK with yourself, you know that what they\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t matter, and it doesn\u2019t land so hard.\u201d",
      "At times, Sinema employs the empathic language of the social worker she was straight out of college. Even in those moments, however, she is never one to mince words, or to linger. Sinema observes no religious faith, but she is worshipful of efficiency. She obtained advanced degrees \u2014 a J.D., a Ph.D. in justice studies and an M.B.A. \u2014 the same years, respectively, in which she won seats to the State House (2004), the U.S. House (2012) and the U.S. Senate (2018).

      "\u201cSo, to a regular person, this probably sounds insane,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cBut I need those five minutes. I have something planned for those five minutes. I don\u2019t waste five minutes. I know that is unusual. That is how I\u2019ve always been.\u201d",
      "The two young aides who accompanied her were scowling wordlessly at their smartphones nearby. The scheduling misstep, Sinema said, had been handled. \u201cI don\u2019t waste emotions,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t have guilt or regret, because those are useless emotions.\u201d When I suggested that guilt could be a constructive force for change, Sinema corrected me. Remorse could be constructive, she said. Guilt could not: \u201cIt\u2019s a useless emotion that hurts you, and nothing else.\u201d",

Desai, a prominent election-law attorney who represented Arizona\u2019s secretary of state in 2020 election cases, once served as campaign counsel to Sinema, who had recommended her to Biden\u2019s team. Sinema ran to catch Romney after his vote. She asked him to reconsider, adding that Desai was a personal friend. Romney told me: \u201cShe responded to my concerns and convinced me to go back and change my vote. And I wouldn\u2019t do that for just anybody.\u201d Desai would ultimately be confirmed by a vote of 67 to 29, with more bipartisan support than any federal judicial nominee had received in over 20 years.",
      "Sinema told me that Biden\u2019s chief of staff at the time, Ron Klain, had expressed doubts that she could find any Republican support for Desai. It was this lack of faith in Sinema\u2019s abilities that compelled her to later \u2014 at a fund-raiser filled with ",

Nor does she adhere to the Beltway ritual of appearing on the Sunday talk shows. In her view, they produce only \u201cnoise,\u201d though it\u2019s also the case that Sinema\u2019s sometimes cutting utterances do not come off well in such staid settings. Her aversion to publicly revealing her hand differentiates Sinema from Manchin, a voluble regular on the Sunday shows.",
      "Some have inferred from her reticence that Sinema either is incapable of defending her positions or has no actual positions to defend \u2014 that she arrives at her decisions capriciously and only after drawing maximum attention to herself. To her friends, like Murphy, the former congresswoman, this view bears more than a whiff of sexism and misses the point: \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s playing the inside game, rather than the media game, demonstrates that she\u2019s a professional who shows respect for people, even the ones who\u2019ve disrespected her. If you\u2019re a real legislator and you want to get stuff done, you have to build trust. The minute you call the press or sic the activists on someone to try and apply pressure, you\u2019ve lost that person\u2019s trust.\u201d",
      "I asked Sinema if she found it surprising that someone of her unorthodox character would come to be regarded as a kind of throwback to a less-partisan era, even as a Senate institutionalist. \u201cI think what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she evenly replied, \u201cis you\u2019re mistaking someone who\u2019s not interested in marching to someone else\u2019s drum or following their rules, which are petty and dumb, as being somehow incompatible with wanting to preserve and protect the fundamentals of our democracy.\u201d",
      " Kyrsten Sinema \u2014 14 years old at the time but considerably younger in appearance \u2014 stood before the school board in DeFuniak Springs, Fla., accompanied by her high school guidance counselor, Cynthia Jeselnik. The girl explained that she had already taken every required and honors class her school had to offer. Now she wished to take courses at Okaloosa-Walton Community College (now Northwest Florida State College), 31 miles away in Niceville. Her goal, as Jeselnik would recall to me, \u201cwas to graduate early, so that she could get on with her life and with the course she had laid out for herself.\u201d",
      "The young honors student did not have to state the obvious, which was that she saw no future for herself in a rural community with a poverty rate that was close to 25 percent. Nor did she share the particulars of her personal life, with either her counselor or the board: how she had been born into a comfortable middle-class family in Tucson, Ariz., and had nurtured ambitions since she was 6, when she proclaimed to her first-grade teacher that she intended one day to be a U.S. senator and an author; how her world caved in when her father, an attorney, was suspended indefinitely for \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, deceit and misrepresentation\u201d in 1983; how the family\u2019s car was subsequently repossessed and her mother, a devout Mormon, left the marriage and became involved with a teacher in the girl\u2019s elementary school; how she, her two siblings, her mother and her new stepfather abruptly left Arizona, driving cross-country to his family\u2019s community in DeFuniak Springs; how the family, with the stepfather struggling to find work, lived for nearly three years in a former gas station, while she and her siblings wore hand-me-down clothes provided by the local Mormon church and ate meals provided by the church and federal food assistance. ",
      "What she did say, when the board members advised her simply to find some way to busy herself at her high school, was: \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste a year doing this. Why are you holding me back?\u201d",
      "The school board acquiesced, and the girl, now 15, then drove her parents\u2019 car without a license to take night classes in Niceville. A year later, Sinema was ready to graduate as Walton High School\u2019s co-valedictorian. When she learned that only a member of the senior class could qualify for that top distinction, she and Jeselnik again petitioned school officials. \u201cThese are dumb rules,\u201d Sinema informed them, a preview of how she would later view Beltway mores.",
      "\u201cShe ended up getting a couple of school-district policies changed,\u201d her former counselor recalled. But other things the 16-year-old girl could not alter. Sinema had both the grades and the desire to apply to Harvard. Her parents, however, would not agree to this. Instead, she went to Brigham Young University, the Mormon institution in Provo, Utah, and her family moved to Utah with her. When she graduated from B.Y.U. just before her 19th birthday, she headed back to Arizona, leaving Utah, the Mormon Church and her family behind for good.",
      "The tightly knit community of Phoenix progressives saw in Sinema a fellow idealist, perhaps not fully appreciating at the time how the emotional scar tissue from her earlier years had hardened her into a survivor. She spent her first years in the city as a social worker, learning Spanish as she handled rough cases involving domestic abuse and shootings in the north-side barrios. Frustrated by her inability to improve the lives of immigrants and low-income families in a more sweeping way, she was urged by a local environmental activist named Sandy Bahr to go to law school or seek elective office. \u201cI suggested those two things,\u201d Bahr recalled, \u201cand she decided to do both at the same time.\u201d",
      "Sinema\u2019s early years as an outspoken liberal voice in Arizona politics would later be used against her \u2014 first by Republicans who mocked her Green Party ties and the ",
      " then by progressives who called her a sellout. At a rally she helped organize in 2002 to protest the Patriot Act, Sinema insisted that anyone bringing a firearm be turned away, explaining later, \u201cWe believe in world disarmament.\u201d That same year, she ran for the State House for the first time, without a party affiliation, declaring that among her chief priorities was \u201cstatewide responsible growth aimed at stopping sprawl.\u201d She finished last among the five candidates.",
      "By 2009, when she published a book titled \u201cUnite and Conquer,\u201d Sinema had settled on a tidy autobiographical summation that she promotes to this day \u2014 that of a lonely \u201cbomb thrower\u201d in the State Legislature who saw the light after a few months of misery and then became a happy consensus builder who \u201cgets stuff done.\u201d As with most political narratives, her distillation is more than a little reductive. Sinema did in fact get stuff done \u2014 notably leading the defeat of a ban on same-sex marriage \u2014 by reaching across the aisle. She did in fact, to the horror of her liberal friends, develop warm relations with Arizona conservatives like State Senator Russell Pearce, the author of the notoriously anti-immigration law known as S.B. 1070 (which allowed Arizona officers to arbitrarily demand a citizen\u2019s immigration papers), and Andy Biggs, the future chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.",
      "But she remained an unambiguous progressive well after she abandoned her bomb-throwing ways. In 2006, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators nationwide marched to protest a House Republican bill aiming to crack down on illegal immigration; a photograph of State Representative Sinema locking arms with Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva and other Arizona Democrats hung in her office for years afterward.",
      "\u201cI see interviews of A.O.C., and I\u2019m always struck by how much she was like Kyrsten in those days,\u201d recalled David Lujan, the Arizona Democrats\u2019 minority leader during Sinema\u2019s tenure, referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat. \u201cShe was ",
      " beloved progressive.\u201d At the same time, Lujan went on, \u201cshe studied polls more than anybody I knew.\u201d",
      " then a New York congressman and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, received a phone call from an Arizona state senator. Israel knew nothing about Kyrsten Sinema, apart from the fact that she was considering running for a seat representing the newly created Ninth Congressional District. Come to Phoenix, she told him, and I\u2019ll give you a rundown of all the likely Democratic candidates. (Sinema says she did not call to suggest the meeting; Israel maintains that she did.)",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s my point,\u201d she said with a smile.",

      "Holding his gaze, she replied: \u201cI wanted to be in the same room with you. I wanted you to see who I am.\u201d",
      "Impressed but still skeptical, Israel did not put his thumb on the scale for Sinema, who went on to thrash her Democratic opponents in the 2012 primary anyway. After eking out a victory over a Republican Tea Party candidate in November, she was ",

She organized dinner parties at her apartment and taught spinning classes in the House gym. Her flamboyant wardrobe stood out in a city where, she said in a speech to an L.G.B.T.Q. group back home, \u201cthey think that navy is like a fashion-forward choice.\u201d",
      "Having won a hotly contested district, Sinema was immediately designated a \u201cfront line\u201d member by the D.C.C.C. whose seat was at risk for the 2014 cycle. Sinema joined the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate Democrats. She made good on her campaign pledge to vote against Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader. During votes on the House floor, the freshman could be seen staring up at the tally board, openly agonizing, often casting her ballot just as time elapsed. A colleague recalled Sinema\u2019s wrestling with whether to leave the Ninth District and move to a safer one. A former aide remembered that she met with Israel to discuss the matter. He advised her that if she had any future interest in being a senator in a red state like Arizona, staying in a moderate district would improve her prospects. Sinema stayed.",
      "She handily won a second House term, then a third in 2016. Her acumen had become evident to senior members like the minority whip Steny H. Hoyer, who made Sinema his assistant whip in 2014, and her Republican colleague on the Financial Services Committee, Patrick T. McHenry, who told me, \u201cI viewed her as a student of power politics and how to be a meaningful player in the House.\u201d It did not escape McHenry\u2019s notice that Sinema acquired friendships on his side of the aisle \u2014 not just heavy hitters like Kevin McCarthy, the eventual House speaker, but also staunch ideologues like Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma. As the Republicans\u2019 chief deputy whip, McHenry found that whenever he needed Democratic votes, the Democratic assistant whip would be candid about what she could or could not deliver. Sinema, meanwhile, encouraged new moderate members to vote against the party line if it suited them politically \u2014 saying of Pelosi and Hoyer: \u201cThey\u2019ll be mad at you, but they\u2019ll get over it. Vote your district \u2014 it doesn\u2019t help anyone if you lose.\u201d",
      "In September 2017, Sinema declared her candidacy for the Senate against Jeff Flake, the Republican incumbent whose criticisms of President Donald Trump had caused his approval rating to tank back home. Democratic leaders immediately threw their support behind the three-term congresswoman, recognizing that no one else in their party had a shot in a state that had not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1988.",
      "Three weeks after Sinema declared, Flake announced that he would not be seeking another term. While the Republican front-runner, Martha McSally, fought off a primary challenge by wedding herself to Trump, Sinema angled for Arizona\u2019s growing suburban electorate.

Two days after her victory, the state\u2019s first female senator-elect returned to Washington to participate in the Democratic caucus\u2019s leadership vote. Though she had pledged not to vote for Senator Chuck Schumer as minority leader, when no challenger emerged, she joined her new colleagues to reinstall him in the role. Explaining her reversal, Sinema said in a statement, \u201cArizonans know I will work with anyone \u2014 in either party \u2014 to get things done for our state.\u201d",
      " she got to the Senate,\u201d Chris Murphy told me, \u201cI could see her during votes spending at least as much time on the Republican side, if not more, chatting them up. At first, I didn\u2019t know what she was doing over there. But then I figured it out. It was coldblooded. She was clearly setting herself up as someone who could bring the two sides together.\u201d",
      "Sinema first introduced herself to Senator Rob Portman, a conservative Republican from Ohio, and his wife back in 2015, while they and others were accompanying John Lewis at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., to commemorate the heroism of Lewis and other civil rights marchers who were brutally beaten by police officers a half-century earlier. \u201cKyrsten is not someone who is difficult to get to know,\u201d Portman told me. Like Sinema, Portman, whose son is gay, was a supporter of same-sex marriage.",
      "It turned out that the two senators had something else in common, which became evident in early 2021, when Sinema began to hold meetings to discuss bipartisan infrastructure legislation. Though several of her colleagues agreed on the worthiness of the endeavor, it was Portman who stayed behind at the first meeting and began working on a spreadsheet.",
      "The new legislative partners began with three baselines. One was Biden\u2019s stated preference that a federal investment in infrastructure be at least $600 billion in new spending. The second was that the bill be limited to only core infrastructure projects, including broadband. The third was Portman\u2019s insistence that the money not come from raising taxes \u2014 a red line that was also to Sinema\u2019s liking, but it was more effective to be able to tell her Democratic colleagues that a tax hike would be a nonstarter among Republicans.",
      "For two months, Sinema and Portman pored over infrastructure frameworks that various Senate committees had previously drawn up. The working group then expanded from two senators to 10, then to 20. They met in various hideaways and Capitol conference rooms. \u201cShe set deadlines, and she asked for deliverables on certain dates,\u201d said Romney, a key participant in the discussions. \u201cI won\u2019t mention names, but there were a few folks in our group, a couple in particular, who were inclined to spin out with various stories and experiences they\u2019d had in the past that they thought were relevant. And she would cut them off, even though they were far senior to her. She would say: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get back to the topic at hand. We need to get this resolved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Romney went on: \u201cAnd there were several times where we faced what we thought were dispositive roadblocks. A lot of us were inclined to say, \u2018OK, we just can\u2019t get there.\u2019\u201d At such moments, members often stormed out. But, Romney told me, \u201cshe would go get them and bring them back. She\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve got to get there. We don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Sinema-Portman infrastructure bill passed the Senate that August on an impressively bipartisan 69-to-30 vote. But its progress in the House was complicated by the multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better social-spending bill championed by Democratic progressives who threatened to hold the infrastructure bill hostage until Sinema and Manchin agreed to pass the bills in tandem. Neither of them would do so. Manchin\u2019s public explanation was that Build Back Better\u2019s cost was too high amid rising inflation, geopolitical instability and the pandemic. Sinema gave no public explanation at all. But she had already privately informed both Schumer and the Biden White House that the highest price tag she would agree to was $1.1 trillion \u2014 and that, as a friend of hers would say, \u201cshe wanted to be able to tell Arizonans that she didn\u2019t raise their taxes.\u201d",
      "In September 2021, Sinema attended a meeting of House and Senate Democrats at the White House to discuss what Biden hoped would be a $2 trillion version of Build Back Better. According to two of the attendees, Biden first asked each of the senators to articulate their concerns. When it was her turn, Sinema demurred, saying she wanted to hear what the House members had to say first.",
      "\u201cWell, if you\u2019re still at $1 trillion,\u201d Biden interjected, \u201cthen you might as well get up and leave.\u201d",

      "Then, seeming to recognize that losing Sinema\u2019s support would ensure defeat, Biden backed down, saying, \u201cPlease sit down.\u201d",
      "Sinema did so. Toward the end of the meeting, she said to the president: \u201cI told you that in confidence. And if that ends up in the press, I\u2019ll know it was someone from this room.\u201d (The White House did not respond to requests for comment.)",
      "The meeting concluded without further rancor. But the president did not direct House Democrats to let the bills be voted on separately. Sinema suspected that the White House was hoping she would relent. \u201cI would never in my life crack under pressure,\u201d Sinema told me. \u201cWhy would they think I\u2019m going to do it?\u201d",
      "She got her way in the end. On Nov. 5, 2021, the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in the House. Ten days later, Biden signed it into law. Sinema, meanwhile, continued to draw the ire of Democrats for opposing Build Back Better. In a rare interview with CNN, she refused to specify what it would take to change her mind, saying only, \u201cI won\u2019t support any legislation that increases burdens on Arizona or American businesses and reduces our ability to compete either globally or domestically.\u201d The legislation lay dormant into the following year.",
      "On May 24, 2022, a teenager armed with an AR-15-style rifle walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and massacred two teachers and 19 children. Sinema responded to the ",
      " which was widely denounced as proof that she had no intention of responding with concrete action. A day later, Chris Murphy \u2014 who, after the shocking Sandy Hook school shooting a decade earlier in his state, emerged as the Democrats\u2019 foremost advocate for gun reform \u2014 happened to read that Sinema had paused at an elevator in the Capitol to inform members of the news media that she would like to work with Republicans on the gun issue. The news initially struck Murphy as improbable: Sinema had effectively stopped talking to the Washington press.",
      "Murphy texted her: \u201cAre you serious?\u201d",
      "Sinema responded that she was. Within two hours, Murphy was sitting in her hideaway office in the basement of the Capitol. Later that day, Sinema walked onto the Senate floor and located the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cWho should I work with on guns?\u201d she asked him.",
      "She and McConnell had been friendly for some time, and she met frequently with him during the infrastructure deliberations. Later in 2022, she would go to his state, Kentucky, to speak at the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center, where she was praised by the minority leader as \u201cthe most effective first-term senator I\u2019ve seen in my time in the Senate.\u201d Now, responding to her question on the Senate floor, McConnell replied, \u201cJohn Cornyn and Thom Tillis.\u201d Sinema promptly texted them both. The next day, the two Republican senators and Sinema and Murphy were in her hideaway, devising a legislative framework. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a day when the four of us weren\u2019t talking multiple times,\u201d Tillis told me.",
      "That June, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Against the wishes of the powerful National Rifle Association, an astonishing 14 Senate Republicans voted for the bill, including the minority leader; as Murphy would tell me, \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t pass it without McConnell\u2019s support, and Kyrsten was in ongoing conversations with him.\u201d The bill did not address military-style rifles like the ones used by the Uvalde shooter or extend background checks to internet and gun-show sales, measures that were guaranteed to be blocked by a Republican filibuster. It did, however, provide enhanced penalties for straw purchases, add extra steps to background checks for purchasers who are 18 to 21 and close the so-called boyfriend loophole, which allowed abusive partners to own a gun even with an order of protection against them.",
      "\u201cSenator Sinema stepped up and played a critical role in passing what happened to be the most substantive and lifesaving gun legislation in a generation,\u201d Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, the nation\u2019s most influential gun-control group, told me. Still, though Watts, Murphy and other gun-safety advocates continue to press for a ban on military-style rifles, Sinema told me that she was unlikely to take up the cause. \u201cThe reason is pretty simple,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic. I don\u2019t spend my time in the world of fantasy. I spend my time in the world of the possible.\u201d",
      "Two months after the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was enacted, the path to the possible was found once again: Sinema and the Biden administration had reached a deal on the social-spending bill formerly known as Build Back Better. Now rechristened the Inflation Reduction Act, the initiative would spend roughly $500 billion to fund clean-energy programs and extend the Affordable Care Act. The accord with Sinema broke the deadlock, allowing for swift passage \u2014 and a win for the Biden White House.",
      "Still, progressives were not of the mind to applaud the Arizona senator, who had extracted a significant price in exchange for her support: The bill would no longer be paid for in part by closing the carried-interest loophole, which allowed wealthy private-equity executives to claim much of their compensation as investment gains rather than as taxable income. As reporters were quick to note, Sinema had received over $2 million in campaign donations from the investment sector over the previous decade. (And hundreds of thousands ",
      " was passed.)",
      "Sinema\u2019s rationale for supporting private-equity firms is rooted in the economic growth of Arizona, which, she claims, depends on affordable-housing construction that is underwritten by such firms. \u201cSo to me, it makes no sense to disincentivize the supply side of creating that affordable housing in multifamily units,\u201d Sinema told me.",
      "Her solution was to finance the Inflation Reduction Act by increasing the corporate minimum tax, ensuring that all businesses would pay at least 15 percent. This, Sinema said, made more sense than increasing the overall corporate tax \u2014 \u201cif your goal is tax fairness, which is mine.\u201d",
      "If that was her goal, I asked, then was she actually saying that the carried-interest loophole for the ultrawealthy was fair?",
      "\u201cWhat I think it is,\u201d she said, \u201cis an important tool to incentivize investment.\u201d",
      "An earlier version of Kyrsten Sinema \u2014 for example, the 2012 congressional candidate whose opening campaign ad promised that she would be a voice for \u201cthe powerless\u201d \u2014 would most likely have labeled her argument a defense of \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d It was also a shaky position on its own terms.",
      "I asked Arthur C. Nelson, emeritus professor of urban planning and real estate development at the University of Arizona, whether the carried-interest loophole was crucial to his state\u2019s real estate economy. Nelson sent me a set of numbers showing that the annual population growth rate in the three-decade period before the carried-interest provision was formalized in 1993 was 3.3 percent. In the three decades after the loophole was codified, annual growth was 2.1 percent. Assuming, as Nelson did, that population and real estate investment growth were correlated, then the carried-interest loophole had not spawned a housing boom. \u201cThe logic is nonsense,\u201d he said. Closing the loophole and using the revenue on homeowner and builder subsidies \u201cwould generate more housing than simply reducing taxes.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cIn full disclosure, I indeed benefit from the carried-interest loophole. But I personally oppose it for its lack of fairness. I worry that Senator Sinema\u2019s financial thinking is being led by self-styled \u2018masters of the finance universe,\u2019 instead of the masses who voted for her \u2014 me included.\u201d",
      " there was snow on the ground in the town of Whiteriver on the Fort Apache Reservation in northeastern Arizona, which the senator treaded through gingerly in the same boots she would wear at the border a month later. She was here to meet with members of the White Mountain Apache tribe at their invitation.",
      "For the next hour, Sinema sat in a crowded conference room, asking questions and taking notes as the tribal leaders discussed their need for more housing, more police cars and a jail with a roof that wouldn\u2019t collapse. Other than myself, only a couple of members from the tribal community media were present. Private security accompanied her. (Sinema has received death threats; at one point, her stepbrother, Paul Sheldon, told me, he and Sinema\u2019s father were informed by F.B.I. officials that threats had been made against them as well.)",
      "After hosting a few town halls with constituents during her first two years in the Senate, Sinema had since abandoned the practice, except for regular \u201ctele town halls\u201d on a virtual basis. Events like this one \u2014 small and restricted \u2014 have become the norm. To some friends, her reclusiveness is as inevitable as her break from the Democratic Party. \u201cI\u2019ve never in my life seen someone treated as poorly as they treated Sinema,\u201d the former Democratic congresswoman Kathleen Rice told me. \u201cTo me, it made all the sense in the world that she rejected the label of being a Democrat.\u201d Still, it seems impossible for her to continue to avoid openly engaging with Arizonans and somehow manage to win their votes in 2024.",
      "There was one additional item on the agenda that morning at the Fort Apache Reservation. The tribal leaders wanted to thank Sinema for ensuring that the community had at last gained access to clean drinking water. \u201cI worked with Republicans and Democrats in both chambers in the waning days of December to overcome the obstacles,\u201d Sinema told them. She then singled out three partners, all Republicans: Senators Tillis and Lee, and the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Bruce Westerman.",
      "These efforts have not been previously reported. When it came time to dole out favors in the 2021 infrastructure bill, among Sinema\u2019s requests was that all five Arizona tribes be guaranteed clean water. Tillis told her that he had an issue. He and his fellow North Carolina Republican, Senator Richard Burr, had put a hold on all tribal bills for the past three years. When she asked why they had done so, Tillis explained that the Lumbee tribe of North Carolina had yet to be federally recognized. Sinema pledged to help. \u201cKyrsten became the first legislator to invest time in what we were trying to accomplish for the Lumbees,\u201d Tillis told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why Burr and I agreed to remove the holds.\u201d",
      "Then Sinema learned that Lee, because of his longstanding view that tribal economic development should not require federal approval, had put holds on ",
      " tribal bills. She proceeded to work Lee as well. To Lee\u2019s aide who works on the issue, Sinema described the merits of what were now five individual Arizona tribal water bills. One day in mid-December, she received a text from the Utah senator. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d it said. Lee had pulled the holds.",
      "Finally, Sinema spoke with Westerman, a congressman from Arkansas whom she befriended back when she served in the House. He, too, had concerns: that the bills as written did not provide accounting for the expenditures. Sinema added language that did so. She called Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader for whom she had once been assistant whip, who now agreed to put the bills on the suspension calendar, making them eligible to pass by a voice vote. The amendments to the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act became law on Jan. 5, 2023.",
      "As I watched the tribal leaders present Sinema with an Apache blanket and a ceremonial basket, I remembered her friend Stephanie Murphy saying of her, \u201cI\u2019ve never met a person more focused or strategic.\u201d What was the strategic aim here? I recalled our conversation in February about her being five minutes late because of a driving-distance miscalculation that was immediately remedied. \u201cEverything is like a puzzle,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd so if there\u2019s a problem, we should solve it.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo you approach legislation as a puzzle?\u201d I asked her.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201c",
      ".\u201d She then went on: \u201cI think one of the big problems in negotiations is that often some \u2014 not exclusively men, but often men \u2014 are so busy talking about what they need, they\u2019re not spending any time hearing what someone else needs. But the key to solving a problem is to listen carefully and find out what someone needs and then figure out how to get it for them. If you give them what they need, you can get what you want.\u201d",
      "Was simply delivering clean water to the Apaches what Sinema wanted, or was there some electoral angle on the distant horizon? Maybe she needed Democrats to see her tending to the needs of the \u201cpowerless,\u201d as she had pledged to do when she first ran for Congress in 2011. Maybe an independent like Sinema needed to find votes wherever she could get them. Or perhaps it was satisfying enough simply to solve a puzzle that others couldn\u2019t. Making the system work was her greatest value, Portman told me: \u201cBy resolving disputes over amendments, over nominees, she helps the Senate operate.\u201d",
      "Sinema\u2019s role in the operation of the Senate during one of the most polarized periods in American political history has contributed to a remarkably successful legislative record for Democrats to showcase next year. \u201cHere\u2019s a woman who\u2019s delivered them major victories,\u201d Stephanie Murphy told me, \u201cand they campaign on this, after vilifying her.\u201d",
      "As strange as this eventuality might be, Sinema is not entirely blameless for it. An unnamed Democratic legislator told Politico that Sinema was \u201cthe biggest egomaniac in the Senate,\u201d which, if it were true, would be quite a distinction. None of her admiring colleagues \u2014 including Portman, Tillis and Romney \u2014 would deny Sinema\u2019s high estimation of her own abilities. But they described her to me as a uniquely skilled workhorse who deserved at least as much credit as she had been given, if not more. \u201cEveryone\u2019s out there campaigning on what she and a few of us did,\u201d Representative Scott Peters, a Democratic moderate from California and an ally of Sinema\u2019s, told me, referring to her stewardship of the infrastructure bill. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me, sort of funny in a way. I guess the legislation has to be its own reward sometimes.\u201d",
      "Peters entered Congress with Sinema in 2013. Together they worked on bills ranging from wildfire prevention to mental health care for veterans. He remembered meeting her at a restaurant, where he found her poring over a spreadsheet that was color-coded with infrastructure revenue options. It saddened him to think about her leaving the Democratic Party. When I asked Peters whether he would support her or Ruben Gallego in 2024, he paused before saying: \u201cIt may be awkward. I\u2019ll just say that Kyrsten Sinema has been my friend, and if she asked for my support, it would be hard to turn her down.\u201d",
      "He laughed ruefully. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to find friends in D.C. Just ask Kyrsten.\u201d",

      "Bridgeport was once unavoidable. In the middle of the last century, the waterfront Fairfield County city 60 miles from Manhattan churned out so many kinds of products, it seemed to be almost single-handedly shaping the habits of modern life. Rolling off the assembly lines there: lipstick cases, flashlights, typewriters, fans, underwear, sewing machines, cars, scissors, guns, lace, drills, helicopters and phonograph records.",
      "But some people are only familiar with the aftermath: crumbling factories languishing along major roads and railways, an inescapable reminder of a painful loss.",
      "\u201cI told my wife, \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of Bridgeport. It\u2019s too rundown,\u2019\u201d said Andy Toledo, 43. It didn\u2019t help that a favorite TV show of his, \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d mocked the city as a place of \u201cwild dogs and gas stations without pumps.\u201d",
      "But in 2021, when Mr. Toledo and his family sought to relocate to Connecticut from their cramped condo in Mott Haven, in the Bronx, they found places like Easton and Milford too pricey, driven up by the pandemic buying spree. And Mr. Toledo soon realized that parts of Bridgeport \u2014 Connecticut\u2019s largest city, with about 148,000 residents \u2014 felt revitalized, including the North End near the Trumbull border, where the Toledos bought a new three-bedroom house in December 2021 for $390,000. Mr. Toledo shares the home with his wife, Yariliz Marquez-Toledo, 42, who works remotely for a Manhattan health clinic, and their 15-year-old son (another son is in college in Boston).",
      "Even gritty areas appear to be on the mend, although the process is happening in fits and starts. Apartments, breweries and antiques shops have popped up in some of the industrial hulks. Long-empty lots that resemble prairies are being eyed as sites for housing. And a two-year-old concert venue known as the Amp has added bounce to the city\u2019s nightlife.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is reminiscent of what happened in Mott Haven,\u201d as developers try to remake a depressed area, said Mr. Toledo, who recently left his job in New York City government to work at Bridgeport City Hall and help with the comeback. \u201cThe city\u2019s turning itself around.\u201d",
      "Making peace with the old stigma often allows buyers to find a home that feels hidden in plain sight. For two decades, Janine Sjonvall, a database manager, lived a few miles away in Fairfield. Apart from occasional trips to Bridgeport for minor-league baseball games or pizza, she didn\u2019t give it much thought. It took an online house search for her to discover what was just around the corner: an upscale Bridgeport neighborhood called Black Rock, where homes are cheaper than in Fairfield, even if property taxes are higher.",
      "A three-bedroom Dutch colonial-style house there, which cost $378,000 in 2020, is her home today. \u201cIt seems everybody is moving farther out of New York; people who used to buy in Norwalk are in Stratford,\u201d said Ms. Sjonvall, 54. \u201cI just stumbled upon this place, but I\u2019m pleased.\u201d",
      "Of course, development often leads to gentrification, which can encourage landlords to evict tenants and replace them with higher-paying ones. Already, some longtime residents are moving out, said Callie Gale Heilmann, a Bridgeport resident and a founder of the advocacy group Bridgeport Generation Now.",
      "City officials seem unwilling to attach strings to force developers to incorporate affordable housing in their projects: \u201cWe do need to grow our tax base, which has remained flat for years,\u201d Ms. Heilmann said. \u201cBut we have to ask ourselves: Who is the city for? Is it for people who have lived here their whole lives?\u201d",
      "Despite Bridgeport\u2019s large population, the 15-square-mile city is small among Connecticut\u2019s municipalities. The home lots are tiny, too, making the place feel dense.",
      "But the city is mostly houses, many in the Cape Cod-style popular around World War II, when Bridgeport was humming. The Brooklawn neighborhood comprises Capes and older colonials, and Arcadia and Hughes Avenues there are part of a well-kept pocket by the Rooster River. The tall, well-maintained 1960s condo towers along upper Park Avenue are an exception; they wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Miami Beach.",
      "In the South End, aged multifamily houses sit near former factories and student housing for the University of Bridgeport. Seaside Village, a co-op with shutter-lined brick homes built during World War I for workers at munitions factories, seems ageless.",
      "Black Rock has a similar co-op, the 36-building landmark Black Rock Gardens, on Fairfield Avenue. But Tudors, Mediterranean-style and modern homes, some quite large, are more common in this set-apart area, which residents prize for its walkability, next to Long Island Sound.",
      "On the East Side, rambling Italianates in pastel hues and showy Second Empires hug the streets around Washington Park, the onetime command central for mill owners. Citywide, more than a dozen buildings or districts are on the National Register of Historic Places.",
      "Since its industrial heyday, when Hungarians, Italians, Portuguese and immigrants from many other countries poured into the factory yards, Bridgeport has been a hub for newcomers, including a surge in the 1950s of Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Today, according to census figures, the racial makeup is 42 percent Latino, 35 percent Black, 18 percent white and 5 percent Asian.",
      "In the last five years, more than 1,500 apartments have been completed, are under construction or planned, in new and converted buildings that are mostly downtown, according to the Bridgeport Building Department. A three-building complex next to Interstate 95, in a former gramophone record factory on Cherry Street and Howard Avenue that had been abandoned for decades, is completed and occupied, with 174 apartments, market-rate and affordable.",
      "At a 104-unit brick complex at Main and Golden Hill Streets, called 1188 Lofts, the lights are now on in what had been boarded-up windows. Market-rate studios there start at $1,630 a month, and one-bedrooms at $1,865.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been sort of a diamond in the rough, but we\u2019re getting discovered,\u201d said John Guedes, the president of Primrose Companies, a developer about to cut a ribbon on a former Holiday Inn at 1070 Main Street going from 267 rooms to 94 apartments. Units will come furnished with the hotel\u2019s furniture, and one-bedrooms will start at $2,500 a month.",
      "Mr. Guedes is also constructing a 92-unit building at 1269 Main, a $22 million project, and is planning to add 112 units to an office building at 855 Main. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have affordable housing in these downtowns,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause nobody will spend money at night and they will become ghost towns.\u201d",
      "In late January, there were 78 single-family homes for sale in Bridgeport, at an average list price of $510,000, according to data from Antonio Coelho, an agent with William Pitt Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.",
      "At the high end was a five-bedroom house in Black Rock listed for $1.35 million; the least expensive was a two-bedroom in foreclosure in the Hollow neighborhood, for $156,000.",
      "There were also 41 multifamily homes listed for sale, at an average price of $442,000, Mr. Coelho said. And 26 condos were available for an average of $194,000.",
      "Deal activity appears to have come back to earth after a pandemic surge, brokers say. In 2022, 666 single-family homes sold, down from 716 in 2019, according to Sotheby\u2019s, although prices remain elevated, suggesting that demand remains robust. The 2022 average sale price was $326,000 \u2014 more than 50 percent higher than 2019\u2019s average of $210,000.",
      "\u201cIn the last couple years, Bridgeport has really gone nuts,\u201d said Mr. Coelho, who emigrated from Portugal to the Hollow in 1970 when he was 12, although he lives in nearby Shelton today. \u201cIt was little rough here in the \u201970s, but there are so many positive things going on now.\u201d",
      "Although often criticized for its crime, Bridgeport\u2019s rates appear on a par with those of other comparable cities. In 2019, there were 2,506 major crimes, including assaults, robberies and car thefts, and 17 murders, according to police statistics. In 2022, by comparison, there were 1,729 major crimes, including 15 murders, suggesting that the pandemic spike has ebbed.",
      "The poverty rate is 23 percent, below New Haven\u2019s (25 percent) and Hartford\u2019s (28 percent), but higher than Stamford\u2019s (9 percent), according to the census.",
      "Frederick Law Olmsted, known as a designer of Central Park, worked his magic on two green spaces in Bridgeport: 181-acre Beardsley Park, which contains the state\u2019s only zoo, and 375-acre Seaside Park, which offers a gentle crescent of sand. A statue of P.T. Barnum, resident, mayor and circus legend, surveys the waves with a serious expression.",
      "Boldly offbeat community radio station WPKN entertains at all hours, while Fairfield Avenue in Black Rock bustles at night. In January, Park City Music Hall hosted a Van Halen tribute band and an act called Beatniks Organ Trio. Total Mortgage Arena offers hockey games and concerts, and the Amp next door \u2014 officially, the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater, a 5,700-seat conversion of a former baseball stadium \u2014 hosts bands.",
      "Steelpointe, a waterfront project planned for years, doesn\u2019t have a lot to show for itself yet, but the lighthouse-themed restaurant Boca Mediterranean Oyster Bar offers marina views.",

      "Bridgeport\u2019s school district, which had 39 schools and programs for about 19,000 students in the 2021-22 school year, has not been among the state\u2019s best, but perhaps is not as troubled as some think.",
      "On the state\u2019s 2022 Smarter Balanced assessment exams, given to students in third through eighth grade, 60.5 percent met standards in English, compared with 60.4 percent statewide, and 57 percent met standards in math, compared with 65 percent statewide. (Stamford, a nearby city with a 16,000-student district, didn\u2019t fare much differently: 57 percent of students met standards in English and 58 percent met standards in math.)",
      "Overall, 65 percent of Bridgeport\u2019s students are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, while the statewide figure is 41 percent. Bridgeport\u2019s six high schools have a four-year graduation rate of 76 percent, versus Connecticut\u2019s 90 percent overall rate.",
      "School officials say Bridgeport\u2019s system is chronically underfunded. Last year, spending there was $16,439 a student; in contrast, Stamford spent $19,625, according to state data.",
      "Bridgeport has a major stop on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven train line, from which 10 trains depart for Grand Central on weekdays between 6 and 8 a.m. The shortest trip takes an hour and 21 minutes; the longest takes an hour and 45 minutes. A monthly pass is about $384. The stop, downtown on Water Street, also offers Amtrak service.",
      "The Greater Bridgeport Transit bus system also offers service along more than a dozen routes within the city and beyond it.",
      "Bridgeport has enjoyed ferry service to Long Island since 1872, when crops were hauled to the city\u2019s factories. In the winter, boats carrying cars depart 10 times a day for Port Jefferson, a trip that takes an hour and 15 minutes. The fee for most vehicles is $68.",
      "Employees of a major pie bakery on Kossuth Street once passed the time in the parking lot by throwing empty pie tins back and forth. The pastime, at William Frisbie\u2019s bakery, soon became a hit with local children, according to the ",
      " at the Bridgeport Public Library, and the children turned it into a sport. Yalies in New Haven followed suit, calling the game \u201cFrisbie.\u201d In the 1950s, Wham-O, a California company, made plastic versions of the tins and tweaked the name slightly, producing the Frisbee.",

      "When Stephen Foglia and his fianc\u00e9e, JoAnne Crimeni, decided it was time to leave Brooklyn and put down roots, they headed south to New Jersey. Traveling through a number of areas they couldn\u2019t afford, they came upon Freehold Township, a place they knew only from having been to the mall there.",
      "\u201cRent was getting expensive, and we wanted something that was ours, not somebody else\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Foglia, 32, a carrier for the United States Postal Service. \u201cWe were still working in New York at that time, but the closer you got to the city, the more expensive it was. So we just kept heading down and decided that Freehold was where it was at.\u201d",
      "In August 2018, the couple bought a two-bedroom condominium in the Raintree development for $235,000, and two months later they married. Now they have a daughter who is nearly 2 and a second child on the way. And Mr. Foglia and Ms. Crimeni, the recreation director at the CentraState assisted living facility in Freehold, have no plans to move.",
      "\u201cWe love it here. Everything feels like what we were used to,\u201d Mr. Foglia said. \u201cIn Manalapan and Marlboro, the people are kind of flashy, but in Freehold, they\u2019re very down-to-earth.\u201d",
      "Roslyn Sibilia, an agent with ERA Central Realty Group, said clients like the Foglias, who make their way to the township from New York, typically travel south along Route 9, discovering that \u201cby the time you get to Freehold, everything seems to open up a lot more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hub, and that\u2019s what makes it desirable,\u201d said Ms. Sibilia, 52, who moved to Freehold Township from Manalapan, N.J., in 2004. \u201cWe have great park programs for parents and kids, a lot of good school choices, the mall, a major medical center. There\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d",
      "When Chris and Amy MacDougall bought their home in Freehold in 2010, Mr. MacDougall was already familiar with the township, having moved there with his family in 2000, when he was 21. Ten years later, he and his wife bought a four-bedroom 1960 colonial in East Freehold for their own growing family, paying $350,000. The MacDougalls are now very involved with their three daughters\u2019 school and sports activities: Ms. MacDougall helps with the high school yearbook, and Mr. MacDougall coaches the girls\u2019 soccer teams.",
      "A senior claims superintendent with Admiral Insurance Group, Mr. MacDougall, 44, describes the 38-square-mile township with major highways running through it as a \u201csweet spot,\u201d both geographically and demographically: \u201cSome towns are too snooty, but you don\u2019t get that facade here. In Freehold, it\u2019s real people with real jobs and real struggles. And we fit in perfectly with that.\u201d",
      "For Elizabeth Robertson, landing in Freehold was serendipitous. After 32 years of living in North Jersey, she was looking to change her life and \u201cjust threw everything up in the air\u201d in 2005. Knowing nothing about Freehold, but wanting to be near the beach \u2014 Freehold is about 18 miles west of the shore \u2014 Ms. Robertson moved first to a townhouse in East Freehold. Five years ago, she moved again, two miles south, paying $365,000 for a four-bedroom, split-level house that she shares with her daughter and two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cWhen I came here, I had no idea what kind of town this was,\u201d said Ms. Robertson, who is now 71 and retired. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve made a lot of good friends, and my grandchildren are now doing the same thing.\u201d",
      "Freehold Township is the expansive doughnut surrounding the much smaller Freehold Borough, the historic seat of Monmouth County. With shared high schools and many shared services, the township (pop. 35,367) and the borough (pop. 12,525) are frequently seen as interchangeable, although the township is more suburban, with more spacious lots and houses mostly built in the mid to late 20th century.",
      "Route 9, a major north-south highway dotted with shopping plazas and restaurants, is considered the dividing line between East Freehold, bordering Colts Neck and Marlboro, and West Freehold, bordering Howell and Jackson. East Freehold has some of the township\u2019s larger houses, most of which have access to public water and sewer systems, and is home to Poets Corner, a development with 376 townhouses and apartments. West Freehold is closer to the township\u2019s commercial activity and is home to Raintree, a gated community with more than 1,000 townhouses, condominiums and single-family houses.",
      "Naturally, both sections have their fans. \u201cPeople who live in West Freehold think it\u2019s the greatest, and those who live in East Freehold say they would never go to West,\u201d said Melissa DeSantis, 51, a broker associate with Real Broker LLC, who has made YouTube videos on both sections of the township, as well as Freehold Borough.",
      "The township also has three 55-plus adult-living communities, a mobile-home park and a sizable stock of affordable housing, including 250 units that will remain permanently affordable, said Maureen Fasano, a member of the Township Committee and a former mayor. Freehold Raceway Mall, the state\u2019s third largest mall, sits between Routes 9 and 33. CentraState Medical Center, on West Main Street, includes a 284-bed hospital, long-term care and a wellness center.",
      "The township has numerous parks as well, including a portion of the Monmouth Battlefield State Park and the Monmouth County Fairgrounds, which contribute to the more than 9,500 acres of open space. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a big commitment to green space,\u201d Ms. Fasano said, noting that the township recently increased the added tax for open space acquisitions to $0.04 per $1,000 of a home\u2019s assessed value.",
      "Freehold is considered more affordable than many of the neighboring areas. In 2022, the average sale price of a house in the township was $624,665, down slightly from 2021\u2019s average sale price of $636,276, according to the Monmouth Ocean Regional Multiple Listing Service.",
      "As of mid-February, there were 14 single-family houses on the market, along with six condominiums or townhouses and six homes in 55-plus communities. The lowest priced single-family house was a three-bedroom 1957 raised ranch house on 0.34 acres, listed for $299,900; the highest priced was a four-bedroom 2004 house on an acre, listed for $1.289 million. The lowest priced condominium or townhouse was a two-bedroom condo listed for $319,900; the highest priced was a two-bedroom townhouse listed for $427,500 (both were in the Raintree development). As for 55-plus homes, the least expensive was a two-bedroom bungalow listed for $179,900; the most expensive was a three-bedroom house in Regent Oaks, a new Toll Brothers community near Route 9, listed for $743,995.",
      "Much of the family-oriented activity takes place in Michael J. Tighe Park, a sprawling municipal park with ball fields, picnic sites, trails, a splash park and a summer park program. The 81-acre East Freehold Showgrounds is the site of numerous horse and dog shows, as well as the annual Monmouth County Fair.",
      "For indoor entertainment, residents head to the 175-acre Freehold Raceway Mall, which has an AMC movie theater and many chain stores and restaurants, or to iPlay America, a four-acre enclosed amusement park with games and rides. For evening entertainment, residents often head to Freehold Borough, with its Victorian-era Main Street lined with ethnic and upscale restaurants, or drive to nearby shoreline communities like Asbury Park or Belmar Beach.",
      "Public school students start out at one of Freehold\u2019s five elementary schools, moving on to one of two middle schools and then, depending on where they live, to Freehold Township High School, which has almost 2,000 students, or Freehold High School in Freehold Borough, which has about 1,300.",
      "As part of the Freehold Regional High School District, the township is linked to four other high schools in the area \u2014 in Manalapan, Howell, Colts Neck and Marlboro \u2014 each of which has subject-specific magnet programs to which Freehold students can apply. The Freehold Township High School\u2019s two magnet programs are in global studies and animal and botanical science; the high school in Freehold Borough has programs in culinary arts and hospitality, as well as medical sciences.",
      "In 2021-22, average SAT scores at the high school in Freehold Borough were 583 in reading and writing and 598 in math; at Freehold Township High School, they were 568 in reading and writing and 567 in math. (State averages were 557 in reading and 560 in math.)",
      "Private school options in the area include St. Rose of Lima, a Catholic school in Freehold Borough for students in prekindergarten through eighth grade, and the Peddie School, a day and boarding school in Hightstown for students in ninth through 12th grade.",
      "Many commuters catch the New Jersey Transit No. 139 bus at the Freehold Center station in Freehold Borough; the trip to Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan takes about 70 minutes and costs $16 one way or $377 for a monthly pass. Others catch the New Jersey Transit No. 67 bus at Freehold Raceway Mall and switch at Freehold Center; by that route, the trip to Port Authority takes about 90 minutes and costs $17.60 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "The closest train station is Aberdeen-Matawan, about 12 miles north. From there, the trip to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan on a direct New Jersey Transit train takes a little over an hour and costs $14.75 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "Freehold and neighboring Manalapan Township were the site of the Battle of Monmouth, one of the biggest and most important battles of the Revolutionary War. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army, led by George Washington, intercepted British troops traveling to New York City from Philadelphia in a battle that involved 26,000 soldiers and most of the major military figures of the time, including the Marquis de Lafayette, Benedict Arnold, Anthony Wayne and Alexander Hamilton. With 600 Americans killed and 700 British casualties, both sides claimed victory.",

      "Hai Yang, 37, lives in a one-bedroom apartment overlooking the Byram River in downtown Port Chester, a 2.4-square-mile village in the town of Rye, in Westchester County. Since moving to the $2,700-a-month apartment a year ago, Mr. Yang has found he can walk to most everything he needs.",
      "The Metro-North train station is a three-minute walk, which makes it easy to head into New York City to visit friends. Happy hour deals and live jazz are right next door, at the Saltaire Oyster Bar. And he doesn\u2019t need a car to hit the local gym.",
      "But Mr. Yang does have a car, so he can commute to his job in Danbury, Conn., where he is an engineering manager in the medical device industry. Finding a place to park in Port Chester is not an issue \u2014 particularly compared to his experience in downtown White Plains, N.Y., where he used to live. And the village, in general, is \u201cmuch less congested,\u201d he said.",
      "Deirdre Curran, 57, moved into a townhouse across from the village\u2019s 20-acre Lyon Park last June. A retired pet sitter and dog walker, Ms. Curran had rented in the village off and on over the years, and appreciates its diversity. \u201cThere are a lot of different cultures, and you can get any kind of food you want from Central and South America,\u201d she said.",
      "She paid $515,000 for her two-bedroom home, which is convenient to downtown businesses, major highways and the Westchester County Airport. But while Ms. Curran loves her home\u2019s location, she is increasingly alarmed by the scale and pace of residential development planned for the compact downtown area.",
      "Three large, mixed-use apartment projects are currently under construction. The six-story Tarry Lighthouse, on North Main, will have 209 apartments as well as commercial space. The Magellan, on South Main, will add another 95 apartments in a nine-story, 100-percent electrified building. And 30 Broad, across from the train station, will have 36 apartments above a microbrewery.",
      "These follow the recent completion of Port & Main, a five-story, 80-unit building a block from the train station.",
      "\u201cThey want to do all this major development in this tiny little village that does not have the infrastructure to handle it,\u201d Ms. Curran said. \u201cIt seems to me like an awful lot of major development in a very short period of time.\u201d",
      "The village has granted conditional site plan approval to projects with a total of more than 2,800 units over the past three years, said Stuart L. Rabin, the village manager. This flurry of development proposals is largely the result of a change in village zoning three years ago designed to encourage the redevelopment and revitalization of Port Chester\u2019s downtown, waterfront and transit-adjacent parcels, he said.",
      "\u201cThe village of Port Chester is certainly on the move,\u201d Mr. Rabin said.",
      "But the scale of the proposals has generated considerable public pushback, with some residents expressing concern that towering apartment buildings threaten to overwhelm the historic downtown and price out the many mom-and-pop businesses.",
      "John Allen, an elected member of Port Chester\u2019s board of trustees, said that while the village was \u201cripe for redevelopment,\u201d given the number of buildings in disrepair, there is a growing sense that the board allowed for \u201cthese extraordinary increases for density and asked for very little in return from developers,\u201d including having to meet more of the community\u2019s affordable housing needs.",
      "The board has recently begun to discuss a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d moratorium on development in order to study whether further changes are needed to the zoning code, he said. A moratorium would not affect projects already under construction.",
      "Port Chester is a densely developed village of 31,000 that \u201csprang to life at the crossroads of various transportation options,\u201d including a small harbor on Long Island Sound and rail lines into New York City, said Gregg Hamilton, a retired Manhattan transplant who runs the ",
      ".",
      "Some remnants of its 19th- and early 20th-century industrial heyday remain. The Simons Manufacturing Company building, which once housed a major textile maker, is now a loft-style office complex. And the former headquarters of the Life Savers Candy Company now houses condominiums.",
      "In the walkable downtown area, beauty salons, restaurants and grocery stores catering to the village\u2019s majority-Hispanic population line the main thoroughfares of Westchester Avenue and North and South Main. (According to census data, the village population is 64 percent Hispanic, 28 percent white, 5 percent Black and 1 percent Asian.) Two large commercial bakeries \u2014 Neri\u2019s and J.J. Cassone \u2014 are major employers.",
      "Modest single-family and multifamily homes set close to the hilly streets surround the downtown. To the north, the streets are wider, and homes are set farther apart in suburban-style neighborhoods.",
      "A 15-acre abandoned hospital campus on the edge of downtown, ",
      ", is now set for redevelopment by Rose Associates and BedRock Real Estate Partners. The companies have received site plan approval for nearly 1,000 housing units, including 200 age-restricted units, and expect to begin demolition of the existing buildings by spring, said Richard Shea, a project spokesman.",
      "The nonprofit Carver Center supports the community\u2019s lower-income and immigrant populations with a food bank, citizenship classes, after-school programming and a teen center.",
      "As in most of Westchester County, housing inventory in Port Chester is very low and it is a seller\u2019s market, said Thomas E. Consaga, the broker-owner at Re/Max Ace Realty. Competition is particularly high among first-time buyers because home prices are considerably lower than in surrounding suburbs like Greenwich, Conn., and Rye, N.Y., he said.",
      "The median sale price for a single-family home in Port Chester last year was $645,000, almost 10 percent higher than in 2021. By comparison, the 2022 ",
      " in neighboring Greenwich was almost $3 million.",
      "As of last week, there were only about 20 single-family homes on the market, Mr. Consaga said. They ranged from a three-bedroom colonial built in 1955, listed for $475,000, to a six-bedroom colonial built in 1900, listed for $1.34 million.",
      "The median sale price for a condominium last year was $347,500; for a cooperative, it was $118,000, he said.",
      "Almost 60 percent of households in Port Chester are renter-occupied, according to census data. Over the last 12 months, the median rent for a two-bedroom was $2,800, Mr. Consaga said.",
      "That figure factors in the many older, multifamily homes in the village, but rents at the new apartment buildings are considerably higher. At Port & Main, which has a rooftop terrace and a fitness center, a 400-square-foot studio starts at $2,300 a month and an 1,150-square-foot, two-bedroom rents for more than $4,000, said Whitney Okun, who runs a development group at Houlihan Lawrence that is overseeing the project.",
      "The Capitol Theater, on Westchester Avenue, books big-name artists that draw music lovers from throughout the region. Concertgoers swarm the wide array of downtown restaurants, including El Tio, Bartaco, T&J Restaurant and Pizzeria, and Panka Peruvian Bistro.",
      "The parking lot at the Waterfront at Port Chester mall is jammed on weekends with shoppers stocking up at Costco. The mall\u2019s other draw is a 14-screen AMC movie theater.",
      "The growing arts scene includes the well-established Clay Art Center, a large complex with numerous pottery studios and classrooms, as well as a public gallery, and Ice Cream Social, a relatively new space where artists working in various media can rent private or shared studios.",
      "\u201cPort Chester is my hometown, so it\u2019s kind of a dream to be able to support the artists who are here,\u201d said Jennifer Cacciola, an artist and a founder of the center, who moved to Connecticut from Brooklyn shortly before the pandemic.",
      "The Port Chester-Rye Union Free School District serves students in all of Port Chester and about a third of the neighboring village of Rye Brook. Of the roughly 4,500 students districtwide, about 83 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino, 12 percent as white, 3 percent as Black and 2 percent as Asian, according to state education data.",
      "The district contracts with Corpus Christi Holy Rosary School to provide a prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds. Students in kindergarten through fifth grade attend one of four elementary schools; those in sixth through eighth grade attend Port Chester Middle School.",
      "Port Chester High School is on a 20-acre campus bordering Rye Brook, with about 1,600 students. Academic offerings include Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses. The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2022 was 88 percent.",
      "Port Chester station, on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven line, is in the heart of downtown. The ride to Grand Central during peak commuting times takes just under an hour; the one-way fare is $13.75, and a monthly pass is $270.",

      ". As the factories closed, more immigrants from throughout Central and South America settled in the working-class village, opening restaurants and servicing the affluent suburbs as landscapers, day laborers, house cleaners and child-care providers. The population growth hasn\u2019t been without tensions: In 2009, a federal judge ordered the village to adopt a new voting system that would give the Hispanic and Latino population a fairer opportunity to elect one of their own to the board of trustees. Luis Marino, a Peruvian immigrant, was elected to the board in 2010 and is now the village\u2019s mayor.",

      " For most Americans, our home is our most valuable asset, and we realize those gains when we sell. So it\u2019s crucial to choose the salesperson wisely.",
      "Funny, then, that New York home sellers spend an average of three and a half hours researching brokers \u2014 less time than they spend searching for vacation destinations, according to a StreetEasy survey. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most critical aspects of selling, and it\u2019s even more important in a market like New York City,\u201d said Nick Smith-George, who leads the buyer and seller programs at StreetEasy.",
      "You want to find a broker who is familiar with your neighborhood, your price point and the type of building you live in. A broker who focuses on Brooklyn brownstones is probably not a good match for a condo in Harlem. So interview several agents, including ones who have sold in your building before. You want to find out how they will price your apartment, market it, stage it and sell it. They should provide you with a pricing strategy, based on comparable sales in your area.",
      "Ask to see marketing materials for other properties the broker has listed. Find them on the internet and read the listings descriptions for quality. Look at the photos and video tours. Ask if they use social media for marketing, and if they do, check out their accounts.",
      "\u201cScrutinize how someone markets apartments,\u201d said Pamela D\u2019Arc, an associate broker with Compass. \u201cLook at their website. Are the photos excellent? There is no excuse these days for not having excellent photos.\u201d",
      "Ask for references, and if the broker has sold in your building, speak with the neighbors who worked with them. Look for online references, too. You want a broker who will give you personal attention. If they are the leader of a team, will they be the person at your open house? Will they take your calls? Or will you get handed off to an associate? Ask how many listings they currently have, and how much time they will devote to yours. \u201cIt\u2019s all about a broker that makes themselves available,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Arc said.",
      "You also need to get along with the person you choose, and feel confident in the advice they give you. Or, as Sarah Saltzberg, an owner of Bohemia Realty Group in Upper Manhattan, put it: \u201cYou want to make sure you are working with someone who is listening to you, understanding you, and really advocating for you.\u201d",

      "At least, that was the plan. After striking a deal to buy the house for 1.7 million Australian dollars (about $1.1 million), they and their children \u2014 Mali, now 11, and Mark, 9 \u2014 moved in temporarily and began looking for an architect.",
      "Once they had unpacked, they noticed one big problem right away, beyond the poor insulation and the possums living in the roof: The primary living spaces in the back of the house and the backyard were dark, while the front of the house got sun all day long.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to have a lot of light, and in Australia that means a lot of northern sun,\u201d Mr. Calleja said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got street frontage on the north and want to have all your windows there, you have privacy concerns.\u201d",
      "Creating an internal courtyard was one possible solution. Searching online, the couple found ",
      ", a Melbourne-based architecture studio that had recently designed a striking courtyard house nearby.",
      "When Adi Atic and Michael Artemenko, the founders of FIGR, visited the 0.16-acre lot, they agreed that building a house with a courtyard would help. But they also thought they could do better than simply replace the old house with a new one. Looking at how the backyard was hemmed in by other houses, Mr. Artemenko said, the architects asked themselves: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we flip this on its head and do the front yard as the backyard?\u201d",
      "By pushing the new house as far back as the lot-line setback requirement would allow, they could create a more generous, light-filled yard in front. But privacy would still be an issue, and neither the owners nor their architects wanted to put up a big fence.",
      "That\u2019s when Mr. Atic and Mr. Artemenko remembered learning about the concept of a ha-ha in architecture school: a sunken fence used in 18th-century landscapes that was concealed from view. \u201cBasically, it looks like a ditch, and it prevented livestock from going in the garden area,\u201d Mr. Atic said.",
      "The architects turned this idea on its head, too: Rather than digging a ditch, they would build a landscaped earthen mound near the sidewalk, blocking sightlines from the street and creating a garden-like feeling in the yard.",
      "For the house, they designed a 2,750-square-foot, single-story structure that runs in a circle around a central courtyard and oversized glass doors that open entire walls to the outdoors. For cladding, they chose slender white brick and charred silvertop ash that run from the exterior into interior rooms, reinforcing the sense of indoor-outdoor living.",
      "Once the plans were set, the family moved into a rental down the street as demolition of the old house and construction of the new one began in July 2020. They had already ordered most of their building materials at the beginning of the pandemic, before supply-chain issues snarled other construction projects, so their new home was complete in November 2021 at a cost of about 1.5 million Australian dollars (about $990,000).",
      "The kitchen, dining area and living room are at the front of the house, taking advantage of the northern light and views of the expanded front garden. In the middle of the house are two bedrooms for the children on one side of the courtyard and a home office on the other. The primary bedroom is at the back, along with an additional sitting room and a gym; all have views of the rear garden, where the old backyard used to be.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in this property, you feel very secluded; you feel like you\u2019re in the country,\u201d Mr. Atic said. \u201cYou see greenery everywhere, even though you\u2019re five minutes from the city.\u201d",
      "The windows around the courtyard help the family stay connected. \u201cWe can see the kids from the kitchen, through the courtyard,\u201d Ms. Suemag said, so they don\u2019t need to call out to find each other. \u201cThat\u2019s probably my favorite thing.\u201d",
      "The reimagined front yard has also been embraced by the family \u2014 including their golden Labrador, Mellow, who keeps her distance from the earthen mound. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t climb the ha-ha,\u201d Mr. Calleja said. \u201cShe did once, when it was being constructed, but we arranged the boulders so she couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Much like the 18th-century ha-ha that kept farm animals where they were supposed to be, this 21st-century version has proved useful for restraining an urban pet. \u201cIt does the job,\u201d Mr. Calleja said.",

    "name": "If You Stop Mowing This May, Will Your Lawn Turn Into a Meadow?",
    "author": "By Margaret Roach",
    "publication_date": "2023-05-03T09:00:14.000Z",
    "body": [
      "It\u2019s No Mow May, time for the annual campaign that advocates just what it says: Skip mowing the lawn this month, in the name of providing additional resources for early-season pollinators.",
      "I take a slightly different approach. One day during the first week of May is the only time all year that I actually do mow several increasingly large swaths of my property.",
      "My philosophy? No Mow 364 Days, I guess you could say.",
      "I started growing my first little meadow about 30 years ago, and since then I have stopped cutting a few other areas, too, except for that one day a year.",
      "In each space, new species keep showing up. They\u2019re not all desirable, admittedly, as I have made very clear repeatedly, in rude language, to the brambles encroaching on the oldest, largest area. They fight back in their own way, their thorns drawing blood. Mine.",
      "Woody invaders and all, these wilder portions of my place have been the site of a decades-long continuing-education course in the early stages of ecological succession \u2014 and a four-season delight to me and a diversity of wildlife.",
      "I just wish I\u2019d had an operator\u2019s manual when I started. Two recently published books can provide that for gardeners who are rethinking their landscapes, by helping them maintain realistic expectations while they\u2019re transitioning to a wilder style \u2014 and facing what can sometimes feel like spontaneity incarnate.",
      "\u201cEvery lawn is a prairie screaming to come out of the ground,\u201d said Benjamin Vogt, the Nebraska-based designer who owns ",
      ", when he joined me on ",
      " not long ago to talk about his 2023 book, \u201cPrairie Up: An Introduction to Natural Garden Design.\u201d",
      "\u201cNature wants to be diverse and abundant,\u201d echoed Owen Wormser, of ",
      ", on ",
      " coinciding with the release of the updated edition of his 2020 \u201cLawns Into Meadows: Growing a Regenerative Landscape.\u201d \u201cUltimately, plants just show up.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs caretakers, we have the ability to steer this to some degree,\u201d added Mr. Wormser, who is based in Western Massachusetts. \u201cBut the idea is to also let the plants and the site and nature steer it, as well. It\u2019s a collaboration.\u201d",
      "Both books guide us through planning, site preparation and aftercare. They also stress what may be the most important lesson of all: You need to cultivate patience as intently as you cultivate your looser new patch of ground \u2014 lots of it. Just as your planting style will be more relaxed, your mind-set around tidiness, order and timing must ease up, too.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re letting plants guide the way, guide the management, show us where they want to be and how they want to be,\u201d Mr. Vogt told me. \u201cAnd even if they want to vanish completely \u2014 and that\u2019s totally OK \u2014 we like that dynamic in the landscape. We want to see things changing.\u201d",
      "As Mr. Wormser writes, \u201cPart of establishing a meadow is also a lesson in letting go. Basic maintenance aside, once you\u2019ve designed and planted your meadow, your primary job is to give it the space and time it needs to reveal its own character.\u201d",
      "I garden in a rural area, and my home landscape sits on a remnant of an orchard and pasture that were there long before I arrived. Years ago, examining a grassy area uphill from my house, I was encouraged by the presence of a few key native plants I recognized. Thinking they would make good meadow ingredients, I simply stopped mowing and watched what happened.",
      "My only mowing is timed for early May, because one plant I identified in the mix was little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), a grass that is a warm-season grower. It emerges slightly later than most of the nonnative, cool-season pasture grasses around it. By mowing after those less-desirable species have sprouted but just before the bluestem arises, I knock them back, giving it the edge.",
      "In a conventional turf-grass lawn in the suburbs, this practice that I call \u201cunmowing\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t work. A meadow-style design \u2014 or one inspired by other grassland communities like prairie or savanna \u2014 would have to be intentionally planted.",
      "Choosing plants based on their looks or your hardiness zone isn\u2019t enough, both authors stress. You must identify regionally (or even better, locally) appropriate natives that match your particular site conditions.",
      "\u201cZone 5 in New York State is not the same as Zone 5 in Colorado, particularly when working with native plants,\u201d Mr. Vogt writes. The minimum winter temperatures may be similar, but the climates and plant communities are not.",
      "Rather than using the Department of Agriculture\u2019s hardiness zone maps, he starts with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ",
      ", to learn more about the greater ecosystem a property lies within.",
      "Next, he turns to native-plant search tools and guides on websites like ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " or ",
      " that offer lists of regional natives. Not all of them will be suited to your design concept, precise location or site conditions, though, so that\u2019s when the homework really begins.",
      "Narrow the possibilities by reading up on each plant, Mr. Vogt advised. A regional field guide to natives is another good tool. Your state or local native-plant society will have valuable resources to explore, too.",
      "Maybe no plant choices are more important than which grasses to use.",
      "\u201cSince grasses ground a meadow visually and are the dominant plants, choose them first,\u201d Mr. Wormser writes. He typically incorporates one or two clump-forming, warm-season grasses into a small-scale design (or up to four in a large project), which form \u201cthe backbone of my meadows.\u201d",
      "Another consideration in refining your palette: To create nature-inspired designs, Mr. Vogt suggests thinking in layers, the way nature\u2019s plant communities are structured. That means employing plants of various scales, from ground covers like sedges (Carex) and structural ones that fill the middle level, like mountain mint (Pycnanthemum virginianum), to taller, architectural types, like ironweed (Vernonia).",
      "He also recommends selecting for layers of seasonality \u2014 striving for continued visual appeal and sustained support for beneficial insects, birds and other wildlife.",
      "\u201cA natural garden has several plants at each layer,\u201d he writes, \u201cas well as plants doing their thing at different times of year.\u201d",
      "So far, my own \u201cbed preparation\u201d in each experiment has been nothing more than deciding what shape to leave unmown. But most gardeners will need to prepare their sites for planting, and both books lay out the options.",
      "A site that has been cleared of vegetation is usually the ideal starting point, they agree. But how best to get there: with repeated tillings over many months or an application of ",
      "? Or perhaps via the seemingly instant gratification of a rented sod stripper\u2019s mechanical handiwork? Or maybe you could use cardboard to ",
      " the underlying vegetation with plastic sheeting?",
      "There are ethical considerations \u2014 and practical ones. For instance, although stripping the sod allows you to plant the same day, the weed seeds in the underlying soil will germinate once they have been exposed to light. A late-summer or early-fall herbicide application may go against the organic gardener\u2019s grain, but the dead lawn that results makes a good base to sow seed into, without the tilling that could uncover those weed seeds.",
      "Whether to sow seed, plant landscape plugs or use a mixture of both is another decision that has to be made. Cost is a factor, and so is time \u2014 and time may be the biggest point of reckoning.",
      "A completely seed-sown meadow can take four or more years to come together, Mr. Vogt said. If you\u2019re using all plugs, it takes two to three years; with a mixture of the two, it takes about four.",
      "In the meantime, a nurse crop \u2014 often an annual grass like rye or other annuals \u201cfor first-year green and color,\u201d he writes \u2014 can help visually, and will limit weeds while the seed-sown perennials take hold. But it won\u2019t be the \u201cafter\u201d picture you had in mind. Not yet.",
      "That\u2019s why he has his clients sign what he calls \u201can expectations agreement\u201d before beginning a project: He wants them to acknowledge that some growing pains lie ahead, and that there is no point of fixity when it will be \u201call done.\u201d",
      "Change has surely been the one constant in my meadow experience. I now count five species of goldenrod (Solidago) \u2014 where did they all come from? What about the invasion of weeds, including that thorny Rubus? Do I pull or dig them up, risking soil disturbance that might unearth who knows what? My once-yearly mowing no longer subdues the brambles as it did years ago.",
      "\u201cA lot of this is experimentation, and really just seeing what happens,\u201d Mr. Wormser told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re skeptical about something like pulling blackberries, maybe just pull one and see what happens in a month or two.\u201d",
      "What is most reassuring about these new guidebooks is that neither author, despite his considerable depth of experience, pretends to have all the answers. Bigger forces are at work, as anyone ready to skip mowing 364 days a year will come to understand. This is a different kind of gardening.",
      "\u201cYou can plan for every contingency with your site prep and design,\u201d Mr. Wormser writes, \u201cbut nature will have the last word.\u201d",

      "Since the days of the gold rush, dreamers hoping to strike it rich have been staking their claim to a dusty 80-acre town in the Mojave Desert called Nipton. For nearly all of them, those dreams have been fool\u2019s gold.",
      "A buyer who envisioned turning the California ghost town into a testing ground for solar power died before getting his green energy idea off the ground. An attempt by a cannabis company to create a weed-themed resort was impeded by legislation that banned marijuana sales there.",
      "Ross Mollison is the most recent badlands baron. His company, Spiegelworld, bought the town on a whim last year for $2.5 million \u2014 a million or so shy of what he paid for his six-bed, five-bath apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn.",
      "As the founder of Spiegelworld, a live entertainment company producing sybaritic adult circuses in Las Vegas, Mr. Mollison specializes in spectacle and calls himself an \u201cImpresario Extraordinaire.\u201d But even hedonists must occasionally fast. In the desert sun of Nipton, where visitors now can find little beyond a peeling one-room schoolhouse, an empty general store, a five-bed hotel and a small cluster of forgotten cabins, he is trying to build an oasis of escape \u2014 a circus sanctuary.",
      "This unincorporated town, with no local government and a penchant for attracting homesteaders who prefer to stay off the grid, can become a retreat for circus performers to workshop new acts and a luxury attraction for tourists who could stop there on the way to Las Vegas, Mr. Mollison said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not approaching it like a developer. I want Nipton to look like it does now, but more beautified, with a globally significant, interesting restaurant that is somewhere between Francis Mallmann and the French Laundry,\u201d he said, referencing well-known restaurateurs as he described plans for multiple eateries, a hotel, solar panels and a runway for small planes, all with a big top twist. \u201cMaybe we stick a trapeze in the middle, or a high wire that\u2019s 1,000 feet off the ground. Or is that too P.T. Barnum?\u201d",
      "The resurrection plan has not gone unnoticed by the town\u2019s handful of locals, who have watched men like Mr. Mollison come and go. Like his circus attractions, Mr. Mollison is a bit of a curiosity. He has a fondness for foul language, especially the word that begins with the letter F. He is unabashed about his taste for the refined, and his distaste for the conventional. His employees say he pushes them to constantly go weirder and wilder in their thinking, and is often willing to make huge investments of both time and money to see how that thinking plays out.",
      "\u201cMy first week on the job, we had coffee, and he said, \u2018Look, I want to hear every stupid idea you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d said David Anthony, general manager of \u201cAtomic Saloon Show,\u201d a Spiegelworld production at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. \u201cOf all the people I know who would have bought a town, Ross makes sense.\u201d",
      "Mr. Mollison grew up in Melbourne, Australia, and Nipton\u2019s topography \u2014 studded with eucalyptus, a tree mostly native to the Land Down Under \u2014 reminds him of home. \u201cIt smells like Australia,\u201d he said.",
      "Perhaps the man is meeting the town. There is only one paved road, and little aside from sand, shrubs and cholla cactuses for miles. The Union Pacific railroad train regularly barrels down the tracks that border the town, its whistle splitting the air. The nearest hospital is an hour away; to send or pick up mail, residents must drive to post office boxes across the Nevada border. Without taxation for city management services, fire and police support, while technically available from other nearby towns in San Bernardino county, can be spotty.",
      "It takes a certain kind of person to live so remotely. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small town,\u201d said Alex Strebel, who along with her husband, Frank, was tapped as Nipton\u2019s caretaker shortly after Spiegelworld\u2019s purchase. \u201cIf you sneeze when you\u2019re driving by, you\u2019re going to miss it.\u201d",
      "Nipton currently has fewer than two dozen residents, primarily clustered in a small RV park. Most are seasonal miners who stay for a few months at a time and keep to themselves; others, like Jim Eslinger, have lived there since 2009 and are offering themselves as informal partners to Spiegelworld.",
      "\u201cThis is my idea of paradise out here,\u201d said Mr. Eslinger, 66, a former long-haul trucker who grew up in Washington State and came to Nipton in 2009 after 18 years on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s like Hotel California \u2014 I checked in and I never plan to leave.\u201d",
      "He refers to himself as Nipton\u2019s Mayor Jim. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see what Spiegelworld has in store, and to help them make their dreams come true. I don\u2019t care, I just enjoy living out here.\u201d",
      "Nathan Will, 30, an industrial construction worker from Plain City, Ohio, came to Nipton last January to take a job at the nearby rare earth mineral mines. His wife and 1.5-year-old son are waiting for him back home, and nights in his camper with his two dogs, Max and Honey, can be quiet.",
      "When Spiegelworld first took over, he wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.",
      "\u201cAt first, I was just thinking, what does a circus want with an old town in the middle of nowhere?\u201d Mr. Will said. \u201cThe first time they brought all the performers out here, in their outfits and costumes, it was a culture shock. But it\u2019s gotten cleaner and more dependable, and you have someone here if something goes wrong.\u201d",
      "Mr. Mollison said he has made it a priority to include the local residents in his plans for Nipton, and in a smattering of small events that Spiegelworld has held on the grounds so far, he has made sure to invite them.",
      "In late February, Mr. Mollison decided to give a party in Nipton. Two dozen Spiegelworld performers and employees drove in from Las Vegas. And as they gathered in Nipton\u2019s abandoned saloon for a festive sukiyaki dinner, inspired by a hot pot soup Mr. Mollison had recently enjoyed in Japan, Mr. Will and Mr. Eslinger were guests at the table.",
      "\u201cMy biggest hope for Nipton is you don\u2019t forget what makes us special,\u201d Mr. Will said, raising a beer in a toast while everyone else sipped sake cocktails. \u201cFamily comes from a lot of places other than blood, so if Nipton keeps this, sticking together with the people, it will thrive.\u201d",
      "First a gold rush outpost in the early 1900s, Nipton later served as a bolt-hole for silent film stars looking for a respite from Hollywood, and even the setting for a postapocalyptic video game. But after the gold rush stalled and the mining industry declined, Nipton\u2019s appeal, rooted largely in having a general store and a rail station, faded. The boomtown went bust by the middle of the 20th century.",
      "Nipton\u2019s latest chapter begins in the 1980s, when Gerald Freeman, a gold miner eager to make the shift to renewable energy, purchased the town. After decades of disuse, it was largely abandoned. He fixed up its store and cafe into an old-timey destination for tourists seeking a taste of the American West and ",
      " amid the yucca and gum trees.",
      "But he was only about halfway to that goal when he died in 2016. His wife, Roxanne Lang, then sold Nipton for $5 million to American Green, a cannabis company with plans to turn the town into a weed-themed resort geared toward Instagram marijuana influencers. But after only a year, American Green sold Nipton to a subsidiary, who ended up defaulting in payments. Ms. Lang forced a foreclosure and put the town back on the market. In 2021, Mr. Mollison stepped forward.",
      "Mr. Mollison, who signed a $75 million deal with Caesar\u2019s Entertainment in 2021 and reportedly dropped $30 million just on the artwork for his Las Vegas restaurant Superfrico, brings an immense amount of muscle to a town long accustomed to fending for itself.",
      "In every Spiegelworld production \u2014 there are currently four on the Las Vegas Strip, with two more in the works, and two headed soon for Atlantic City \u2014 he is notoriously detail oriented, furiously sweating the small stuff. He\u2019s just as hands-on in Nipton, where on a recent visit he was found jumping excitedly inside a recently converted Spartan Imperial Mansion trailer to review the craftsmanship and map out precisely where future overnight guests would sit and sleep.",
      "Alex and Frank Strebel are production managers, the back-of-house crew who keep theater performances running behind the scenes. They met Mr. Mollison three years ago when he hired them to build props for OPM, Spiegelworld\u2019s space-age themed variety show at The Cosmopolitan hotel. Mr. Mollison liked their handiwork, and he also liked their lifestyle: The couple, both 35, met at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and were living largely off the land of their home in Pahrump, Nev., a town of 40,000 straddling the California border.",
      "They had what it takes, he felt, to turn Nipton around.",
      "\u201cWe rolled up our sleeves and fired up the tractor,\u201d Mr. Strebel said. \u201cOur contractors are two hours away, but we have experience in doing things locally since we built our own house.\u201d",
      "The couple have been living full-time in Nipton since last May, sharing a camper van with their five chickens and two dogs and performing cleanup work that includes repairing septic systems and fixing electric lines.",
      "They\u2019ve also hauled out trash \u2014 a lot of it. At only 80 acres, Nipton has one real road and a smaller footprint than the Mall of America. But Mr. and Ms. Strebel found rotting mattresses, pieces of an old stagecoach, a clogged septic tank and 300 tons of assorted junk when they arrived. After months of cleanup by both tractor and golf cart, they\u2019re now focusing on low-water landscaping and rehabbing the funky public art and rusting aluminum trailers left behind by previous owners.",
      "They\u2019ve taken care to preserve some of the town\u2019s wackier art pieces, including Fly By, a 24-foot-high glass manta ray by Peter Hazel, and Perpetual Consumption, a 26-foot-high sculpture by Clayton Blake in which stacked shopping carts form loop-the-loops meant to symbolize American consumerism. That piece was originally created for Burning Man and brought to Nipton in 2018 by American Green.",
      "Next on the docket is the repurposing of the town\u2019s vacant general store, which was once a destination for Nevada drivers looking to purchase California lottery tickets (thanks to its powerful casino industry, the lottery is prohibited in Nevada), as well as its saloon, where Mr. Mollison threw his dinner party in February.",
      "The town has several one-room cabins that also lack plumbing and are heated in the cold desert nights by freestanding potbellied stoves. Mr. Mollison plans to move those to the other side of Nipton\u2019s main road and allow his performers to individually design and outfit them. The result will be an artist\u2019s village, tentatively named Spiegelville, where performers can stay when coming to Nipton to workshop performances. For tourists, tricked-out aluminum trailers and a planned luxury hotel will, he says, offer plusher accommodations.",
      "Gypsy Wood, an Australian burlesque dancer who performs in OPM, arrived at the February dinner party in her red convertible with her dog Marcello. Like many of Spiegelworld\u2019s artists, circus life was handed down to her by her parents, who were traveling performers in her hometown Adelaide, Australia.",
      "Gypsy is her given name \u2014 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have chosen this as my stage name. I would have chosen something else, like Annabella,\u201d she said \u2014 and she said she is counting the days until the dream of Spiegelville is a reality.",
      "\u201cCircus life is like being on a bus trip that you can\u2019t get off. Vegas is so seductive in that way. But you can\u2019t leave, and there are like three coffee shops so you see everyone all the time. Nipton might be an escape from the drama,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will help you get yourself together.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s certainly been the case for Niko Novick, who has been living in one of those toiletless cabins since last July. Mr. Novick, 32, who refers to himself as Spiegelworld\u2019s \u201ccocktail clown,\u201d runs the beverage program for the company, designing for the multiple bars at each of the company\u2019s three shows, as well as ",
      ", their twisted, debaucherous take on dinner theater where Italian dishes are served with a side of strippers, acrobats and raunchy comedy.",
      "He has a house in Los Angeles, three hours away by car, but prefers to be at Nipton with the company of Mala, his 13-year-old dog. He uses an outdoor shower and restroom, or pops into one of the two bathrooms at the town\u2019s tiny Hotel California, where the actress Clara Bow often stayed in the 1920s. Today, its five bedrooms serve as guest quarters for friends of Spiegelworld who stay the night.",
      "\u201cDeep down, I love solitude,\u201d he said. \u201cComing here allows me to recharge. And that\u2019s when creativity is most rampant.\u201d",
      "Mr. Mollison is committed to fostering that creativity, so much so that he estimates he\u2019ll spend around $20 million to make his dreams for Nipton come true. But he isn\u2019t rushing the process. \u201cPeople come to Las Vegas, and dinner theater is like, someone pretending to be Frank Sinatra and you\u2019ve got to sit there for 30 minutes waiting for it to end,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about this place is that it\u2019s a surprise, and it\u2019s different from what\u2019s out there. We\u2019re in no hurry.\"",
      "A few hours before the dinner party was set to begin, Mr. Mollison got into his Cirrus airplane and flew over the town, grinning while surveying his purchase from the sky.",
      "He wasn\u2019t thinking about the town\u2019s history of failed endeavors. He was only thinking about his delight in planning its future.",
      "\u201cI want Nipton to be growing as long as we have great ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so excited about this idea. It\u2019s just so much fun.\u201d",

Only four of the 50 neighborhoods had a median sale price of $2 million or more, compared with eight in the first quarter of 2022.",

Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn \u2014 a former industrial area now sprouting riverfront high-rises \u2014 was the third-most expensive neighborhood.

      "In the first Bronx neighborhood to appear among the top 50, Fieldston, the median sale price soared 149 percent year-over-year, to $840,000. The change reflected the fact that in 2023, 54 percent of sales there were of single-family homes (generally more expensive), up from just 7 percent a year earlier. Eight Queens neighborhoods were among the 50 most expensive, while Brooklyn claimed 22 spots and Manhattan 24.

      "The fully renovated, eco-friendly brick house is six stories high and 18 feet wide and is currently configured with two units, according to StreetEasy. There are a total of eight bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, plus a rear garden and a small front yard."

      "In 1991, Frances Anderton was a young journalist newly arrived in Los Angeles, when she parked herself in a one-bedroom unit in a building codesigned by Frank Gehry. The 1960s stucco apartment house in Santa Monica had an overhanging red roof and wide, wooden balconies, something like a cross between a bungalow motel and a Japanese minka. Early in his career, Mr. Gehry lived there with his family. At one time or another, so did his sister, his psychoanalyst and the artist Judy Chicago.",
      "Ms. Anderton, who grew up in England, became a longtime producer and host of radio programs about design and architecture for KCRW in Los Angeles. But she skipped the itchy, transitory habits of many Americans, for whom a first apartment is a gateway to a single-family house.",
      "In the course of dating Robin Bennett Stein, a musician and writer she ultimately married, she made room for him in her apartment. After the couple had a daughter, they traded up to a two-bedroom in the same building (the unit that once belonged to Mr. Gehry\u2019s analyst).",
      "And there they remain. \u201cDuring the years I lived by myself, I felt safe, tucked between neighbors; later, our only child grew up in a building where she never felt alone,\u201d Ms. Anderton writes in her recent book, a paean to community living called \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "In \u201cCommon Ground,\u201d Ms. Anderton, 60, makes the point that while Los Angeles may seem like a sprawling breeding ground of American dream houses set in gardens, it has an equally compelling history of shared real estate that continues to this day.",
      "Perpetual sunshine has allowed the city\u2019s multifamily housing to be opened to courtyards and parks and festooned with exterior staircases and balconies, breaking the stolid blocks of traditional apartment houses and fostering social connections. And while most of these buildings\u2019 forms and arrangements have been transplanted from other regions \u2014 like Angelenos themselves \u2014 they bear the creative claw marks of the architects who came to Southern California to test their imaginations: health-seeking humanists like Irving Gill, radical modernists like Rudolph Schindler and form-manipulating mavericks like Mr. Gehry.",
      "As contemporary architects and developers work to relieve Los Angeles of its vicious housing scarcity \u2014 almost 42,000 people in the city are currently unhoused \u2014 \u201cCommon Ground\u201d shows examples of affordable multifamily buildings that look like anything but.",
      "Real estate development is never a walk in the park, but because some relief from the city\u2019s draconian restrictions is granted to creators of affordable housing, this area has attracted design innovators working with progressive developers who are committed to righting decades of inequities created by exclusionary housing policies. For this reason, many of the projects that \u201cCommon Ground\u201d highlights make the most out of the least: those with oddly shaped lots, peripheral locations and components produced in factories.",
      "One example: MLK1101, a 26-unit, mixed-use complex for formerly homeless veterans and low-income families, which delivers sunlight, greenery and a balance of communal and private space without sacrificing feelings of security. Designed by Lorcan O\u2019Herlihy with the nonprofit development agency Clifford Beers Housing (now Holos Communities), and completed in 2019, the energy-efficient building has a green roof that swoops to the ground at its entrance \u2014 a gesture, one ",
      " pointed out, that may be familiar in ",
      " but is rarely seen in affordable housing.",
      "\u201cOur job is to produce solutions, not just objects,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Herlihy said. Which is not to diminish the importance of curb appeal. By designing attractive buildings that dignify a block, he helps stave off the resistance of neighbors.",
      "Mr. O\u2019Herlihy works to give access to green space however he can find it. In the case of Formosa 1140, an 11-unit, market-rate condominium built in 2009 in West Hollywood, the project\u2019s economics did not allow for a central courtyard, so his developer partners negotiated with the city to lease a piece of the lot as a pocket park that could be enjoyed by both residents and the public.",
      "Currently, his office is completing Isla Intersections, an affordable housing complex on a wedge-shaped median between two roads in South Los Angeles. From this unpromising site have risen stacks of factory-built steel modules punctuated by little green spaces. Each of the 57 modules is a one-bedroom unit, and one of the bordering streets is being turned into a paseo \u2014 a public pedestrian thoroughfare with landscaping that will help clean the air.",
      "Squeezing not just housing but an entirely new building type from the margins is an achievement \u201cCommon Ground\u201d highlights in its discussion of One Santa Fe. Described by Ms. Anderton as \u201ca skyscraper laid on its side,\u201d the three-block-long building, which opened in 2011, combines 438 apartments, 20 percent of them affordable, with shops, restaurants, a bookstore and multiple communal areas, including a pool deck.",
      "The surroundings and air quality are not exactly pastoral, given that One Santa Fe runs alongside Metro rail tracks in the city\u2019s newly developed arts district. \u201cThere was very little there,\u201d the architect, Michael Maltzan, recently recalled. \u201cYou would see tumbleweeds blow across the street. I\u2019m not making that up.\u201d",
      "There were no real precedents in Los Angeles for the building\u2019s scale and high level of mixed use, he noted. Facing down criticism that the size would overwhelm the neighborhood, he looked ahead, trying to envision how the city would evolve around it. For instance, One Santa Fe was designed to provide access to an anticipated Metro Red Line station. If that emerges, the complex \u2014 most of which floats like a bridge over the street level \u2014 will turn into a gateway between transit and the city.",
      "The building has attracted a hybrid group of residents of various ages and income levels, offering \u201can alternative to the binary housing split in Los Angeles \u2014 apartments for the poor or young and old people without children, and houses for well-to-do families,\u201d Ms. Anderton writes. And it has proved to be a bellwether for similar bulked-up developments in other neighborhoods.",
      "Larry Scarpa, a partner in the architecture firm Brooks + Scarpa, said he believes the future of housing in Los Angeles lies in combining affordable and market-rate units under a single roof. His firm recently completed a mixed-use development called 11NOHO that took advantage of a California state bill allowing for increased height and density in buildings with affordable units (12 out of 60, in this case). The building is on the edge of an emerging arts district in North Hollywood with \u201ca lot of restaurants and shops that need service industry workers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should they drive from Palmdale,\u201d a city more than 50 miles away?",
      "The design, a variant of the courtyard apartment style identified with Los Angeles for more than a century, is characteristic of two earlier Brooks+Scarpa projects featured in \u201cCommon Ground\u201d: The Six, a 2017 supportive housing building for disabled veterans, and the Rose Apartments, a 2022 mixed-use complex for young adults who have aged out of child-welfare facilities and foster homes. These buildings all wrap around communal outdoor spaces that connect visually to the street, but offer the feeling of light-filled sanctuaries.",
      "Ms. Anderton said she was motivated to cheerlead for multifamily housing when her daughter, who was in high school, complained of feeling stigmatized by living so differently from her friends in single-family houses.",
      "But when she embarked on her book, she recalled, \u201cPeople would say, \u2018Frances, you\u2019ve got to remember people so desperately want to own a home.\u2019\u201d",
      "She was reminded of the racial history that carpeted Los Angeles with single-family zoning, providing financial assets for white families and driving renters of color to the margins.",
      "\u201cAll absolutely true,\u201d Ms. Anderton said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that this other story isn\u2019t true, too. We really have to treasure our multifamily housing history.\u201d",

      "After the first time Anna Beagley saw gray floors, she couldn\u2019t get them out of her mind. \u201cIt was love at first sight,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a nice, neutral color but still give the room a light, airy vibe.\u201d",
      "She hasn\u2019t looked back since 2021 when she renovated her home in Utah and installed the vinyl gray flooring. \u201cI can add touches of any color I want without really worrying if it will clash,\u201d said Ms. Beagley, 34, an analyst.",
      "But she began to notice an impassioned discourse about dust-colored floors take place online. Tastemakers have drawn a line, and it\u2019s black and white: You either adore them or despise them. ",
      "Gray floors have been a source of vitriol for many people, who\u2019ve expressed their distaste on social media with posts that have frequently gone viral. One user tweeted, \u201cEvery time original hardwood floors are replaced by gray plank vinyl a year is taken from my life.\u201d Another ",
      " them \u201cAirBnbcore.\u201d In an Instagram ",
      " that has garnered nearly 170,000 likes, designer ",
      " said that gray flooring \u201csucks the life out of any space that you have.\u201d",
      "At times, all the hatred directed at gray flooring can feel tiresome, Ms. Beagley said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s laughable. They\u2019re floors, people. It\u2019s not life or death,\u201d she said. \u201cOther times I get a little frustrated, if you don\u2019t like them don\u2019t get them, but why does anyone feel the need to loudly proclaim their hate for them?\u201d",
      "In the past few years, gray flooring has become a default option among many developers. Designers and architects think the vast grayness is a result of the past decade\u2019s dominating minimalist aesthetic, as well as developers viewing it as a safe and inoffensive option. Gray flooring in apartments is also often laminate \u2014 a synthetic material that gives the appearance of wood and is cheaper than real hardwood flooring.",
      "In 2021, \u201cUltimate Gray\u201d was a ",
      ". Now, as interiors have become inundated with grayness and people closely associate the color with corporate neutrality, some designers are starting to notice clients\u2019 tastes shift away from the ashen, the smoky and the silvery.",
      "\u201cGray flooring is the most common type of flooring we use in our multifamily apartment projects,\u201d said Olga Cotofana, the senior director of design at the real estate development company ",
      ". The company\u2019s buildings with gray floors include a high-rise in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which opened in 2020, and an apartment complex in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, which is set to open later this year. \u201cGray flooring works well in new construction real estate developments because it appeals to the masses and works well with a variety of interior design and architectural elements on trend currently,\u201d Ms. Cotofana said.",
      "Lowe\u2019s has seen an uptick in sales for gray wood, vinyl and tile, said Dean Schwartz, the company\u2019s senior vice president of merchandising. \u201cParallel to an increase in consumer demand for a cool, modern aesthetic, we have seen sales of gray floor shades increase in recent years,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz.",
      "\u201cThey are nonconfrontational,\u201d said Demetrios A. Comodromos, a co-founder of the architecture firm ",
      ". \u201cThe desaturated approach also speaks to millennial color sensibilities, like Pepto-Bismol pink, pale yellows and other desaturated colors that have been the fad in recent years.\u201d",
      "For Audra Williams, 47, it\u2019s what the gray floors symbolize that sparks irritation. Ms. Williams lives in a rural part of the Canadian province Nova Scotia, where many homes have been bought by investors and converted into rentals. She saw one particular apartment continue to show up on Facebook Marketplace, and it had gray floors.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s just layers of lack of care or concern for anybody who will be living in that building,\u201d said Ms. Williams, a freelance communications consultant. \u201cPeople just feel really powerless. So many people who are renting right now cannot find anything other than this super gray, bleak, pretty cheap flooring. People tend to choose it for other people more than they choose it for themselves.\u201d",
      "Diana Viera, a managing partner at the design firm Italkraft, said that she first started to notice gray flooring taking off in the United States after its ",
      " design fairs in Milan in the 2010s. \u201cTypically, whatever the new design is in Italy, it starts trickling into the U.S.,\u201d she said.",
      "What comes next is a tale perhaps best summed up by Miranda Priestly, the fictional fashion editor played by Meryl Streep, in \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d explaining to her assistant how trends can flow from high fashion brands to casual wear. After some luxury designers debuted cerulean garments in their collections, she said, \u201cThen it filtered down through the department stores, and then trickled on down into some tragic casual corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s likely the story with gray floors. And because flooring can range from expensive options (like, natural stone or hardwood) to lower-end (such as laminate), the gray color trend could be applied to most types of homes, including McMansions in gated communities, luxury condominiums and older homes being flipped.",
      "\u201cBecause you have these huge price differences in materials, it allows you to market so that everybody\u2019s doing it,\u201d said Ms. Viera.",
      "But now that gray flooring is omnipresent and isn\u2019t something intentional or seemingly new anymore, people don\u2019t want it so badly, Ms. Viera said.",
      "Among wealthy homeowners, a shift away from gray is already in motion. \u201cIn high-end, luxury residential homes that are very custom, those are the first people to start going in a different direction because they can afford something different,\u201d said Ms. Viera. Those clients of hers are moving toward the extremes, either black floors or very light, sand tones, she added.",
      "However, many people don\u2019t have the luxury and extra income necessary to decide against a housing unit simply because it has gray floors. ",
      " Luci\u0301a Massucco, a 28-year-old artist, is no fan of the flooring. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have a warm, cozy ambience with them,\u201d said Ms. Massucco. \u201cThey have a very soul-deprived and clinical feeling.\u201d",
      "But last year when she was apartment hunting in Vancouver, British Columbia, Ms. Massucco found it difficult to find an up-to-date apartment that didn\u2019t have gray floors. Any option with other types of flooring, she found, were either luxury units way out of her budget or old and rundown. Deciding against going broke for a matter of aesthetics or risking living with bedbugs, she went for a one-bedroom apartment lined with light-gray planks.",
      "Feeling stuck with the gray flooring has led to all the backlash online.",
      "Social media gives a platform for people\u2019s tastes to be spread and distaste to turn viral \u2014 being a hater can lead to likes and followers. ",
      "Floors are subject to the same fast-spinning trend cycle that has already come for ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " or ",
      ". The internet doesn\u2019t help slow things down either, making the hottest trend look all the more elusive, appearing and disappearing so fast that most people can\u2019t keep up.",
      "And in a few years \u2014 or sometimes even sooner \u2014 people begin to hate them.\u00a0For example, parquet floors \u2014 in which wood slats are arranged in repeating, geometric patterns \u2014 were once all the rage in the 1960s and \u201970s in New York. Today, clients are turned off by them, said Keyan Sanai, an agent at Douglas Elliman in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have to hide now,\u201d he said.",
      "And while he\u2019s heard the complaints about gray flooring lately, Mr. Sanai said that sometimes it\u2019s preferable among clients because it means that the apartment has been recently updated, even if it isn\u2019t the most thoughtfully designed. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky enough to have floors that aren\u2019t from 100 years ago in a New York City apartment, I think that\u2019s exciting as is,\u201d he said.",
      "Claire Lower, a 36-year-old editor at Lifehacker, a blog for life hacks, bought her Portland, Ore., home, which came with gray floors, in 2020. She called the floors \u201csoulless\u201d and \u201ccorporate neutral,\u201d but noted that they were, at least, easy to clean. \u201cThey\u2019re functional. There\u2019s nothing wrong with them, so they\u2019re not a priority to be redone,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, Ms. Beagley is in love with her gray floors. \u201cWhen I found gray floors, I was just absolutely over the moon,\u201d she said. \u201cI can add touches of any color I want without really worrying if it will clash.\u201d"

      "Although the judge had steeled himself for a grueling fight, the cannabis case was over in mere minutes.",
      "The defendant had been caught in his parents\u2019 house with 7.5 ounces of marijuana, and the judge was getting ready for the prosecution to try him as an adult since he was just 18, and technically could be held responsible under the adult laws.",
      "But the district attorney said he planned to try the case under Germany\u2019s youth laws.",
      "That gave Judge Andreas M\u00fcller an opening. Presiding over the courtroom in the traditional black robe and white tie, he immediately threw out the case, citing a youth court statute that encourages rehabilitation rather than punishment.",
      "\u201cMaybe one day, when you\u2019ve had the chance to learn to become an able businessman, you can become a cannabis entrepreneur,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller told the defendant, eliciting chuckles in the courtroom in\u00a0Bernau bei Berlin, a small, picturesque community north of the German capital. The defendant, Justin H., whose surname is protected by Germany\u2019s strict privacy laws, was too stunned to react other than to nod.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller is famous in Germany for his relentless criticism of the law criminalizing cannabis possession. Often with obvious anger in his voice, he has\u00a0argued against Germany\u2019s cannabis law in numerous TV discussion panels; at pro-cannabis demonstrations; in a book; and even in a ",
      ", all while serving as an active judge. In his courtroom, where he hears mainly youth but also adult cases, he has repeatedly thrown out minor possession cases.",
      "\u201cIt makes me so mad to see so many young people locked up and criminalized just because they use cannabis and not alcohol,\u201d he said during a cigarette break at Bernau\u2019s busy municipal court.",
      "Part of his anger arises both from the frequency of cannabis arrests \u2014 181,000 on minor possession or use charges in 2021 \u2014 and the billions of euros spent enforcing what he said was the \u201cabsurd\u201d law against getting high.",
      "In 2020, Judge M\u00fcller wrote the first complaint to Germany\u2019s highest constitutional court, asking it to overturn the cannabis law. Other judges followed, and the court is now reviewing 10 drug cases sent by three different courts in Germany.",
      "\u201cFor young people like us, it\u2019s pretty inspiring to have someone from an older generation, who is a judge, advocate for a thing that maybe goes against conventional opinion,\u201d said the rapper GReeeN, 33, who often sings favorably about cannabis. \u201cIt\u2019s important \u2014 we need people like him for change.\u201d",
      "GReeeN, whose real name is Pasquale Denefleh, knows the judge from a video they made together. The judge, playing himself, raps about the evils of cannabis prohibition. \u201cSmoking weed is not criminal; smoking weed is normal,\u201d he sings.",
      "The German government has begun taking the judge\u2019s side in the cannabis debate just as the judge, 61, is preparing to retire from the bench.",
      "In mid-April, Karl Lauterbach, the country\u2019s health minister, presented a plan legalizing cannabis for personal use; in the coming months, a more comprehensive plan that would eventually legalize and tax the sale of cannabis is expected to be proposed.",
      "After years of a conservative-run government, the new center-left coalition under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, has signaled it is likely to approve the proposal, which would make Germany the first European country where not only the possession but also the public sale of cannabis is not just decriminalized, but legalized.",
      "Although the changes to the law would have come without his help, Judge M\u00fcller and others believe he played a small part in the overhaul.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that he was instrumental in showing that demands for reform were not just coming from the cannabis community, but from a more established perspective, too,\u201d said Ates G\u00fcrpinar, a member of Parliament and the drug policy spokesman for the far-left Die Linke party, which supports legalizing cannabis.",
      "Before the coalition\u2019s latest plan was announced, Judge M\u00fcller had threatened to organize street protests to put pressure on the government.",
      "That pugnaciousness is a signature part of the judge\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cBecause of his rough edges, he\u2019s not just well-known, he\u2019s also feared,\u201d Mr. G\u00fcrpinar said. \u201cHe will just fire off things even if he knows that it could irritate potential allies.\u201d",
      "Judges in Germany wield a lot of power in their courtrooms, but with a few exceptions \u2014 like a judge ",
      " last December \u2014 they tend to stay out of the political fray.",
      "Not so Judge M\u00fcller, who regularly gets into spats on Twitter, where he has 60,000 followers. He also is the deputy director of the German chapter of LEAP, or Law Enforcement Action Partnership, a cannabis advocacy group run by law-enforcement officers, lawyers and politicians.",
      "Some law-enforcement officials say the judge does not\u00a0sufficiently separate his activism from his day job. In 2020 the local district attorney\u2019s office applied to have him recused from hearing cannabis cases. Ricarda B\u00f6hme, a prosecutor, said in an interview that given \u201cthe objective overall view of his public statements\u201d the judge could in \u201cno way be able to reach an unbiased decision\u201d on such matters.",
      "But a higher court ruled for the judge and he was able to continue hearing those cases.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller was born in the town of Meppen in Lower Saxony. His father, traumatized by his experience as an 18-year-old soldier in World War II, drank himself to death when the judge was 11. His brother spent time in jail on a drug charge and died young. Judge M\u00fcller was the first member of his extended family to graduate from high school.",
      "\u201cIt was a present to my mother,\u201d he said about his career choice.",
      "Starting in Bernau as a judge in 1997, Judge M\u00fcller was part of a generation of judges from the former West Germany who came to the former East Germany to help modernize and democratize the judicial system after the collapse of communism.",
      "For all the leniency he has shown in cannabis trials, he has a reputation as an unsparing judge in other cases.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve sent quite a few people to prison,\u201d he said. A tabloid started calling him \u201cJudge Merciless\u201d until he threatened legal action.",
      "Before he became known for his advocacy on cannabis, Judge M\u00fcller was feared among far-right youths for his aggressive stance on prosecuting neo-Nazis.",
      "For a while he declared a specific footwear worn as an identification marker by German neo-Nazi skinheads \u2014 the Dr. Martens 16-eyelet boot with white shoelaces \u2014 a weapon in his courtroom, forcing visitors and witnesses who came wearing the boots to appear in socks. He gave conditional sentences that forced right-wing youth to visit mosques and share meals with immigrants from inner-city districts. He had people visit concentration camps and write essays. He meted out prison sentences for first offenses.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an activist in some ways and has been committed to liberal drug policies for years, but when it comes to other offenses, he\u2019s also known as a strict and uncompromising judge,\u201d said Hasso Suliak, lawyer and an editor at Legal Tribune Online, a German legal news site, who has followed Judge M\u00fcller\u2019s court cases.",
      "All this has made the judge at least a minor celebrity, especially in\u00a0Bernau bei Berlin. A recent packed day of trials in Bernau had to be delayed because Judge M\u00fcller heard a local electrician wanted to meet him.",
      "When he found his admirer, he gave him his latest calling card: a package of cigarette rolling paper with the judge\u2019s own image emblazed on one side and the words \u201clegalize it\u201d printed on the side.",

      "Lt. Cmdr. D.E. McShane was holding his plane ticket home to begin his retirement in 2019 when President \u200bDonald J. \u200bTrump announced that he would be flying to the border between the two Koreas to meet ",
      ", the leader of North Korea.",
      "Dan-o McShane, as the former U.S. Navy officer is known, had been stationed in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea for six years. Like the rest of the world, he learned of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to meet Mr. Kim in the DMZ on Twitter \u2014 only a day before the meeting was to take place.",
      "Suddenly, the lieutenant commander was thrust into making frantic preparations, his retirement plans scuppered.",
      "\u201cThat started a whole 24-hour communication event that would result in multiple messages passed overnight,\u201d said Commander McShane, who was the American-led United Nations Command\u2019s top military officer at the border in the village of Panmunjom at the time.",
      "\u201cI lay down on the couch for a minute and then at 4 a.m., North Korea would call because they\u2019re working just as hard on their side because Kim Jong-un\u2019s going to come down to them and that\u2019s probably a bigger cult of personality than the Donald Trump cult of personality.\u201d",
      "The Korean War armistice was signed at Panmunjom in 1953, creating\u00a0the DMZ as a buffer between the two Koreas. The U.N. Command and North Korea opened ",
      " as the sole point of contact between the two enemies.",
      "Each side has since assigned a joint duty officer\u200b at Panmunjom to help enforce the cease-fire. On the U.N. side, an American Navy officer has typically served a year or two under the U.N. flag. Commander McShane served for a record eight years, from 2013 to 2021, becoming the longest-serving U.N. joint duty officer at Panmunjom in history. He now teaches guitar to wounded American veterans at Camp Humphreys, south of Seoul, as part of a program sponsored by the American Red Cross and the Wounded Warrior Project.",
      "During that time, he faced off with North Korean troops, prepped for the Trump-Kim summit, saw tensions ebb and flow with the political mood and witnessed some of the most \u200bhair-raising \u2014 and \u200bbizarre \u2014 moments \u200bat the DMZ, the world\u2019s most heavily armed border.",
      "His first night on the job, a land mine exploded nearby. The next night, two went off. Soon, he stopped registering them; the DMZ is strewn with two million land mines. Animals step on them all of the time. It was \u201ca bit of a culture shock,\u201d Commander McShane recalled.",
      "Twice a day \u2014 at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. \u2014 he rang his North Korean\u00a0counterpart on a peach-colored phone the U.N. Command operated to ensure that the hotline was open.\u200b The messages were usually mundane: \u201cWe\u2019re trimming the grass over here. Don\u2019t shoot us!\u201d he said.",
      "Some U.S. soldiers in Panmunjom liked to call themselves the \u201cMerry Mad Monks of the DMZ\u201d because serving in such an isolated, off-limits spot was like living in a monastery. They organized cookouts and teed off at \u201c",
      ": a one-hole, par 3 surrounded on three sides by land mines.",
      "Unfamiliar with Navy abbreviations like LCDR, for lieutenant commander, Army soldiers stationed at the DMZ nicknamed Commander McShane \u201cthe Lord Commander,\u201d a reference to the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "He remembered once spotting a white dog ambling around Panmunjom. He fed and played with it for two weeks until it trotted across the demarcation line\u200b\u200b, \u201clike he\u2019s done it 1,000 times.\u201d",
      "The dog went up the stairs of the gray Stalinist building on the North Korean side. A soldier opened the door and the dog walked right in, never to be seen again. \u201cThe joke was, of course, that he\u2019s a spy,\u201d Commander McShane said.",
      "At Panmunjom, North Korean and U.S. officers occasionally meet in person, even talking baseball. The North Koreans loved Doritos and South Korean Choco Pies, Commander McShane said. The U.N. officers also brought Marlboro cigarettes and Johnnie Walker whiskey as gifts.",
      "But things could also get ugly.",
      "When inter-Korean relations soured in 2015 after two South Korean soldiers were ",
      " by North Korean booby traps, ",
      " \u200baround Panmunjom \u200bwith North Korean propaganda 20 hours a day \u2014 and with South Korean side blasting pop music.",
      "Sitting in his office one afternoon in 2017, Commander McShane recalled, he heard bursts of gunfire. Outside, a North Korean soldier was running his way across the border through a ",
      " before making it to the South, shot but alive. By then, the hotline was no longer working; the North Koreans had switched it off to protest U.N. sanctions imposed on the country after its third nuclear test in 2013.",
      "After the soldier\u2019s defection, Commander McShane and his \u200byoung \u200btranslator were ordered by his higher-ups to go outside with a bullhorn to deliver a message, standing near the borderline.",
      "It was dark and raining. Earlier that day, \u200bhe had heard \u200ba single gunshot from the North\u200b, likely the sound of \u200ban officer killing himself, knowing his fate for failing to stop the defector, Commander McShane recalled.",
      "Commander McShane used the bullhorn to\u200b invite the North to a joint investigation\u200b of the defection. \u200bBack in his office, \u200bhe saw a \u200bNorth Korean \u200bflashlight blinking\u200b at him\u200b, and he was ordered to go back outside and repeat the message. His translator hid behind a brick wall until she had to repeat the message in Korean.",
      "\u201cThey never replied to that series of messages, but that was the only time I ever felt super unsafe giving a message,\u201d the commander said.",
      "The Navy kept extending Commander McShane\u2019s tour because it had difficulty finding a qualified replacement. A joint duty officer at Panmunjom must be a lieutenant commander with a master\u2019s degree in East Asian studies and rigorous Korean language training. On the day of the Trump-Kim summit, the Navy extended his tour for the fifth time.",
      "\u201cUnpack,\u201d his boss texted that day. \u201c\u200bNo selfies with the president\u200b.\u201d",
      "North Korean officers showed up hours later with three crates packed with dozens of North Korean flags. Commander McShane had only\u00a0three American flags at his disposal. The North Korean \u201cguys are just furious with me,\u201d he recalled. They wondered, \u201c\u2018How can you not have all this American stuff up here?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, dude, I am the American stuff up here,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is U.N.\u201d",
      "A Marine Corps helicopter had to bring more American flags from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. He used coat hangers for a flag spreader.",
      "Daniel Edward McShane III speaks with a slight Southern accent and calls himself \u201ca little talky.\u201d Born in Charlotte, N.C., in 1970, he joined the Navy in 1999, and flew over Afghanistan and Iraq before being ",
      " for the Blue Angels, the Navy\u2019s aerobatic flying team.",
      "He said his most awkward moment at the DMZ was when Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, Kim Yo-jong, came to Panmunjom in 2018 to prepare for ",
      " with Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president at the time. During a meeting, Ms. Kim, who has served both as a charming emissary and as a foul-mouthed spokeswoman for her brother\u2019s regime, sat next to the commander, laughing and even lightly touching his arm.",
      "Soldiers at Panmunjom would later tease him, calling Ms. Kim his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d",
      "Sadly, Commander McShane said, the inter-Korean d\u00e9tente he witnessed during his times at the DMZ was \u201ctoo short.\u201d Relations between the two Koreas are at their lowest point in years, with North Korea ",
      ".",
      "Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon jointly planted the \u201cpeace and prosperity tree\u201d in Panmunjom to mark their 2018 summit, but the pine started browning shortly after it was planted. Commander McShane\u2019s top boss, U.S. Army Gen. Robert B. Abrams, told\u200b him: \u201cDon\u2019t let that tree die.\u201d (He added that the general was \u201ca little more forceful than that.\u201d)",
      "For a couple months, Commander McShane used a hose to water the tree himself. \u201cIn the DMZ, there are very few things you can point to as a visual kind of containment of hope,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep that thing going.\u201d",
      "The tree lived."

      "En las \u00faltimas semanas, Cuba ha tenido problemas con la escasez de combustible en toda la isla causada por los proveedores extranjeros que no est\u00e1n cumpliendo sus compromisos, seg\u00fan ha dicho su presidente. La econom\u00eda debilitada del pa\u00eds tambi\u00e9n ha dificultado que el gobierno importe sus propios diluyentes para refinar el crudo de baja calidad que recibe o para comprar crudo de mayor calidad que requiere menos refinaci\u00f3n.",
      "Cuba suele consumir entre 500 y 600 toneladas diarias de combustible, se\u00f1al\u00f3 a principios de este mes el presidente Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel. Ahora, dijo, la isla tiene menos de 400 toneladas al d\u00eda.",

Los taxistas cobran tarifas exorbitantes. Algunas universidades han vuelto a las clases en l\u00ednea. Los restaurantes y bares han ido perdiendo clientes. Hasta el Teatro Nacional de Cuba en La Habana cancel\u00f3 un concierto de la Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Nacional por falta de combustible.",

      "D\u00edaz-Canel ha negado que la crisis sea el resultado de las ineficiencias de Cuba o de las instituciones estatales. En cambio, la ha atribuido a pa\u00edses, como Venezuela, uno de sus proveedores de combustible desde hace mucho tiempo, que \u201cno han podido cumplir sus compromisos\u201d porque \u201chan estado tambi\u00e9n en una situaci\u00f3n energ\u00e9tica compleja\u201d, dijo.",

Los alimentos se han vuelto a\u00fan m\u00e1s escasos y m\u00e1s caros, las filas en las farmacias con pocos suministros comienzan antes del amanecer y millones de personas sufren apagones de horas cada d\u00eda.",

      "Desde su natal Rumania hasta un intento fallido de solicitud de asilo en B\u00e9lgica y despu\u00e9s un divorcio y dificultades econ\u00f3micas, la enfermedad de Iosif ha exacerbado crisis de su vida que casi siempre se han salido de control.",

      "En la sala de estar, los sonidos de los dibujos animados llenaban el ambiente. Etty, de 71 a\u00f1os, y Luc Hayen, de 75, estaban fascinados viendo un programa infantil de un rat\u00f3n en una descabellada aventura. En un sof\u00e1 color crema hab\u00eda un gato acurrucado.",

      "Se trata de un tipo de atenci\u00f3n psiqui\u00e1trica que, de acuerdo con los archivos, ha existido en Geel desde el siglo XIII. A mediados del siglo XIV, los lugare\u00f1os empezaron a construir una iglesia para Santa Dimpna, la santa patrona de los enfermos mentales, y la llegada de peregrinos a Geel no se hizo esperar. Se alojaban en las granjas de los campesinos de la localidad, donde trabajaban la tierra al lado de sus nuevas familias.",
      "Tanto la iglesia como esa tradici\u00f3n siguen en pie.",
      "Para finales del siglo XIX, casi 2000 hu\u00e9spedes viv\u00edan con los habitantes de Geel. En la actualidad, este pueblo de 41.000 habitantes en Flandes, la regi\u00f3n de B\u00e9lgica donde se habla neerland\u00e9s, alberga 120 hu\u00e9spedes en las casas de los lugare\u00f1os.",
      "Eso ha convertido a Geel tanto en un modelo de un prototipo diferente de tratamiento psiqui\u00e1trico como en un caso at\u00edpico, el cual ha tendido a generar desconfianza a lo largo de los siglos (hasta The New York Times en un ",

      "Esa desconfianza no hizo m\u00e1s que aumentar cuando el modelo de Geel choc\u00f3 con la psiquiatr\u00eda, un campo de la medicina que estaba en constante desarrollo.

Entre los hu\u00e9spedes hay personas con esquizofrenia u otros tipos de psicosis grave, pero que siguen un tratamiento y son capaces de ser funcionales dentro de una familia.",

      "A las familias de acogida nunca se les revela el diagn\u00f3stico, a menos que el hu\u00e9sped quiera compartirlo. Los trabajadores sociales se enfocan m\u00e1s bien en preparar a las familias para el tipo de comportamientos que deben esperar, el r\u00e9gimen de medicaci\u00f3n y las se\u00f1ales de alerta que deben notificar de inmediato.",
      "Algo fundamental para la confianza en este acuerdo es que hay trabajadores sociales disponibles las 24 horas del d\u00eda en el hospital cercano.",

      "El gobierno de B\u00e9lgica les proporciona a las familias de acogida una remuneraci\u00f3n de 23 a 28 euros (25-30 d\u00f3lares) al d\u00eda por cada hu\u00e9sped, cantidad que, a decir de todos, no es suficiente.",

Hace poco, B\u00e9lgica present\u00f3 una solicitud para que la UNESCO, la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Educaci\u00f3n, la Ciencia y la Cultura, reconozca el programa de hogares de acogida de Geel como un \u201cpatrimonio cultural intangible\u201d. Los responsables del programa tambi\u00e9n han puesto en marcha una campa\u00f1a publicitaria para que m\u00e1s familias quieran ofrecer hogares de acogida.",

No est\u00e1n seguros de c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n emparentados exactamente, pero en visitas semanales a lo largo de sus vidas, se han sentado en su regazo, comido con ella y celebrado con ella.",
      "Cuando Bak se enferm\u00f3 gravemente con un problema hep\u00e1tico, pas\u00f3 nueve semanas en coma y un total de cuatro meses en el hospital, Daems estuvo all\u00ed para ayudarla a superarlo y darle la bienvenida de regreso a casa.",

      "La trayectoria de varias d\u00e9cadas que Vandeperre ha tenido en el cuerpo de polic\u00eda de Geel le otorga una visi\u00f3n acerca de las preguntas que surgen con frecuencia a partir de la experiencia del pueblo: \u00bfes seguro este enfoque?, y \u00bfel modelo de Geel solo puede existir en Geel?",
      "Es com\u00fan que las autoridades de Geel se encuentren con hu\u00e9spedes que se comportan de manera extra\u00f1a en p\u00fablico o que incluso no respetan la ley, coment\u00f3 Vandeperre. Pero gracias a la cultura de los hogares de acogida de este pueblo, saben c\u00f3mo calmar estas situaciones y llamar de inmediato al hospital psiqui\u00e1trico.",
      "Este enfoque se diferencia del de Estados Unidos y otros lugares, donde es posible que lo primero que se haga sea llamar a las fuerzas del orden cuando alguien est\u00e1 teniendo una crisis de salud mental. En muchas situaciones en las que participan polic\u00edas con un entrenamiento inadecuado, los resultados pueden ser ",

      "Ellen Baxter, por ejemplo, cree que se pueden replicar los elementos fundamentales del modelo de Geel y ha pasado los \u00faltimos 35 a\u00f1os de su vida tratando de recrearlos en Nueva York.",
      "En 1975, Baxter, fundadora y directora de Broadway Housing Communities, una organizaci\u00f3n neoyorquina de beneficencia en el tema de la vivienda, estaba reci\u00e9n egresada de la licenciatura en psicolog\u00eda cuando, impaciente por saber m\u00e1s sobre el programa de familias de acogida, se fue un a\u00f1o a vivir a Geel. Regres\u00f3 a Nueva York y comenz\u00f3 a recabar fondos para construir edificios donde las personas con trastornos psiqui\u00e1tricos pudieran vivir dentro de una comunidad.",
      "El desarrollo m\u00e1s reciente, en el vecindario Sugar Hill de Harlem, es el que ella cree que se asemeja m\u00e1s a un \u201cGeel vertical\u201d. Este alberga familias y adultos solteros, algunos de los cuales viven con enfermedades mentales y muchos otros que no las padecen. Este complejo cuenta con un centro de cuidado diurno y un museo que atrae a quienes no viven en \u00e9l. Ah\u00ed todos se conocen.",
      "\u201cSe requieren dos elementos: un buen dise\u00f1o y tiempo\u201d, puntualiz\u00f3 Baxter en una entrevista.",
      "\u201cLa vida tiene que ver m\u00e1s con el pragmatismo de la cotidianeidad: hay contratiempos, hay gente que fallece y ni\u00f1os que nacen\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cLa proximidad de la experiencia dentro de una comunidad hace que los valores afloren, que no abandonemos a los ancianos ni a los enfermos mentales ni a los discapacitados\u201d.",
      "Bogaerts, el psic\u00f3logo, recuerda que la polic\u00eda fue llamada solo dos veces para resolver problemas importantes relacionados con los internos en Geel durante las dos d\u00e9cadas.",
      "Pero los incidentes ocurren.",
      "\u201cAlgunos d\u00edas son un poco m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles que otros\u201d, dijo Peetermans.",
      "Liliane Peeters, de 63 a\u00f1os, y su esposo, Jozef Vleugels, de 65, hab\u00edan estado albergando a un hu\u00e9sped durante 11 a\u00f1os cuando decidieron acoger a una segunda persona.",
      "Como una madre cuyos hijos ya no viv\u00edan en casa y que se hab\u00eda jubilado recientemente, Peeters sinti\u00f3 que su hogar ten\u00eda espacio para uno m\u00e1s. Despu\u00e9s de algunos ajustes menores, como averiguar que el nuevo hu\u00e9sped ten\u00eda problemas para hacer s\u00e1ndwiches, las cosas parecieron calmarse.",
      "\u201cQuer\u00eda asumir ese cuidado, tengo eso en alg\u00fan lugar dentro de m\u00ed\u201d, dijo. \u201cDe hecho, quer\u00eda a alguien para quien pudiera hacer los s\u00e1ndwiches\u201d.",
      "Un problema era que el ba\u00f1o estaba en un piso diferente al dormitorio del hu\u00e9sped, al pie de unas escaleras empinadas, y por la noche, Peeters le pidi\u00f3 que no lo usara para evitar ca\u00eddas.",
      "Una ma\u00f1ana, se despert\u00f3 y encontr\u00f3 al hu\u00e9sped en crisis despu\u00e9s de haber defecado en el piso del dormitorio. Peeters consigui\u00f3 guantes y un cepillo. Un asistente social la ayud\u00f3. El hu\u00e9sped regres\u00f3 al hospital.",
      "\u201cHay l\u00edmites en la atenci\u00f3n que las personas pueden dar y dar\u00e1n\u201d, dijo Bogaerts, el psic\u00f3logo. \u201cSi pasan cosas as\u00ed, si alguien ya lleva 10, 15 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s viviendo en una familia de acogida, entonces lograr\u00e1 encontrar una soluci\u00f3n\u201d. Agreg\u00f3: \u201cPero si sucede al principio, es demasiado\u201d.",
      "Otros episodios son menos conflictivos, pero profundamente desgarradores.",
      "Cuando Peetermans, quien hoy acoge a Iosif, Etty y Hayen, era ni\u00f1a, a menudo ve\u00eda a un hombre llamado Robert, un hu\u00e9sped que viv\u00eda con una familia en su calle, cortando rosas.",
      "A\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, cuando la familia adoptiva de Robert envejeci\u00f3, Peetermans decidi\u00f3 acogerlo. Robert se convirti\u00f3 en un hermano mayor para su hijo.",
      "Llevaba viviendo con ellos siete a\u00f1os cuando, durante la pandemia, su estado empeor\u00f3. En septiembre pasado se mud\u00f3 al hospital psiqui\u00e1trico, donde ahora lo visita regularmente.",
      "Peetermans se derrumb\u00f3 al contar la historia.",

Al a\u00f1o siguiente, el gobierno inform\u00f3 al Parlamento que Corea del Sur ingresaba 160 millones de d\u00f3lares anuales por negocios derivados de la presencia militar estadounidense, incluido el comercio sexual. (En ese momento, las exportaciones totales del pa\u00eds ascend\u00edan a 835 millones de d\u00f3lares).",
      "Algunas mujeres se trasladaron hasta los campamentos para buscar trabajo. Otras, como Cho, fueron secuestradas o atra\u00eddas con la promesa de un empleo. Un acto sexual sol\u00eda costar entre 5 y 10 d\u00f3lares, una suma que los proxenetas confiscaban. Aunque los d\u00f3lares no iban directamente al gobierno, entraban en la econom\u00eda, hambrienta de divisas.",

      "La mayor\u00eda de las veces, la sociedad tachaba a estas mujeres como yanggalbo, o \u201cprostitutas para Occidente\u201d, y las consideraban como parte del precio de mantener la presencia militar estadounidense en el pa\u00eds despu\u00e9s de la guerra.",

Los mercados negros prosperaron all\u00ed, ya que los surcoreanos clamaban por productos de contrabando procedentes de las operaciones militares estadounidenses posteriores a la guerra, as\u00ed como por divisas extranjeras.",

      "Pero el mi\u00e9rcoles ya no hab\u00eda duda sobre lo principal: Messi nunca volver\u00e1 a jugar para el PSG, y tanto el jugador como el club est\u00e1n de acuerdo en eso.",
      "El final no habr\u00e1 sido una sorpresa para ninguna de las partes. Entre el jugador y el club siempre hab\u00eda existido una relaci\u00f3n comercial, una que carece del peso emocional del tiempo que pas\u00f3 Messi en el Barcelona. Y aunque se discuti\u00f3 sobre la renovaci\u00f3n del contrato del delantero en las semanas y meses despu\u00e9s de que Messi llev\u00f3 a la selecci\u00f3n argentina al t\u00edtulo de la Copa Mundial en Catar, ninguna de las partes parec\u00eda comprometida a consumar un acuerdo.",
      "Pero despu\u00e9s de faltar a ",
      " el lunes, un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que los aficionados en Par\u00eds abuchearon a los l\u00edderes de la liga por una derrota en casa ante el Lorient, un equipo de media tabla que los hinchas esperaban ver aplastado por la descomunal plantilla del PSG, cualquier idea de una renovaci\u00f3n se extingui\u00f3.",
      "Despu\u00e9s de una victoria, los lunes suelen ser un d\u00eda libre para los jugadores del PSG. Sin embargo, cuando pierden, se espera que los jugadores entrenen.",
      "Sin embargo, ya el lunes en la tarde, Messi y su familia estaban siendo fotografiados en Arabia Saudita cumpliendo con el contrato de varios a\u00f1os que el jugador firm\u00f3 para promover a la autoridad tur\u00edstica del reino del golfo P\u00e9rsico. En Par\u00eds, los directivos del club estaban formulando su airada respuesta ante la ausencia no aprobada de su estrella.",
      "Para el martes por la noche, se corri\u00f3 la voz de que el PSG no ceder\u00eda ante Messi. Oficialmente, el club no ha dicho mucho. Pero las sanciones impuestas al astro se filtraron r\u00e1pidamente: hab\u00eda sido suspendido de participar en los entrenamientos y los juegos por dos semanas, tiempo durante el cual no recibir\u00e1 un centavo de su salario gigantesco, que se estima en unos 800.000 d\u00f3lares por semana. En privado, un directivo del club dijo que era poco probable que Messi volviera a lucir los colores del club.",
      "Al igual que el PSG, Messi y sus representantes permanecieron en silencio a medida que la especulaci\u00f3n sobre el desmoronamiento de su relaci\u00f3n crec\u00eda tras bambalinas. Sin embargo, del lado de Messi se ha informado sobre su versi\u00f3n de la historia a una variedad de personalidades medi\u00e1ticas. Seg\u00fan esos reportes emitidos esta semana, Messi ten\u00eda la impresi\u00f3n de que ten\u00eda el permiso del club para realizar su emprendimiento comercial. El jugador hab\u00eda decidido hace un mes, inform\u00f3 uno, que no se quedar\u00eda en Par\u00eds para una tercera temporada. Incluso hab\u00eda comunicado esa decisi\u00f3n al club, seg\u00fan los reportes.",
      "Mientras tanto, el club estaba haciendo lo mismo. La preocupaci\u00f3n inmediata, al parecer, no era reparar la relaci\u00f3n, sino controlar la narrativa. Pero, al centrarse en los detalles, se ignor\u00f3 lo obvio: el desenlace de esta semana representa el punto m\u00e1s bajo en la relaci\u00f3n transaccional de Messi no solo con el PSG sino tambi\u00e9n con el Estado de Catar. Hace menos de dos a\u00f1os, el jugador hab\u00eda anunciado como un triunfo su traslado a Par\u00eds, una llegada sin sobresaltos despu\u00e9s de que abandon\u00f3 el Barcelona, entre l\u00e1grimas y obligado por los problemas de presupuesto del club. Desde entonces, el PSG ha hecho todo lo posible para asociarse con el genio de Messi.",
      "El matrimonio por conveniencia no podr\u00eda haber resultado mejor para el jugador, el club y el pa\u00eds. Messi firm\u00f3 uno de los contratos m\u00e1s generosos del deporte. El PSG, que es propiedad de una empresa catar\u00ed, agreg\u00f3 otro nombre de clase mundial a su b\u00fasqueda, hasta ahora infructuosa, de un t\u00edtulo de la Liga de Campeones. Mientras tanto, Catar incorpor\u00f3 a una figura destacada antes del evento m\u00e1s grande en la historia de esa naci\u00f3n: ",
      ". Adem\u00e1s, Messi interpret\u00f3 un papel protag\u00f3nico en ese torneo que termin\u00f3 cuando el emir de Catar arrop\u00f3 al jugador con una t\u00fanica tradicional, el ",
      ", para luego desfilar al campe\u00f3n por las calles de Lusail como un trofeo.",
      "Personas cercanas al PSG expresaron su sorpresa el mi\u00e9rcoles con la caracterizaci\u00f3n de la salida de Messi y c\u00f3mo fue presentada a su favor. Dijeron que, en realidad, el PSG hab\u00eda sido muy cuidadoso con la idea de una renovaci\u00f3n de contrato porque se quiere implementar un plan para remodelar al club y alejarlo de su imagen como un equipo adicto a superestrellas como Messi, Neymar y Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. La idea es convertirlo en una escuadra que dependa m\u00e1s del talento local. Los representantes de Messi incluso comunicaron la cantidad de dinero que el jugador aceptar\u00eda para quedarse en el club, una propuesta de aumento salarial que estaba mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de todo lo que el equipo hab\u00eda ofrecido tentativamente en enero. Sin embargo, para ese entonces, es posible que ya fuera demasiado tarde.",
      "Los indicios de un conflicto comenzaron a manifestarse casi tan pronto como Messi regres\u00f3 de Catar como campe\u00f3n mundialista. El PSG comenz\u00f3 a desdibujarse cuando la temporada de la liga se reanud\u00f3 en el A\u00f1o Nuevo y su ventaja, que alguna vez fue incuestionable, comenz\u00f3 a reducirse. El equipo sali\u00f3 de la Copa Francesa y tambi\u00e9n de la Liga de Campeones, lo que ocasion\u00f3 una gran frustraci\u00f3n entre sus propietarios catar\u00edes y sus aficionados parisinos.",
      "Al mismo tiempo, los abucheos de los hinchas ac\u00e9rrimos del PSG se volvieron m\u00e1s intensos y las opiniones m\u00e1s airadas comenzaron a centrarse cada vez m\u00e1s en Messi, cuyo desempe\u00f1o y producci\u00f3n, tal vez como se esperaba de un jugador de 35 a\u00f1os que sali\u00f3 de una agotadora Copa del Mundo, disminuyeron por debajo de su esplendor habitual.",
      "En las \u00faltimas semanas, los observadores de Messi \u2014que forman parte de una industria improvisada que se centra en analizar el estrellato del jugador y su destreza en el f\u00fatbol\u2014 especularon sobre ad\u00f3nde podr\u00eda aterrizar la pr\u00f3xima temporada. \u00bfUn regreso a Barcelona, tal vez? \u00bfUna aventura estadounidense en Miami? \u00bfUna estad\u00eda extendida en Arabia Saudita?

      "Visiting the zone a year later, past calamity and current tragedy intersect in strange and fascinating ways.",
      "The meltdown in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, has tainted the land for hundreds of years to come and laid bare the dangers of a political culture built on lies. It contributed to the demise of the Communist system and the collapse of the Soviet Union.",
      "Russia\u2019s invasion was justified with other Kremlin lies: that Ukrainian statehood was a myth, and that Kyiv was ruled by Nazis.",
      "Before the war, ",
      ", once home to tens of thousands of atomic workers before it was abandoned, had become a dark tourist attraction for those drawn to post-apocalyptic desolation. The Soviet-era apartment blocks crumbled as wolves prowled the hallways. A Ferris wheel in an amusement park that was scheduled to open on May 1, 1986, gathered more rust with each passing year.",
      "Visiting the villages around Chernobyl offered a chance to step into a moment frozen in time, with everything left where it was more than three decades ago. Children\u2019s toys sit in yards thick with brush. Tattered clothes are strewn in bedrooms where residents left them as they fled. A dusty cradle glimpsed through a broken window pane offers a reminder that in a now-dead place, there was once new life.",
      "Now, with cities across Ukraine obliterated, the ruins of Chernobyl feel less otherworldly than grimly familiar. Distant explosions set off by animals stepping on mines laid by the Russians are a reminder that this land from the past is very much part of the present.",

      "\u201cThis is the time when over 5,000 Russian military vehicles entered the zone, drove along the ground roads, and then soldiers started digging the trenches,\u201d Mr. Kirejev said. \u201cThey churned up the radioactive dust that was in the upper layer of the ground.\u201d",

      "Even a quick look at the bunkers the Russians carved out in the most contaminated parts of the zone made clear how careless they had been. The soldiers also set fires and cooked on dirt so radioactive that it made a Geiger counter leap off the charts when tested on a recent visit. There are conflicting reports about whether Russian soldiers fell sick from radiation poisoning.",
      "For the small band of aging residents who remain in the zone, the Russian invasion and the nuclear disaster are catastrophes that bookend their lives.",

      "Before the meltdown, Ms. Voloshyna said, Chernobyl was a company town known for its great natural beauty. She was 36 and the director of the local kindergarten when the night sky lit up before dawn on April 26, 1986. In the days after the meltdown, she joined other residents in shoveling sand into sacks that were flown by helicopters and dumped in the reactor.",

      ". Then the power and water were cut off. But Ms. Voloshyna was determined to stay in the home built by her grandfather more than half a century earlier, nestled on the banks of the Pripyat River.",
      "Unlike when the meltdown happened, the danger from the Russians who stormed in last winter was immediately clear. That night, one resident, Evgen Markevych, 86, put his thoughts down in his diary.",

Then, he will set out with his three brothers and father across the Gaza Strip.",
      "They will begin with their mother but eventually visit some 15 sisters, aunts and nieces, doling out dinars and shekels as part of a Palestinian custom of men marking the Muslim holiday by giving an eidiya, a gift of money, to female relatives.",
      "The visits will follow an almost choreographed routine. At each home, the men will be plied with coffee and sweets. After little more than 15 minutes, the social calls will end \u2014 a rarity in a society where such visits may last for hours, and often end in an invitation to stay for dinner.",
      "\u201cThis is the eidiya visit,\u201d said Mr. Helles, 48, a professor of social services at Al-Quds Open University, in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our important traditions.\u201d",
      "Giving an eidiya has long been a practice among Muslims \u2014 though it has no religious basis \u2014 and is believed by some to date back 1,000 years to the Fatimid dynasty and the practice of emirs giving gold coins or gifts during festivities.",
      "But in most Muslim cultures, adults give an eidiya to children, sometimes in small, token amounts. Palestinians give the money to both children and adult female relatives, making the tradition far more expensive, with the kind of financial burden and expectations that Christmas gift giving has in the West. The amounts can range from 20 shekels, about $6, to 365 shekels, about $100.",
      "These days, coming up with the money for the eidiya is especially onerous.",
      "The 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt has undermined the living conditions of more than two million Palestinians, and led to a nearly 50 percent unemployment rate that is among the highest in the world.",
      "To give the eidiya, some men will go into debt. Others will wait until their wives get their eidiya from relatives before turning around and using that money to give the gift to their other female relatives.",
      "\u201cHowever bad one\u2019s financial situation is, we have to go and give,\u201d said Mr. Helles\u2019s father, Hamid al-Abid Helles, 74. \u201cThis is a tradition we won\u2019t abandon.\u201d",
      "The practice comes at the end of a month of already added expenses for Ramadan, with the elaborate dinners after daily fasts, and decoration of homes and purchase of new clothes to be worn on Eid. In the weeks leading up to the holiday \u2014 which this year begins on Friday \u2014 shopping districts in Gaza were packed, with seasonal religious music just audible over the din of shoppers and honking horns.",
      "At each relative\u2019s house, Mr. Helles, his brothers and father will be served strong Turkish coffee, Eid date ",
      " and chocolates \u2014 part of the Eid diyafah, or hospitality. They will eat just enough to be polite but remain conscious that at the next stop they will be offered the same spread and encouraged to indulge.",
      "\u201cBy the end we have a stomachache,\u201d said Mr. Helles, a father of six. \u201cWe put all the chocolate in our pockets and tell them we\u2019ll eat it later.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe comes back home and his pocket is bulging with chocolates,\u201d said his wife, Basima Helles, 44.",
      "During each visit, the men will keep an eye on their watches. After 15 minutes, they\u2019ll begin making moves to leave, and call to the women of the house to accept the eidiya. The women, in turn, will protest out of politeness. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no need,\u201d they\u2019ll say. Some will put their hands behind their backs to avoid being handed the money.",
      "To lessen the embarrassment of bills being pressed into palms, shops across Gaza are now offering eidiya cards and small boxes to put the money in, to make the custom feel more like gift giving and less transactional. Some cards mention every female relation that could be on the receiving end of an eidiya: my granddaughter, my wife, my mother-in-law.",
      "Every year Ms. Helles tells her own brother not to give her an eidiya, because she knows that his financial situation is precarious, and that she is one of six sisters.",
      "\u201cWe say, \u2018we forgive you, we excuse you,\u2019 but he\u2019s not willing to come empty-handed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe considers this a social obligation.\u201d",
      "The next day, when women go to visit their families for Eid, she will return the money by giving it as an eidiya to his children.",
      "As the economic situation in Gaza has worsened in recent years, men unable to afford the gift giving have stopped visiting relatives altogether during Eid to avoid embarrassment.",
      "But religious leaders urge men not to abandon a religious obligation \u2014 visiting family \u2014 for the sake of a cultural one \u2014 the eidiya.",
      "That message hasn\u2019t always been heeded.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have an eidiya, it\u2019s better not to go,\u201d said Abdulmutee Matar, 31. \u201cBecause they are accustomed to when you greet them and shake hands, you have money in your hand. If your hand is empty .\u2026\u201d he trailed off, waving his empty hand in the air for emphasis.",
      "He used to give 50 shekels each to his wife, mother, four sisters and eight aunts when he ran his family\u2019s third-generation clothing store. But three years ago, he had to close the shop.",
      "Since then, he has only had occasional work but is still unwilling to give up the tradition. His mother, a teacher, gives him money so he can at least go see his sisters to give the eidiya. He no longer visits his aunts on Eid.",
      "For women, the eidiya can be an extra financial boost.",
      "Last year, Hanadi Tawaahena\u2019s father gave an eidiya to her three sisters and mother but not to her. He told her that was because she had a home baking business and was making her own money.",
      "\u201cThe eidiya is important, even if I work,\u201d said Ms. Tawaahena, 34, last week as she made Eid cookies in a house smelling of ghee and semolina flour. The sweets\u00a0will be part of the diyafah in homes across Gaza. She said it was not just a matter of money, but a matter of principle and being part of a longstanding tradition.",
      "She added with a laugh, \u201cI told him, \u2018Don\u2019t do that again.\u2019\u201d",
      "For other women, it is about the money, and they plan well in advance what to do with their haul, including buying a needed household item or clothes for their children.",
      "Ms. Tawaahena\u2019s sister, Shoroq, 28, was rolling out ground dates to stuff the cookies. She had already made plans with her friends to take their eidiya money and spend it at Gaza City\u2019s boardwalk and restaurants.",
      "\u201cWomen on Eid become rich,\u201d Hanadi Tawaahena said, with another laugh.",
      "Sitting on the other end of the table, rolling out dough, the sisters\u2019 mother, 50-year-old Ashjan, agreed.",
      "\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cthey make the men poor.\u201d"

      "On a recent sunny morning on the banks of the Adda River in northern Italy, schoolchildren on a class trip to Imbersago \u2014 the \u201cTown of the Ferry of Leonardo da Vinci\u201d \u2014 gathered next to a moored boat and listened as a guide explained how the flights of the river\u2019s birds, the formations of its rocks and the workings of its ships inspired Leonardo\u2019s genius.",
      "\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it move?\u201d one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, \u201cService suspended.\u201d It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.",
      "\u201cThe water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,\u201d answered Sara Asperti, 45. \u201cAlso, they\u2019re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.\u201d",
      "Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks\u00a0of the Adda\u00a0belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and ",
      " the motorless ferry around 1513. Later, the invention of the ferry, or its improvement, was attributed to him, though locals say no one knows for sure.",
      "In the past century, reproductions of the original\u00a0ferries have linked Italy\u2019s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.",
      "But a year after Italy\u2019s worst drought in seven decades \u2014 when much of Europe gasped for precipitation \u2014 a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country\u2019s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not Moses,\u201d she responded.",
      "This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls \u201cLeonardesque\u201d ferries has become a stationary landmark.",
      "\u201cIf it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,\u201d said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago\u2019s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was \u201cthe family jewel of the town \u2014 we cannot be left without it.\u201d",
      "The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was \u201cevidence of a global problem.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.\u201d",
      "But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry\u2019s immobility since May.",
      "\u201cBureaucracy,\u201d said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.",
      "Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.",
      "The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn\u2019t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals \u2014 \u201cYou should see the hair on this guy,\u201d he said, cupping the phone \u2014 remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.",
      "\u201cI mean Leonardo wasn\u2019t a moron,\u201d he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s to scale; it\u2019s worth 500 euros,\u201d or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.",
      "\u201cThe force of the ferry is these,\u201d Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.",
      "What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring \u201cThe Human Face of the Ferry\u201d and its pilots over the past century. \u201cHarvard, Harvard, Harvard,\u201d Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. \u201cThey all went to Harvard.\u201d",
      "Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.",
      "\u201cI thought with my license I could do it,\u201d Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo\u2019s sketch and an excerpt from Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d about Charon, \u201cferryman of the damned.\u201d",
      "A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association \u2014 which has the ferry as its logo \u2014 Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really long process,\u201d said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.",
      "In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.",
      "Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant \u201cwe will suffer this summer.\u201d",
      "Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and \u201ckeep the tap closed\u201d to ensure the lake\u2019s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area\u2019s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.",
      "Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where \u201cI found a lot of dead fish.\u201d",
      "Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo\u2019s \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of that is usually covered with water,\u201d Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. \u201cIn 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen the river like this.\u201d",
      "Near Imbersago\u2019s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.",
      "\u201cThere used to be people in the piazza,\u201d he said, as the iron hissed. \u201cThose times are finished.\u201d",
      "Evening fell and the day\u2019s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s months that it doesn\u2019t rain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.\u201d",
      "Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s two drops,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d"

      "BORNE SULINOWO, Poland \u2014 Set in a thick forest, ringed by limpid lakes and free of violent crime, the town of Borne Sulinowo in northwestern Poland has undeniable bucolic charm \u2014 except for the ghosts on every eerily quiet street of the Nazi and then Soviet soldiers who built it.",
      "Governed for the past three decades by Poland, the town was controlled by and part of Germany before World War II; seized by the Red Army in 1945; and occupied by Moscow\u2019s forces until 1992. For a time, it embraced its dark side, eager to attract visitors and money to a forlorn and formerly forbidden zone so secret it did not appear on maps.",
      "Military re-enactors, including enthusiasts from Germany and Russia, visited each year to stage a parade, dressed in Soviet and Nazi uniforms, which are banned from public display in Germany.",
      "A Polish businessman opened the Russia Hotel, decorating it with photographs of himself and a friend dressed in Russian military uniforms and with communist-era banners embroidered with images of Lenin. His other ventures in the town included a cafe named after Rasputin and boozy, Russia-themed corporate events.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion of Ukraine stopped all that. Kitsch became offensively creepy.",
      "\u201cEverything changed very quickly,\u201d said Monika Konieczna-Pilszek, the manager of the Russia Hotel and daughter of its founder. Online reviews, she said, suddenly went from \u201ccommenting on our food to talking about burning us down.\u201d",
      "She told her father they had to change the name. \u201cInstead of attracting people it was repelling them,\u201d she said. The inn is now called the Borne Sulinowo Guesthouse. A big Soviet banner hung in the hallway next to its restaurant has been turned round so Lenin is no longer visible.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to be reminded of Russia these days,\u201d Ms. Koniecnza-Pilszek said.",
      "Dariusz Tederko, a local official responsible for promoting the town, lamented that the war in Ukraine \u201chas turned everything upside down.\u201d The military re-enactors, he said, are no longer welcome. The Russians couldn\u2019t come anyway because of a government ban.",
      "Trying to draw more Poles and Western Europeans, he now promotes the town\u2019s less triggering charms. \u201cWe have lots of beautiful heather,\u201d he said, waving a brochure with pictures of hiking trails and wildflowers.",
      "But he misses the prewar days when Russia was \u201cnot so sensitive,\u201d and Borne Sulinowo did not have to feel ashamed about the one thing that set it apart from countless other places in Poland offering pleasant scenery and pretty flowers.",
      "He said he was still in touch with retired Russian soldiers, including one now working in the Kremlin, who served here during the Cold War and who used to return regularly for trips down memory lane.",
      "Unlike many Poles, residents of Borne Sulinowo often harbor little personal animosity toward Russians. They are appalled by the bloodshed in Ukraine but blame Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.",
      "During the Soviet era, the town \u2014 home to more than 10,000 soldiers of the Northern Group of Forces \u2014 was a world unto itself, scrubbed from maps and off limits to Poles without special entry passes, though many still sneaked in to buy food and vodka.",
      "Renata Szmurlo, a nurse who grew up in a Polish town near the Soviet zone and moved to Borne Sulinowo with her family after the Russians left, recalled a carefree youth of cycling past military checkpoints with her friends to visit the town\u2019s shops. They accepted Polish currency but, stocked with supplies from Moscow for Soviet officers, had more goods than Polish ones.",
      "\u201cThe Russians were great guys,\u201d she recalled.",
      "When the town was part of Germany, Hitler visited, arriving by train in 1938 to inspect what was then a secret military training ground, set up in the forest so that Nazi commanders could furtively practice the blitzkrieg tactics that, just a year later, would plunge Poland and then the rest of Europe into World War II.",
      "\u201cIf you just look at the trees and buildings, everything here looks OK, but if you know the history of this place it makes your skin crawl,\u201d said Dariusz Czerniawski, a former teacher who moved to Borne Sulinowo shortly after the last Russians pulled out. They left a ghost town of empty, dilapidated barracks, suddenly silent shooting ranges and fields rutted with tank tracks.",
      "After a year under the control of the Polish army, Borne Sulinowo reappeared on maps in 1993 as just another Polish town, inhabited by a few early pioneers like Mr. Czerniawski. \u201cIt was so quiet, I wanted to scream,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe silence and emptiness were terrifying.\u201d",
      "Over time, more Poles arrived, attracted by cheap housing and the chance for a fresh start. The town now has nearly 5,000 year-round residents and many more people during the summer. It still feels empty and isolated.",
      "The main road \u2014 Adolf Hitler Strasse during the Nazi period and Stalin Avenue after 1945 \u2014 is now Independence Street.",
      "Lined with gimcrack Soviet apartment blocks intermingled with sturdy villas left by the Germans, it has a few shops, a defunct pizza place and the Sasha Cafe, run by a Russian-speaking man from eastern Ukraine, who first came here as a young photographer working for the Soviet military command.",
      "A target of suspicious whispering by locals and scrutiny by Polish authorities, he recently put his property up for sale.",
      "Mr. Czerniawski, the early pioneer, today runs the town\u2019s museum and has spent a lot of time thinking about how to deal with the past.",
      "\u201cIt would perhaps be easier to demolish the whole town,\u201d he said, \u201cBut what would that give us \u2014 just a big empty space with no memory of anything?\u201d",
      "Borne Sulinowo, he believes, needs to survive as a \u201cunique place built by the two most brutal totalitarian systems of the last century\u201d \u2014 and as a reminder of where such systems lead. \u201cUsually to war,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe have to remember our bad past so that we can learn something for the future,\u201d he said.",
      "He has resisted suggestions to remove from the museum a mannequin dressed in a Russian military uniform and has rejected demands that the Soviet-designed tank opposite the entrance be taken away. Some residents threatened to destroy it.",
      "But the tank, Mr. Czerniawski noted, was put there",
      "by Polish authorities, who took it from a Warsaw military museum. \u201cIt is Soviet design but was made in Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is part of our history \u2014 perhaps not the glorious history we would like \u2014 but it is ours,\u201d he said.",
      "The most sinister reminders of Moscow\u2019s former hegemony \u2014 concrete bunkers housing nuclear warheads \u2014 have mostly been swallowed up by the forest near Brzeznica-Kolonia, a village 19 miles south of town.",
      "\u201cEntry Categorically Forbidden. Danger of death or disability,\u201d read signs put up in front of the crumbling, weed-clogged bunkers.",
      "Until the warheads were taken back to Russia in 1990 as the Soviet Union unraveled, they were part of the Vistula Program, a top-secret deployment of nuclear weapons in Poland that began in the 1960s. Throughout the Cold War, Moscow insisted it had no nuclear weapons in Poland while accusing the United States of threatening peace by putting its own warheads in Europe.",
      "For Jan Chmielowski, a Pole who first visited Borne Sulinowo in 1994 and \u201cimmediately fell in love with this strange place,\u201d the Soviet past was for years \u201cjust a big sad joke\u201d because everything left by the Russians seemed to be falling apart.",
      "He bought an old German villa, turned it into a guesthouse and, inspired by the Russia Hotel next door, began organizing corporate team-building events featuring vodka, surly Soviet-style service and mock arrests by fake Russian officers with guns. He has dropped that and now organizes French-themed events with champagne and without weapons.",
      "\u201cEverything Russian stopped being funny after the war in Ukraine,\u201d he lamented."

      "Once a month, some pearlies\u00a0rattle blue plastic buckets to collect charity donations at Covent Garden, a former market turned tourist draw, in London\u2019s West End.",
      "\u201cMost Londoners know about the Pearly Kings and Queens,\u201d said John Walters, 75, who holds the title of Pearly King of Finsbury, an area of north London. \u201cI had an elderly lady come up here and she grabbed hold of me and she started crying and said, \u2018I\u2019m so pleased to see you\u2019re still around.\u2019 She said, \u2018You are London.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tourists, though, are often pleasantly\u00a0surprised\u00a0to encounter them.",
      "On a bright March morning, Mr. Walters and Clive Bennett, 68, the Pearly King of Woolwich, in the city\u2019s southeast, were approached by a group of young women \u2014 one wearing a \u201cbride to be\u201d sash \u2014 who asked for a photograph. The men, in Cockney accents, instantly broke into a rendition of \u201cGet Me to the Church on Time\u201d from \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d as the women erupted in laughter and threw a few pounds into their buckets. The men tipped their flat caps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real honor to be able to do something like this actually, and it\u2019s fun,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cYou meet all sorts of people.\u201d",
      "He was invited to take part in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics and took part in events on the sidelines of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s jubilee and funeral.",
      "The over-the-top outfits that the pearlies are known for \u2014 with the back of their clothing bearing their august titles in bold lettering \u2014 are as peculiar as they are eye-catching, with feathers, shine and patterns assaulting the eyes. The idea for the finery grew from the tradition in\u00a0Cockney culture of\u00a0thumbing noses at London society\u2019s disdainful view of the lower classes.",
      "For Mr. Bennett, and many others, being a pearly is a family affair. His wife, Kim, 66, is a Pearly Queen and his daughter and grandchildren take part in fund-raising\u00a0events, as well, under the title of Pearly Princesses and Princes.",
      "Like most royal families, pearlies typically inherit their titles or marry into the tradition. But others, like the Bennetts, have been invited in because of their commitment to community work and charity.",
      "\u201cToday, there is a need for us now more than ever, \u201d Ms. Bennett said, as she pointed to the\u00a0inflationary pressures on many local\u00a0communities.",
      "Henry Croft \u2014 an orphan and a London street sweeper \u2014 is considered the first Pearly King. In the late 1870s, he\u00a0became known for covering his clothing with mother-of-pearl buttons to draw attention as he collected money for hospitals and orphanages.",
      "Mr. Croft was said to have taken his fashion inspiration from costermongers, who were roving traders selling fruit, vegetables, fish and produce on the streets of east London, a working-class area that developed its own distinct accent and vocabulary riddled with rhyming slang, known as Cockney.",
      "The costermongers sewed buttons onto their clothes to distinguish themselves and to mimic the rich, ",
      ". These coster communities would elect a leader in their local area to keep the peace and collect money to support fellow traders down on their luck.",
      "\u201cIf someone\u2019s fruit went off, or the donkey was ill, or something like that,\u201d said Mr. Bennett, describing how the costermongers would have a singalong and pass around a bucket for donations. \u201cI think that\u2019s where Henry Croft got his whole ethos from.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Croft took his pearly suits and generosity to a new level, putting on his dazzling button suit as he gathered money for the poor and the sick.",
      "Others soon joined him. At the time of Mr. Croft\u2019s funeral in 1930, dozens of pearlies from across London joined the cortege to honor him, ",
      ".",
      "While London lore holds that to be a true Cockney, a person must be born within earshot of Bow Bells, which ring from ",
      " in east London, pearly titles are now held by people from communities across all of London\u2019s boroughs.",
      "While some pearly traditions have shifted, the rules on the buttons themselves have stayed consistent: They must be true mother-of-pearl, not imitation. Generally, they are passed down through families.",
      "\u201cA lot of the buttons are over 100 years old on there,\u201d said David Hemsley, 60, describing the jacket he inherited from his father.",
      "In Covent Garden, after a few hours of cheekily delivering rhyming Cockney slang to curious crowds and singing old tunes with gusto while collecting donations, the pearlies make their way into the nearby St. Paul\u2019s Church to hold their monthly meeting.",
      "\u201cCome on then, let\u2019s go!\u201d\u00a0Doreen Golding, 83, the Pearly Queen of Bow Bells and the Old Kent Road, shouted to the group as she led the way to the church vestry.",
      "As the chairwoman of London\u2019s Pearly Kings and Queens Society, Ms. Golding was honored by the late queen for her charity efforts. She said the pearlies would continue to wear their buttons and keep up their charitable giving for as long as there was a need.",
      "\u201cI get upset when someone says, \u2018Oh, are you still around? We didn\u2019t think there was any more of you left,\u2019\u201d Ms. Golding said with a laugh. \u201cAnd I think, \u2018Now hang on, open your bloody eyes and look, we are here!\u2019\u201d"

      "In the first days of the Iranian New Year holiday in March, the police showed up at a cafe in Tehran with orders to shut it down for two days. The cafe had run afoul of Iranian law by serving women who were not covering their hair with head scarves, they said.",
      "Since then, the cafe\u2019s management has been summoned repeatedly by the authorities and ordered to warn customers to wear their scarves. Mohammad, the owner, grudgingly did the bare minimum, putting a sign on the wall telling women to respect the hijab law. There is little point in doing more, he said.",
      "Emboldened since the women-led protests that broke out last fall, which turned into ",
      " against the Islamic Republic, ",
      " of Iranian women have started going around without head scarves and wearing Western-style clothes. In Iran, Mohammad said, forcing women to wear the hijab is a lost cause.",
      "\u201cIn all honesty, we didn\u2019t get upset when they shut down our cafe,\u201d said Mohammad, who asked to be identified only by his first name to avoid further legal repercussions. \u201cIn fact, we felt good about it, because this is really good P.R. for us and our business.\u201d",
      "His nonchalance suggested the depth and speed of change in Iran, where the theocratic government considers the dress code a matter of existential importance. As temperatures rise and more women go out in outfits that run flagrantly afoul of the law mandating modest clothing, official efforts to enforce it could intensify the conflict between Iranians and their clerical rulers.",
      "Determined to reclaim control after months of destabilizing protests that called its authority into question, the government recently tried a fresh tack in its campaign to enforce the hijab law, closing 150 businesses in just 24 hours for serving improperly veiled women. It also announced that the authorities would use surveillance cameras and other tools to go after women violating the law.",
      "Women seen on surveillance footage going unveiled in public could be prosecuted, and those caught driving without a head scarf could have their cars impounded, the police said.",
      "Citing Iran\u2019s interior minister, a member of Iran\u2019s parliament, known as the Majlis, said recently that women who do not wear the hijab in public will first receive a warning via text message. A second strike means the woman will be refused public services, he said, and a third could mean a referral for prosecution. Though he did not specify what kinds of public services would be denied, the penalty may include barring affected women from banks, government offices and university and school campuses.",
      "On Monday, the mayor of Tehran, Iran\u2019s capital, said that guards at subway stations would begin stopping unveiled women from riding the metro, first verbally warning them and then ejecting them from the station.",
      "Aspects of the crackdown are nothing new. For the last several years, the authorities have issued summonses to women caught driving without veils by traffic cameras, sending them to morality education centers instead of traffic school. But the announcement suggests the use of surveillance to enforce the hijab may become far more widespread, though details are scarce about the government\u2019s technology.",
      "The authorities are also trying to enlist private businesses such as hotels, restaurants, cafes and bookstores, warning them to enforce the law inside their walls or risk closure.",
      "In recent interviews, workers and managers at businesses that were shut down recently said they were reluctant to comply. Customers and tourists would no longer come, they said, adding that people were too used to their newly claimed freedom and would simply go elsewhere.",
      "But the shutdowns, on top of an already flailing economy, may increase the financial pressure on businesses.",
      "Fahimeh, 40, who works in the beauty and fashion industry in Tehran and has been flouting the hijab law, said that while she opposed \u201cbullying\u201d by the authorities, \u201cI, for one, don\u2019t want my freedom at the cost of another person suffering.\u201d",
      "Going without a hijab appears to be most common among privileged urbanites, but an increasing number of women are flouting the requirement to cover their heads and dress modestly in the long, loose cover-ups known as manteaus, including in smaller cities and more conservative neighborhoods.",
      "When officers came to shut down Mohammad\u2019s cafe, he said, he pointed at a table where two women were sitting, one unveiled and the other wearing the conservative, full-length and all-black veil known as the chador.",
      "\u201cI told him, \u2018Eventually you have to accept this. I\u2019m not a sociologist, but I\u2019m pretty sure what you\u2019re doing has almost no effect,\u2019\u201d Mohammad said.",
      "\u201cFor now, it seems like the only solution the regime has is to increase the pressure on businesses,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cEventually, the regime will give up. It doesn\u2019t have either the capacity or the support of the majority to stand in the way of women.\u201d",
      "Many Iranian women still wear the head scarf, both voluntarily and because of family pressure, especially in more conservative parts of the country. A significant conservative slice of society still supports government enforcement, and the rapid spread of unveiled women has exposed a degree of polarization between them and more liberal Iranians. A ",
      " showed a man in Shandiz, a city in northeastern Iran, throwing yogurt at two women who were not wearing head scarves in a grocery store.",
      "Reza, who works as a manager at a tourism business in Isfahan Province, south of Tehran, said the company was shut down for nearly three days in mid-March. He said tourists preferred a freer environment, and forcing businesses to enforce the hijab law would harm an industry still struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe coercion and punishment won\u2019t force women into wearing hijab,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it\u2019ll make them more determined to choose their clothing freely.\u201d",
      "Already, Iranian officials appear to have acknowledged the reality that they cannot enforce the hijab law exactly as before.",
      "The morality police, whose officers once roamed the streets arresting women deemed to be violating the law \u2014 including ",
      ", the 22-year-old woman whose death in their custody set off mass protests \u2014 have disappeared from public. Still, other law enforcement units can enforce the law.",
      "That has all come as the authorities have tamped down the women-led protests that gripped Iran for months, through a heavy-handed security presence in cities and ",
      " accused of involvement in the protests.",
      "But public comments by officials demonstrate that even the conservatives in power disagree about how to handle the law now that many women have openly repudiated it.",
      "In a recent statement, the headquarters of Amr-e- be- Marouf, a conservative government-affiliated institute whose sole purpose is to enforce Islamic norms, said that the authorities\u2019 previous means of compelling women to wear the head scarf were \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cdefeated.\u201d The country needed to find \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cinexpensive\u201d ways to enforce it instead, it said.",
      "On the same day, Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf, the head of the Majlis, became the latest establishment figure to suggest some change was needed, saying that the government needed to prioritize Iran\u2019s ",
      " over any other concern.",
      "\u201cRegarding issues such as hijab and chastity,\u201d he said, the authorities should learn \u201cfrom all the methods that we used in the past\u201d and \u201cwe should review and think about it.\u201d",
      "For Shahnaz, 62, a teacher from Tehran who has also stopped wearing a head scarf in public, the government has no choice but to accept the new reality.",
      "\u201cWomen have made their decision,\u201d she said, asking to be identified only by her first name to avoid official repercussions. \u201cWe are not willing to go back from where we are now. History always moves ahead and there is no way to return.\u201d"

      "The building began convulsing at 4:17 a.m. Firat Yayla was awake in bed, scrolling through videos on his phone. His mother was asleep down the hall.",
      "The region along Turkey\u2019s border with Syria was known for earthquakes, but this apartment complex was new, built to withstand disaster. It was called Guclu Bahce, or Mighty Garden. Mr. Yayla\u2019s own cousin had helped build it. He and his business partner had boasted that the complex could withstand even the most powerful tremor.",
      "So, as the earth heaved for more than a minute, Mr. Yayla, 21, and his 62-year-old mother, Sohret Guclu, a retired schoolteacher, remained inside.",
      "At that very moment, though, Mr. Yayla\u2019s cousin, the developer, was leaping for safety from a second-story balcony.",
      "What Mr. Yayla and his mother had not known was that the system to ensure that buildings were safely constructed to code had been tainted by money and politics. That system prioritized speed over rules and technical expertise.",
      "A New York Times investigation found that a developer won zoning approval for the project after donating more than $200,000 to a local soccer club, where the mayor is an honorary president. Then, when residents raised alarms that the blueprints did not match what had been built, they received no satisfying reply from the local government. The building inspector said that, even after the project had failed its inspection, the developers used political influence to get the doors open.",
      "The apartment complex, in the southern Turkish city of Antakya, was a concrete and stone representation of a patronage system that has flourished under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he has propelled a construction boom across Turkey for the past two decades.",
      "Undeterred by warnings that the breakneck development lacked sufficient engineering oversight, officials in the capital, Ankara, gave local politicians more power to issue construction licenses for large projects without scrutiny from independent professionals.",
      "Basic suggestions never took off \u2014 that civil engineers should have to pass a certification exam, for instance.",
      "That building spree turned middle-class landowners like the Guclus, for whom the Guclu Bahce complex was named, into developers and landlords. Mr. Erdogan, ",
      ", used construction as a vessel for economic growth and a symbol of Turkey\u2019s progress. Local politicians from all parties benefited from the jobs, housing and off-the-books payments that commonly flowed from it all.",
      "Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office referred questions to the environmental ministry, which did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The ",
      " revealed the shaky foundation on which so much growth was built. More than 50,000 people died as ",
      ". Guclu Bahce, the mighty earthquake-proof complex, was among them. An estimated 65 people died there.",
      "\u201cSo many died because they were told that the safest place was inside, and they should not try to leave during an earthquake,\u201d said Fatma Oguz, whose sister died in the collapse.",
      "For the Guclu family, several of whom lived in the building, the collapse created a fatal rift. Survivors have turned on each other amid a lawsuit, a criminal investigation and a bitter search for answers:",
      "Were the buildings doomed to fall by nature of a powerful earthquake? Or did someone cut corners? Who can be held accountable in a system in which blueprints cannot be trusted and nobody agrees on whether the building passed inspection? The inspector says somebody forged his signature. It is unclear if the final project was up to code, and the developers cannot agree on who actually built anything.",
      "As the building shook in February, Mr. Yayla called out to his mother to stay in her room and get on the floor next to her bed. He did the same. They would ride this out safely.",
      "Then came a fierce thud, and the columns holding up the bedroom ceiling snapped.",
      "Family members say the land, covered in fig trees, had been theirs for three generations.",
      "By 2015, buildings were popping up all around, a testament to a Turkish economy that had been growing about 7 percent a year.",
      "Mehmet Guclu, a young developer with a civil engineering degree, approached his relatives with a plan. Look around, he told them. Somebody\u2019s going to develop this parcel. Better to keep it in the family, to be landlords, to make money.",
      "\u201cHe convinced us that he\u2019d build the most magnificent project in our family name,\u201d said Yusuf Guclu, another cousin who lived in the complex. He said that Mehmet had promised to protect against the earthquakes everyone in the region knew to expect.",
      "Mehmet Guclu, then in his 30s, was a charismatic striver with a luxe aesthetic, known for incorporating sleek finishes and expensive materials like marble. He had already built some of the tallest buildings in Antakya.",
      "The extended family had dreamed of exactly this opportunity for years.",
      "The complex was to be a centerpiece of the community \u2014 five towers, complete with luxury apartments, retail shops, a pool and a high-end gym.",
      "Mehmet\u2019s career had taken off quickly, in part because of Turkey\u2019s low barriers to entry for civil engineering graduates. Unlike in the United States and United Kingdom, graduates in Turkey do not need to pass certification exams or complete on-the-job training to become an engineer. Architectural trade groups have called for such requirements for years.",
      "\u201cUniversity educates you. It doesn\u2019t train you,\u201d said Mustafa Erdik, an earthquake engineering professor at Bogazici University in Istanbul. \u201cWe have to bring in professional engineering.\u201d",
      "Getting a project started often hinges on unwritten rules that can be as important as technical expertise. In this part of southern Turkey, for example, contractors have known for years that a donation to the local soccer club can move a project along, said Hikmet Cincin, the former head of the soccer club. Antakya\u2019s mayor at the time, Lutfu Savas, serves as the club\u2019s honorary president.",
      "After discussions with that mayor, Mehmet Guclu gave the club more than half a million lira, more than $200,000 at the time, according to a person involved in the construction process who spoke on condition of anonymity because of an ongoing investigation.",
      "Mr. Savas denied profiting from Guclu Bahce\u2019s construction and said the donation had not been tied to the project. \u201cIf we ask for money from our friends,\u201d he said of gifts to the soccer club, \u201cit\u2019s for the benefit of everyone.\u201d",
      "He called himself an honest politician in a corrupt system. He said developers commonly made payments to circumvent bureaucratic approvals. Most build whatever they want and assume it will be approved, he said. He blamed Mr. Erdogan and his political party for fostering this culture.",
      "But Mr. Savas, himself a former member of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party, was adamant that was not the case with Guclu Bahce.",
      "Mr. Savas says he has little memory of the particulars. What is clear is that the project rolled along in the following years, and the foundation was laid in summer 2017.",
      "But the earth in that part of Turkey is not ideal for building, particularly in an earthquake zone, said\u00a0Serkan Koc, a member of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects.",
      "\u201cThese areas shouldn\u2019t have been turned into construction zones,\u201d he said. Soft soil, for example, will amplify an earthquake. Mr. Koc said Turkish environmental officials should have assessed the whole area before the building boom.",
      "\u201cAlthough the ministry had the authority to inspect, they didn\u2019t\u201d he said. The environmental ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "As Mr. Guclu\u2019s new project moved forward, the only limitations seemed to be financial. Soon after the foundation was poured, his money dried up. He turned to a prominent developer, Servet Altas, to help see it through.",
      "Mr. Altas became the public face of the project. His initials, in red and blue, would later adorn the low wall ringing the complex.",
      "Sohret Guclu had been eager for a steady income to supplement her modest state pension. So she swapped her land deeds for ownership of six apartments and a retail storefront.",
      "She had raised two boys in an old, crumbling apartment building. Her new home was to be a four-bedroom unit with an airy living room and kitchen \u2014 one of the largest in the complex.",
      "Guclu Bahce\u2019s apartments were among the region\u2019s most expensive, costing as much as $160,000. But Mr. Altas promised upscale amenities and unparalleled safety, former residents said.",
      "\u201cIf there were an earthquake right now, I would run inside,\u201d Mr. Altas repeatedly said, recalled Ertugrul Sahbaz, a building manager for the complex.",
      "Guclu Bahce attracted doctors, teachers, judges and politicians. Songul Oguz and her husband bought a $117,000 apartment after a sales agent said that the building\u2019s strong foundation and reinforced steel bars could withstand even a 10-magnitude earthquake, Ms. Oguz\u2019s sister recalled. It would take 10 days for Ms. Oguz\u2019s body to be pulled from the wreckage.",
      "Mr. Altas, wearing a plaid jacket and bow tie, joined government officials for a jubilant opening ceremony in late 2019. They smiled and posed with a pair of 10-foot gold scissors that were later recorded by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest. Mr. Altas thanked Mr. Guclu for his engineering work and his own son for working as one of the architects.",
      "Few have argued that these developers knowingly put people in deadly buildings. Mr. Guclu\u2019s own family lived there, after all, as did Mr. Altas\u2019s son. Turkey deemed Mr. Guclu a qualified engineer, and the local government \u2014 measured by the number of officials at the grand opening \u2014 supported the project.",
      "But the chest-thumping and fanfare were premature. The buildings failed a final inspection, according to court testimony. The nature of the violations is murky, but Ismail Ozturk, a building inspector, testified this year that his company had raised concerns with the local authorities.",
      "Mr. Ozturk testified that the contractors had leveraged \u201cclose connections\u201d in the city government to overcome the failed inspection. The city mayor at the time, Ismail Kimyeci, who belongs to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party, denied any special treatment. He said the government\u2019s final approval had been a formality. \u201cThe inspection firm plays the most important role here,\u201d Mr. Kimyeci said.",
      "Mr. Ozturk\u2019s signature does appear on a certification document. Through his lawyer, he said it had been forged.",
      "In a functioning system, there would be no ambiguity about who had approved a project. But Turkey\u2019s system is built on ambiguity. The Erdogan government has, for decades, weakened independent, expert construction oversight and fought proposals to toughen standards.",
      "Turkey\u2019s chamber of civil engineers, for example, has argued for years that experienced engineers are stretched too thin to adequately supervise construction projects. The group has called for every project to get a dedicated engineer. That idea, which could have slowed down construction, went nowhere. The Erdogan government sued the group in 2015, blocking it from issuing its own, stricter certifications for engineers.",
      "Lawmakers also privatized the building inspection process, sidelining Turkey\u2019s engineering and architectural union. And while the government in 2019 eliminated a rule allowing contractors to pick their inspectors, mayors still hold power to push past potential issues.",
      "Guclu Bahce\u2019s opening was delayed. Discrepancies existed between the blueprints and what was built, Mr. Ozturk said in testimony after the earthquake. Some former residents, too, said that they had picked up on such differences and sent a letter to the city raising concerns.",
      "One resident said the dispute centered on the very building in which Mr. Yayla slept the night of the earthquake \u2014 the first to collapse. The resident said that the building had featured an extra floor, a penthouse with a terrace that had not appeared in the plans.",
      "The resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into a criminal and civil dispute, said he had helped broker a meeting between Mr. Altas and the city\u2019s current mayor, Izzettin Yilmaz, to find a solution.",
      "Mr. Yilmaz, a member of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party, acknowledged in an interview that he had met with Mr. Altas. But he said the purpose was to tell the contractor that he was not interested in taking bribes. Gossip was swirling, he said, and he wanted to make things clear: \u201cI told him: \u2018No one requested a payment from you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Through his lawyer, though, Mr. Altas, denied meeting with the mayor. What\u2019s more, Mr. Altas \u2014 who took credit at the opening ceremony for building the complex \u2014 now denies involvement with the construction or the planning. That was Mehmet Guclu\u2019s responsibility, he said.",
      "Despite claiming no involvement, Mr. Altas said he was certain that the complex matched the blueprints.",
      "There is no indication in Mr. Ozturk\u2019s testimony that anything was done to assess the design changes. Residents said the city promised to investigate, but they never heard back.",
      "Whether this discrepancy played any role in Guclu Bahce\u2019s collapse and whether the inspection was adequate are among many questions being asked in the government\u2019s criminal investigation and a family lawsuit.",

      "Quite.",

      ", in an elaborate\u00a0ceremony billed as an effort to bring modern flourishes to an ancient ritual, it is worth asking the question:",
      "Why, when nobody voted for the monarchy and half the population under the age of 50 ",
      ", does Britain still have one?",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons that the monarchy persists is that we don\u2019t often have serious conversations about why we have a monarchy,\u201d said Alastair Bellany, a historian at Rutgers University specializing in 16th- and 17th-century Britain. \u201cI think we should. I think a serious country has to look in the mirror. It\u2019s a lazy assumption that the monarchy is our message to Britain and the world that this is who we are.\u201d",
      "Of course, for many people, it would be difficult ",
      " as hard as that might be to articulate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just part of our lives, our tradition and our culture,\u201d said Penny Convers, a 64-year-old teacher who was interviewed as she enjoyed a few moments of rare London sunshine this week. \u201cMost of us just see them when they come on the TV,\u201d she said of the royal family, \u201cbut they are part of our British way of living.\u201d",
      "Not for Jude O\u2019Farrell, a 24-year-old pub manager from Southampton, England, who was visiting London for a job interview. He grew up in a house where his father often played \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d \u2014 ",
      ". (Sample line: \u201cShe ain\u2019t no human being.\u201d)",
      "\u201cThe monarchy doesn\u2019t really fit into my life at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just exists. ",
      "Still, you can\u2019t walk around Britain for more than five minutes without running into or experiencing something that shouts \u201cmonarchy\u201d: stamps, coins, bank notes, street names, pub names, consumer products bearing official royal insignia, the national anthem. ",
      "The Royal Albert Dock in Liverpool; the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary; the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama; the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall;",
      "\u201cThe Crown\u201d; the royal holidays. The list goes on.",
      "Sure, there are implacable anti-monarchy campaigners like ",
      " group, whose members regularly demonstrate at royal events. Recently, too, there have been increasing complaints from the former British colonies, which are demanding that the royal family ",
      " by formally apologizing and making reparations.",
      "But while the critics regularly surface with plausible grievances \u2014 the monarchy was built from the spoils of enslaved peoples; it is too expensive;",
      "it is racist, sexist, classist and out of touch; it automatically bestows power on people who can be shockingly unimpressive \u2014 those arguments have not gained serious political traction.",
      "Neither of the two main political parties, known as \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s government\u201d and \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s Loyal Opposition,\u201d supports ending the system.",
      "\u201cThe real question is not why they\u2019re a monarchy, since, obviously, the royal family isn\u2019t letting this go \u2014 they\u2019re the wealthiest and most powerful monarchy that still survives,\u201d said Brooke Newman, an associate professor of history, specializing in early modern Britain, at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cThe question is, why does the public continue to support them?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt boils down to emotional reasons,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat people feel this intense pride in having a historic family with an unbroken chain through history.\u201d",
      "One way the family has retained its power and aura, Ms. Newman said, is by obscuring the extent of its past connections to colonialism and slavery. \u201cThere are a significant population of people in the U.K. who are opposed to talking about this,\u201d she said.",
      "Craig Prescott, an expert in U.K. constitutional law and politics at Bangor University in Wales, said one of the monarchy\u2019s main functions is to transcend politics.",
      "Even at a time of national turbulence, in which four Conservative prime ministers in\u00a0seven years have presided over a fractious country rived by issues like Brexit, immigration and funding for the National Health Service, the monarchy can float above the fray, providing a kind of scaffolding that holds the system together.",
      "\u201cIt creates a space for politics which is separate from the state, beyond the touch of day-to-day politicians,\u201d Mr. Prescott said. \u201cThat means that no matter how feral and nasty politics can get, it\u2019s not about the state; it\u2019s about the government.\u201d",
      "\u201cPoliticians are here today, gone tomorrow, but\u201d he added \u2014 and here he sounded almost as if he were describing ",
      " in \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe monarchy persists.\u201d",
      "The monarchy is, in fact, tied to the will of the people, albeit indirectly\u00a0through the money flowing to the crown via Parliament, Mr. Prescott said. Parliament\u2019s political supremacy over the crown was established in\u00a0the 17th century, when the beheading of\u00a0King Charles I set the stage for a\u00a0short-lived republic. When the monarchy was\u00a0restored\u00a011 years later, Parliament\u00a0curtailed the crown\u2019s power through a Bill of Rights that ushered in a constitutional monarchy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s said that an ideal monarchy should always be changing and always be the same, maintaining tradition and keeping up with the times,\u201d said Tracy Borman, the author of \u201cCrown & Sceptre,\u201d a history of the British monarchy, and\u00a0the joint chief curator of the Historic Royal Palaces.",
      "\u201cI think it has evolved to make as much sense as it possibly can,\u201d she added. \u201cThat ability to adapt has been a saving grace of monarchy. Monarchies that refuse to adapt fall in dramatic fashion, like the French monarchy.\u201d (See also the Russian monarchy, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the exiled monarchies of Greece and other European countries.)",
      "One constant of the British monarchy has been the calls for its abolition, Ms. Borman continued. \u201cThroughout history, it\u2019s been very much a generational thing, with younger people as a whole having less interest than older generations,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, as they grow more mature, they become more interested. It\u2019s cyclical.\u201d",
      "Bob Morris, an expert on monarchies at University College London\u2019s Constitution Unit, said the British royal family\u00a0helped maintain the nation\u2019s interest by understanding the difference between\u00a0celebrity and royalty.",
      "\u201cCelebritization is about attracting attention to yourself; royalty is about giving attention to other people,\u201d he said.",
      "In the year before the pandemic, working royals made 3,000 visits across Britain, he noted, drawing attention to civic groups, local organizations and charities.",
      "One way the monarchy\u00a0holds on to power, said Mr. Bellany, the Rutgers historian, who is British, is through the deft use of pageantry and ceremony, particularly in uncertain times. Charles\u2019s wedding to his first wife, Diana, the Princess of Wales, took place in 1981, providing a spectacular distraction for a weary nation during a period of turmoil and division.",
      "Even knowing that, Mr. Bellany said, he found himself unexpectedly moved last fall as he watched ",
      ".",
      "\u201cPart of me was annoyed, and part of me was very mistrustful of what I was seeing,\u201d Mr. Bellany said. \u201cBut part of me thought: \u2018This is very well done. This is powerful theater.\u2019 I think we should never underestimate the power of that theater.\u201d"

      "The thunder of artillery echoes night and day over the mighty Dnipro River as it winds its way through southern Ukraine. With Russian and Ukrainian forces squared off on opposite banks, fighters have replaced fishermen, surveillance drones circle overhead and mines line the marshy embankments.",
      "Carving an arc through Ukraine from its northern border to the Black Sea, through Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, the Dnipro shapes the country\u2019s geography and economy, its culture and its very identity. And now it helps define the contours of battle \u2014 as it has for millenniums, a barrier and a conduit to warring Scythians, Greeks, Vikings, Huns, Cossacks, Russians, Germans and many more.",
      "Visiting towns and villages along the Dnipro a year after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion and ahead of a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive, Nicole Tung, a photographer for The New York Times, traveled a path marked by hope and horror, joy and sorrow.",
      "The Dnipro has always been Ukraine\u2019s great natural engine, supplying water, transport, power \u2014 and food. The fishing industry is crucial to Ukraine\u2019s domestic food market, with 80 percent of the annual catch coming from the Dnipro and its reservoirs, according to the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group.",
      "But fish stocks have been decimated by the war. After Russian forces damaged the Nova Kakhovka dam, the river dropped by about 1.5 meters (five feet) over the winter, Ihor Syrota, the head of the state company that manages Ukraine\u2019s hydropower plants, said in an interview. The water level hit a 30-year low \u2014 too low to sustain the fish population.",
      "Mykola Derebas, 54, a fisherman for over three decades, lost his job at the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. He cannot even catch enough fish now to feed his own family in the town of Malokaterynivka, near the city of Zaporizhzhia.",
      "\u201cNot being able to go fishing is almost like when a person loses their leg,\u201d Mr. Derebas said in late January. \u201cAll I hoped for when the war started was for it to be over, but I don\u2019t see how it will be finished anytime soon. All we can do is sit and wait.\u201d",
      "The dams along the Dnipro were once mighty symbols of Soviet prowess. \u201cCommunism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country,\u201d Vladimir Lenin famously declared in 1920.",
      "In 1932, Soviet engineers completed work on what was then the largest dam ever built in Europe, near the city of Zaporizhzhia \u2014 one in a cascade of dams and hydroelectric plants on hundreds of miles of the Dnipro, from north of Kyiv to Nova Kakhovka. In the 1980s, their successors built the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe\u2019s largest atomic power station, which now poses a particular risk as it lies in the line of fire.",
      "Over the past year, Moscow has repeatedly bombed the Dnipro power stations that Soviet leaders so proudly promoted as the key to prosperity. ",
      "While Ukraine is working to restore water levels on the Dnipro, they remain far below normal.",
      "\u201cOf special concern are large reservoirs along the Dnipro River, which are critical for energy production, cooling of nuclear power plants, sustaining agriculture and seasonal flow regulation,\u201d said a study ",
      ".",
      "The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is under Russian occupation, and British military intelligence ",
      " that Russian forces had \u201cestablished sandbag fighting positions on the roofs of several of the six reactor buildings,\u201d which \u201cincreases the chances of damage\u201d to the plant.",
      "While the situation there has sparked international alarm, other dangers have gotten less attention.",
      "One of the Soviet Union\u2019s largest processing plants for nuclear fuel sits near the river, outside the city of Dnipro \u2014 long neglected, though it holds an estimated 40 million tons of radioactive waste, according to a 2020 report by the Bellona Foundation, a Norwegian environmental group. Scientists have warned of an environmental catastrophe if the facility is shelled and waste contaminates the river.",
      "The conflict has already wrought untold damage.",
      "The study in Nature showed how in the first months of the war alone, Russian attacks on wastewater treatment facilities resulted in widespread pollution of waters. At the same time, the rivers and irrigation channels that both militaries use as natural fortifications \u201chave also become a burial place for military objects,\u201d like ammunition that can leak heavy metals and toxic explosives, with impacts that may last for decades.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelensky often quotes Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine\u2019s most famous poet, to rally his nation. In his 1845 poem \u201cTestament,\u201d a battle cry against Russian subjugation, Shevchenko wrote that he would not go to God until the Dnipro \u201cdelivers to the sea the spilled blood of Ukraine\u2019s enemies.\u201d",
      "Many Ukrainians would support that sentiment, but even during some of the war\u2019s darkest moments, Ukrainians have also found ways to celebrate life. That is particularly true in cities like Dnipro that have not been at the heart of the fighting, though they have suffered bombings and blackouts, and have given refuge to people fleeing horrors elsewhere.",
      "This winter, young actors and dancers from the Dnipro Academic Opera and Ballet Theater performed \u201cSorochinsky Fair,\u201d an operetta based on a story by the Ukrainian writer Nikolai Gogol. It is a love story centered on overcoming evil spirits, mixing Ukrainian folk traditions, crafts and humor.",
      "The war rages on along the river, scarring towns and villages, and Russia has often directed its fire at civilian areas, a reminder that when armies clash, civilians often pay the highest price.",
      "As the Germans invaded in 1941, Stalin ordered the destruction of the great Soviet dam in Zaporizhzhia, flooding a vast area and ",
      " according to military historians. In 1943, the Germans blew up the dam again, trying to slow the Soviet advance in the Battle of the Dnipro, one of the largest engagements of the war.",
      "Last fall, Ukrainian forces drove the invaders from the west bank of the lower Dnipro, including the city of Kherson and the farms and hamlets around it, but the Russians have continued to bombard the area. For Inna, 57, and her husband Mykola, 63, who live near the city of Kherson, that means days are centered around getting the cooking and cleaning done before noon, when the sound of incoming Russian artillery means it is time to move to their food cellar.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this home because I can\u2019t, mentally,\u201d Inna said this winter. \u201cThese are my walls, and if it\u2019s meant to be, it will be.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian authorities have ordered all residents on the river\u2019s west bank not to leave their homes this weekend, as Russian shelling of the region has intensified ahead of the looming Ukrainian counteroffensive. On a single day this week, Russian shelling killed at least 23 civilians.",
      "Rivers can \u201ctell the story of a nation\u2019s history and a people\u2019s experience,\u201d Roman Cybriwsky observed in his authoritative chronicle of the Dnipro, \u201cAlong Ukraine\u2019s River.\u201d",
      "The Dnipro tells a tale with \u201ca plentitude of national sorrow,\u201d he wrote, but also reveals moments \u201cuplifting and joyous,\u201d an observation that holds true even in wartime. In areas out of range of Russian artillery, the Dnipro remains a vital part of Ukrainian life. People flock to its banks to find moments of solace and reprieve.",
      "But everywhere, the savage toll of wars past and present is visible. The burial mounds of Scythian fighters killed thousands of years ago can be found near memorials to soldiers and civilians killed in World War II. At a graveyard outside the city of Dnipro, there is a section for soldiers killed in eastern Ukraine in 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea.",

      "In the first days of Sudan\u2019s war, the two university students felt helpless.",
      "They locked themselves into their apartment in the capital, Khartoum, glued to Twitter as the battle unfolded. They winced as the walls shuddered from blasts and gunfire, taking shelter in the corridor. They wondered where Sudan was going.",
      "On the fifth day, April 19, the phone rang: Someone needed a taxi.",
      "A senior United Nations official, a woman in her 40s, was trapped inside her home in an upscale neighborhood, the caller explained. Her situation was desperate. Pickup trucks mounted with machine guns stood outside her building, firing at warplanes that zoomed overhead. Black smoke was streaming into her apartment following an airstrike nearby. She had run\u00a0out of water. Her cellphone battery was down to 5 percent. Could they rescue her?",
      "The students, Hassan Tibwa and Sami al-Gada, in their final year of mechanical engineering, had a side gig driving a taxi. But this call wasn\u2019t a paying job \u2014 it was a mercy run. Mr. Tibwa phoned the woman. \u201cShe was screaming,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe had only a few minutes before her phone died. She was on her own.\u201d",
      "They jumped into Mr. al-Gada\u2019s car, a dinged, seven-year-old Toyota sedan, and set off into the city, horrified at its transformation. Bullet holes pocked buildings. Charred vehicles littered the streets. Fighters were everywhere.",
      "Crunching over bullet casings, they navigated a gantlet of check posts manned by jittery fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, some wearing bandages or limping. The fighters scanned the students\u2019 phones and peppered them with questions. It took an hour to travel four miles.",
      "\u201cWe went through hell,\u201d Mr. Tibwa said.",
      "They found the U.N. official, named Patience, alone at her apartment in an apparently deserted building. She had been hiding in her bathroom for days, slowly depleting three cellphones, she said, showing them a scatter of bullet holes in her living room wall.",
      "The students consoled her, wrapped her in an all-covering abaya robe, and devised a cover story: Their passenger was pregnant and needed to get to a hospital. They paused to say a prayer. \u201cWe knew that the moment we stepped out, there was no going back,\u201d Mr. Tibwa said.",
      "Forty-five minutes\u00a0and 10 check posts later, their Toyota pulled up outside the Al Salam, one of Khartoum\u2019s most expensive hotels, now a five-star refugee camp.",
      "Patience wept with relief. After collecting herself and checking in, she sat the students down to ask an urgent question.",
      "Could they go back and rescue her friends too?",
      "Over the following week, Mr. Tibwa, 25, and Mr. al-Gada, 23, rescued dozens of desperate people from one of Khartoum's\u00a0fiercest battle zones, according to interviews with the students, those they extracted and hundreds of text messages. Along the way they were robbed, handcuffed and threatened with execution. Fighters accused them of being spies. Diplomats implored them to retrieve their passports and pets. Shellfire and stray bullets fell around their car.",
      "\u201cThe bravery of these guys is just amazing,\u201d said Fares Hadi, an Algerian factory manager who survived a hair-raising ride with them\u00a0through Khartoum. \u201cSo impressive, so courageous.\u201d",

Ten passengers said the students had swooped to their aid at terrifying, life-threatening moments, when large organizations with drivers and security guards were nowhere to be found.",
      "\u201cThe only word for them is heroes,\u201d one U.N. official said.",
      "Like most U.N. employees interviewed, the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly criticizing an organization that, by many accounts, failed to rescue its own employees, even those facing immediate danger.",
      "\u201cDespite all the chaos, the fear, the bombing,\u201d he said, \u201cSami and Hassan were the ones who turned up.\u201d",
      "Even as Mr. Tibwa drove strangers to safety, his own family didn\u2019t know he was in Sudan.",
      "He arrived in 2017 from Tanzania, where his family runs a modest hardware store at a small town on Lake Victoria. An Islamic charity provided a scholarship to study engineering at the International University of Africa in Khartoum.",
      "But he told his parents that he was going to study in Algeria, in deference to their concerns about Sudan\u2019s history of violent unrest \u2014 a lie he easily maintained for six years, because he never had enough money to go home.",
      "Mr. al-Gada is Sudanese, but was raised in a sleepy town in northeastern Saudi Arabia, where his father was a car mechanic.",
      "Classmates in university, the two young men soon became friends. They shared a bright, open disposition and a gritty entrepreneurial streak, working odd jobs at night to make rent. Mr. Tibwa drove a taxi that catered mostly to African U.N. officials, with whom he also socialized.",
      "\u201cEveryone knew Hassan,\u201d said one Kenyan. \u201cAn outstanding gentleman.\u201d",

      "But when Mr. al-Gada went to\u00a0campus to\u00a0submit a paper, the guards sent him home. This\u00a0time it\u00a0was not a protest, they\u00a0said. It was war.",
      "Months of tension between Sudan\u2019s ruling generals exploded into gunfights between rival units that quickly spread to the city center, concentrated\u00a0around the military headquarters and the international airport.",
      "That zone also happened to abut two of Khartoum\u2019s most expensive districts: Khartoum 2, known as K2, and al-Amarat, which\u00a0were filled with embassies, U.N. offices and the homes of\u00a0foreigners and well-heeled Sudanese. The area also contained several R.S.F. bases. Fighters surged through its streets, taking up positions on rooftops, breaking into homes and, in some cases, robbing their occupants.",

      " inside\u00a0his house. A shell landed outside the British ambassador\u2019s front door but failed to explode. An American convoy came under fire.",
      "The United Nations, like most organizations, ordered its 800 employees and dependents in Khartoum to \u201cshelter in place.\u201d But although its security division rescued a handful of people in the first days of fighting, it soon stopped.",
      "The U.N. had only a few armored vehicles, which were shot at or stolen, several officials said. Drivers refused to work, effectively grounding the fleet. In a conference call on Day 6 of the fighting, the U.N.\u00a0security chief in Khartoum\u00a0told colleagues that his department could no longer rescue anyone.",
      "\u201cThe message was: \u2018You\u2019re on your own,\u2019\u201d said one of two senior U.N. officials who recounted that call.",
      "Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada were not the only rescuers. Local Resistance Committees, formed years earlier to push Sudan toward democracy, ",
      " to helping Sudanese and foreigners flee.",
      "But for some stricken residents, the two students were the only option.",
      "\u201cThey called us,\u201d Mr. Tibwa said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have food. They had no power. Their phones were going down. We tried to imagine ourselves in that same situation. So we went out.\u201d",
      "Hours after delivering Patience, the two\u00a0students received an S.O.S. from another U.N. official. The guards at her building had vanished, and the R.S.F.\u00a0had given residents three hours to get out.",
      "\u201cPlan to occupy the building,\u201d she texted, describing her predicament with an expletive. \u201cI\u2019m resigned to my fate.\u201d",
      "Eight minutes later Mr. Tibwa responded. \u201cWe are coming to pick you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI promise.\u201d",
      "Mr. al-Gada was less sure. It was nearly dark, and a fragile cease-fire was about to end. A tense argument ended with a decision to go, reluctantly. \u201cWe were not so happy with each other,\u201d Mr. Tibwa said.",
      "At the apartment they found more than they bargained for: about 15 people, including a Korean couple\u00a0with two children. They were being evicted, a U.N. official said, because the R.S.F. commander\u2019s second wife lived next door.",
      "A three-vehicle convoy pulled out, windows down to show they were transporting women and children. Fighting resumed in the city, with airstrikes and shooting.",
      "In the second car, Danielle Boyles, 27, a preschool teacher from South Africa, cowered under an abaya. At one checkpoint, a fighter threatened to shoot the Malawian U.N. official beside her. She started to tremble and pray.",

      "Reaching the Al Salam hotel, they piled out, exhausted.",
      "The Al Salam was known as the capital\u2019s political salon, a place where the rich, powerful and heavily armed wrangled over the future of Sudan. Luxury four-wheel drives with dark windows pulled up before its revolving doors. Militia leaders rubbed shoulders with Western diplomats over its $50 buffet. Negotiators from the African Union sipped coffee in the lounge. Mercenaries from Russia\u2019s Wagner private military company exercised in the gym.",
      "The war transformed the hotel. By Day 5, all 236 rooms and suites were occupied, the manager said, some sleeping six people to a room.",
      "Stray bullets punctured the lobby window and guest rooms. Guests filmed gunfights from the upper floors. Food had to be rationed. When a pitched battle erupted on Africa Street, outside the main gate, guests crowded into the basement and the gym locker rooms.",
      "Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada became fixtures in the lobby, flopping onto sofas after rescue runs. It was still Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, and they didn\u2019t eat or drink until sunset. Guests marveled that they kept making more rescues. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to eat much,\u201d said the wife of a senior U.N. official. \u201cI think they were just going on adrenaline.\u201d",
      "Some guests were local residents who had run directly to the Al Salam when the war erupted. They asked the two students to pass by their homes to collect passports, laptops or a pet dog and cat. The students entered the deserted home of the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Sudan, lighting their way with a candle and guided by a video call with a family member. They held their noses as they passed a fridge filled with rotting food.",
      "Mr. Hadi, the Algerian factory manager, had been using the hotel pool on his day off when the fighting started. The students drove him home to get his passport. But when a soldier at a checkpoint found something he thought suspicious in Mr. al-Gada\u2019s phone, chaos erupted. Guns were drawn and Mr. al-Gada quickly found himself face down on the street, a cocked Kalashnikov at his head.",
      "Mr. Hadi, watching from the back seat, braced for the worst. \u201cI was waiting for his brains to come on my face,\u201d he said.",
      "But Mr. al-Gada kept talking and, after a long 15 minutes, the fighter backed down. As the car rolled away, Mr. al-Gada was \u201csweating like hell,\u201d Mr. Hadi recalled. \u201cHe was terrified.\u201d",
      "The R.S.F. fighters could be friendly or frightening, and the student rescuers experienced both these faces directly.",
      "Formed in 2013 from the feared ",
      " that once terrorized the western region of Darfur, the R.S.F. has in recent years sought to rehabilitate its image. But few Sudanese can forget the group\u2019s participation in a massacre of over 120 democracy protesters in 2019.",
      "The R.S.F. has spread across Khartoum in recent weeks; Western officials estimate it controls 80 percent of the city. Some residents tell of being robbed or assaulted by R.S.F. fighters, while others say smiling fighters gave them\u00a0money\u00a0and assurances.",
      "As Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada drove back to their apartment on the sixth night of fighting, they said, R.S.F. troops stole from their car a cellphone and $1,100 \u2014 cash pressed on them by grateful passengers. When Mr. al-Gada reported the theft at the next checkpoint, an R.S.F. officer insisted on investigating it, even as fighting raged around them.",
      "With R.S.F. soldiers at the wheel of their car, Mr. Tibwa and Mr. al-Gada were driven back to the post where they had been robbed, then to a makeshift R.S.F. base at the back of the city airport. Scared, Mr. Tibwa sent his location to Patience and another U.N. official he had saved.",
      "The second U.N. official urged them to get out. \u201cPlease Hassan, I\u2019m begging you!!!!\u201d she texted.",
      "It was too late. Moments later, a\u00a0new\u00a0officer appeared, a scowling man who began treating the students as suspects, interrogating them and\u00a0placing them\u00a0in handcuffs.",
      "The episode ended hours later when, finally assuaged, the fighters freed the students, handed back $500 and insisted on escorting them home. On the way, the convoy stopped at a checkpoint where soldiers were eating a meal: a giant platter of camel meat and rice. They insisted the students join them.",
      "The R.S.F. commander gave them a bag of leftovers to take home and, days later, sent Mr. Tibwa a memento: a photo of their shared meal at 3 a.m. on the deserted streets of a shellshocked city.",
      "The students\u2019 final mission was their longest: a trip across the Nile to the city of Omdurman, at the request of Rwandan diplomats, to rescue a woman who, unlike the first they rescued, really was pregnant.",
      "As their Toyota approached the house, the woman, who gave her name as Fifi, texted them. \u201cAlhamdulilah,\u201d she wrote \u2014 the Arabic for \u201cpraise be to God.\u201d She was eight months pregnant, and had been stranded with her young son for 10 days.",
      "By then, an ",
      " from Khartoum was underway.",
      "A dramatic helicopter evacuation the previous night of the American Embassy, led by SEAL team 6 commandos, set off a cascade of evacuations. British, French and Turkish military aircraft landed at an airstrip north of Khartoum, leaving with diplomats and private citizens.",
      "Most of the people the students had deposited at the Al Salam finally left on a United Nations convoy of buses, cars and four-wheel drives that made a grueling 35-hour journey to Port Sudan, 525 miles away. From there, many took ships across the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The United Nations rejected criticisms, voiced privately by numerous staff members, that it had failed to protect endangered employees or to prepare for the war despite ample warning signs.",
      "The organization\u2019s Department for Safety and Security \u201cis not a protective service,\u201d a U.N. spokesman, Farhan Haq, said in an email. \u201cIt has neither the mandate nor the capabilities to perform systematic extractions or \u2018rescues.\u2019\u201d",
      "Asked if the United Nations intended to investigate any shortcomings, Mr. Haq wrote, \u201cIn any crisis situation, we always look for lessons learned.\u201d",
      "As the foreigners left, most of Khartoum\u2019s 5 million residents remained, sheltering in their homes and praying for a real cease-fire. The students stayed behind too, at first.",
      "\u201cKhartoum is getting empty now,\u201d Mr. Tibwa said from their apartment last week, the sound of gunfire rattling in the background.",
      "But a day later they were gone. A friendly R.S.F. commander had warned them that \u201csomething big was coming\u201d in the city center, Mr. Tibwa said. He advised them to get out while they could. They packed up the Toyota and drove 14 miles to the edge of the capital, where Mr. al-Gada\u2019s family has a house.",
      "For a few days they considered their options, working out, drinking coffee and reading novels (Mr. Tibwa started Paulo Coelho\u2019s \u201cThe Alchemist\"). Fighter jets scudded over the horizon\u00a0and a stray bomb landed nearby, killing members of a family in their home, they said.",
      "Mr. Tibwa wanted to stay in Sudan, a country he said he had grown to love \u2014 and where he was a single semester away from completing his engineering degree. But his time had run out.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. al-Gada dropped his friend on a street where he hoped to catch a bus to Ethiopia, and from there back to Tanzania.",
      "A personal reckoning loomed, Mr. Tibwa noted ruefully: Now his parents would learn that he had been studying in Sudan, and not Algeria, all along.",
      "As they separated, Mr. Tibwa pulled out his cellphone and began filming.",
      "\u201cSaying goodbye to my boy, Sami,\u201d he said as the Toyota rolled down the street, his partner waving through the window. \u201cSee you man. See you.\u201d"

    "name": "Russian Unease Over Ukraine War Grows Amid Attacks and Leadership Rifts",
    "author": "By Neil MacFarquhar",

      "With Ukraine stepping up attacks deep inside Russian-controlled territory, there were new signs on Friday of disarray and unease among Russia\u2019s military and political leadership as they brace for a looming Ukrainian offensive, for which their forces may be ill-prepared.",
      "The latest manifestation of those tensions came from Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner mercenary group, who used what he said were the newly bloody corpses of his fighters as the backdrop for another expletive-laced rant against the top military command. Not for the first time, he threatened to pull his fighters out of the long-embattled Ukrainian city of Bakhmut if the Ministry of Defense did not provide more ammunition.",
      "That was just one of a series of events that contributed to a sense that the war effort, and by extension the country, was adrift, even as Russia prepares to observe the biggest military holiday of the year next Tuesday.",
      "Two explosions ",
      " in the middle of the night on Wednesday, in what the Russians claimed was a failed drone attack by Ukraine. Denying the accusation, Ukraine said Russia might have done it to try to muster domestic support for a faltering war effort. No matter the culprit, symbolically it seemed to many to signal Kremlin weakness.",
      "That came in tandem with attacks on a number of oil storage facilities, igniting huge fires, and train derailments both near the border and well away from the battlefields, all attributed to Ukrainian drones or sabotage.",
      "Adding to the building sense of anxiety, the head of Russia\u2019s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, bizarrely accused the United States in an ",
      " of having started the war to seize territory ahead of a supposed cataclysmic explosion of a volcano at Yellowstone National Park, which he said would wipe out life in North America.",
      "\u201cEveryone is nervous, sitting on the edge of their seats,\u201d said Clifford Kupchan, a Russia specialist and chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk assessment firm. \u201cYou have the most revered Russian military holiday dovetailing with the coming Ukrainian offensive and all of these explosive events.\u201d",
      "The holiday, ",
      ", commemorates the Soviet Union\u2019s triumph over Nazi Germany, and in the last two decades President Vladimir V. Putin has transformed the military spectacle into a centerpiece of his rule.",
      "That ratchets up the stakes for Moscow, Mr. Kupchan said. \u201cIt is yet another cause of the high tension that we are seeing right now and the jitters on both sides,\u201d he added.",
      "Mr. Putin has remained silent, as he sometimes has in the past amid rapid-fire events. But he is under some pressure himself to rally the nation in his scheduled nationwide Victory Day speech. ",
      "\u201cThe longer Putin is silent, the more everyone will think that he is confused and does not know what to do,\u201d Abbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter turned political analyst, wrote on Telegram.",
      "In one sign of heightened security fears, Red Square, at the very heart of Moscow, and the venue for the viewing stands for the elite during the parade, has been closed to the public since the end of April. Numerous parades around the country are being scaled back or canceled.",
      "The one in Moscow, however, is expected to be the usual, carefully choreographed display of raw power, even if the reputation of the Russian military has been diminished. Some pro-war bloggers have lashed out at the business-as-usual parade, saying the men and weapons would be better deployed in Ukraine.",
      "Part of that is because so much is riding on the outcome of the anticipated Ukrainian drive.",
      "\u201cMany people see this offensive as decisive in the war,\u201d said Dmitri Kuznets, who monitors the military ",
      " for Meduza, an independent Russian website in Riga, Latvia. \u201cEveryone is very emotional and people\u2019s interpretation depends on their political views.\u201d",
      "In a sign of the growing anxiety, the Russian occupation authorities on Friday ordered civilians living near the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region, in southern Ukraine, to leave their homes and businesses.",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that this is a mandatory measure to ensure the safety of residents living in frontline territories,\u201d the Kremlin-appointed governor of the region, Yevgeny Balitsky, said in a statement. He also declared that he thought the offensive had already begun.",
      "Although many do not expect Ukraine to launch its attack until the spring ",
      " hardens in mid-May, various pinpricks inside Russia were seen by military analysts as designed to keep Russia from moving more forces toward the front lines.",
      "Russia accused Ukraine of using two drones to target the Kremlin this week, saying it shot them down within the fortress walls. In addition to the attacks on oil depots in Crimea, on Friday, drones hit a refinery in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia, Russian state media reported.",
      "Mr. Prigozhin has unleashed similar rants previously, but Mr. Putin has been loath to publicly rebuke either him or the top military leaders whom the mercenary leader denigrated \u2014 Sergei K. Shoigu, the minister of defense, and Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of staff of the armed forces. ",
      "Over the course of the war, Mr. Prigozhin and the generals have maneuvered bureaucratically and on the battlefield to gain the upper hand in directing the war and to win Mr. Putin\u2019s confidence. The president, in turn, has played the two sides off against each other to ensure, analysts say, that neither amasses too much power.",
      "There is evident pressure, spoken or unspoken, on Mr. Prigozhin and other commanders to produce some results to brag about for Victory Day. In one of his ",
      " on Friday, Mr. Prigozhin said that he had been expected to take Bakhmut by then, but had been foiled by \u201cmilitary bureaucrats\u201d who cut off the supply of artillery shells days ago.",
      "Mr. Prigozhin announced that his withdrawal would happen next Wednesday, the day after the holiday. His gory video and statements caused an uproar, with some critics accusing Mr. Prigozhin of \u201cblackmail,\u201d while others praised his courage. One pro-military blogger compared him to the hero of the movie \u201cThe Last Samurai,\u201d a warrior willing to sacrifice his own life \u201cin order for the emperor to open his eyes.\u201d",
      "Ramzan Kadyrov, the pugnacious leader of the Republic of Chechnya inside Russia, chastised Mr. Prigozhin for displaying the corpses of his men to create a public outcry, and offered to deploy his men in place of the Wagner mercenaries to finish the job in Bakhmut. He also chastised the Defense Ministry for logistical and supply issues.",
      "Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s threat to leave was not fully credited, seen as just another in a series of rash statements or a new attempt to capture Mr. Putin\u2019s attention.",
      "There was no immediate official reaction, but a previous outburst by Mr. Prigozhin did win him some of the ammunition and recruits that he wanted, although the numbers remain murky.",
      "Several Russia analysts said they expected the Defense Ministry to meet some of Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s demands this time, too, since there is no ready alternative to his estimated 10,000 men in Bakhmut.",
      "Both Ukrainian and American intelligence officials said they had seen no movements by the Wagner forces that suggested repositioning, and regarded Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s comments more as a sign of the chronic palace intrigue and bureaucratic maneuvering among the Russian leadership.",
      "\u201cI would strongly doubt that the Russians are going to withdraw from Bakhmut, so that is histrionics,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said.",

      "DUBONA, Serbia \u2014 The killer seemed to mark people for death at random. He drove to a halt at a soccer field near a Serbian farming village, where young people were enjoying drinks and music, opened fire with an assault rifle, and sped off. He fired on another group outside a schoolyard.",
      "Just one day after a 13-year-old shot to death nine people at his school in the capital, Belgrade, eight more victims lay dead or dying Thursday night, with at least 14 others newly wounded. Already deeply shaken, Serbia once again had to confront the unthinkable. This small Balkan nation, which had not had a mass shooting in seven years, had suffered two of them in as many days.",
      "Early Friday, after an overnight manhunt involving hundreds of officers, with helicopters swarming overhead, the police captured a man who officials said was the gunman, a 21-year-old wearing a white supremacist symbol. Neither the officials nor the people of the area could offer a coherent motive for the massacre.",
      "President Aleksandar Vucic vowed sweeping changes to Serbia\u2019s gun laws, saying he was aiming for the \u201calmost complete disarmament\u201d of the country, something rarely attempted \u2014 and a sharp contrast to the United States, where mass shootings have mostly been followed by official inaction. At a news conference on Friday he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been walking around like zombies the last 24 hours, looking for a reason something like this could happen.\u201d",
      "Serbia is already a remarkable outlier. It has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, partly a legacy of the Balkan wars of the 1990s that left deep physical and mental scars, and yet it does not have a high rate of gun violence.",
      "When he was caught, the suspected killer, a local man whose name was not released, wore a T-shirt that said \u201cGeneration 88,\u201d Mr. Vucic said, adding that it referenced a ",
      " for \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d It was not clear if the shooter had connections to any white supremacist groups, and people who knew him in his village said they were unaware of any such affiliation.",
      "Mr. Vucic said that when the suspect was asked the reason for his rampage, he gave a cryptic, one-word answer: \u201cdisrespect.\u201d",
      "The shootings took place in a sparsely populated region, about 20 miles southeast of Belgrade, where vineyards line the hillsides.",
      "On the outskirts of the village of Malo Orasje, the gunman shot to death five people and wounded six, the police ",
      " In the adjacent village of Dubona, they said, he killed three and wounded eight. Witnesses said the weapon appeared to be an automatic rifle.",
      "Then the gunman commandeered a taxi and forced the driver to take him to Vinjiste, a village about 40 miles to the south, where he was arrested, the police said.",
      "Nikola Mitrovic, one of those wounded in Malo Orasje, said he was hanging out with 10 friends on a small soccer field, drinking and listening to music, when the gunman pulled up in a black Mercedes car around 10:30 p.m.",
      "\u201cWe thought that somebody was making a joke on us,\u201d Mr. Mitrovic, 17, said by telephone from the hospital where he was being treated. \u201cHe started yelling \u2018Get on the ground!\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHe fired in bursts and whoever he hit, he hit,\u201d Mr. Mitrovic said. He said he managed to escape after the gunman emptied one magazine, before he loaded another and resumed shooting.",
      "Zlatko Vujic said his 25-year-old nephew was among those shot dead in Dubona. Mr. Vujic said the suspect, whom he knew, was the son of a veteran of the 1990s wars and had been working at a nearby fruit farm. The gunman \u201cwas just a kid,\u201d Mr. Vujic said, his voice quavering.",
      "Javorka Pavlovic, a resident of Dubona, said she heard gunshots late in the night but thought they were fireworks. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock,\u201d she said, standing near a shooting site where blood stained the pavement.",
      "President Vucic said the suspect\u2019s father is a deputy colonel in the Serbian Army. Police surrounded and searched the family home in the hamlet of Donja Dubona, just outside Dubona.",
      "Searches of the house in Vinjiste where the suspect was found, and a cottage he used in the village of Sepsin, near Dubona, yielded several weapons, the police said, including an automatic rifle without a factory number, a carbine with optics, a pistol and four hand grenades. They did not say if the rifle was the one used in the killings.",
      "Stefan Markovic, 29, a resident of Donja Dubona who said he had known the suspect since they were children, said the accused gunman\u2019s father had kept numerous weapons in the house. He described a family wedding he attended a few years ago, in which the suspect\u2019s father and other family members shot rifles into the air to celebrate.",
      "Many Serbs stockpiled weapons left over from the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, conflicts marked by a string of atrocities. Mr. Vucic began his political career in that era as a far-right nationalist. He is seen as having moderated somewhat since then, but his leadership is often described as ",
      ".",
      "Though Serbia\u2019s presidency is largely ceremonial, Mr. Vucic is the undisputed leader of the governing party. It is not clear how hard he will push his audacious gun control ideas, or which will be adopted, but the government has a history of acting on his wishes.",
      "He proposed a series of measures after the school shooting, some of which the government said it would enact immediately, including a two-year moratorium on new gun licenses and enhanced surveillance of shooting ranges.",
      "On Wednesday, a seventh-grade student in Belgrade, armed with two pistols and having prepared Molotov cocktails, fatally \u200b",
      " and a security guard at his school, and wounded six students and a teacher, the police said. It was the first mass shooting in Serbia since 2016.",
      "Prosecutors said on Friday that they had charged his father with a \u201cserious offense against general security\u201d for training his son to use firearms, and with violation of a law requiring that guns be kept locked up. The boy cannot be held criminally responsible because of his age, they said, but is being held for observation in a psychiatric institution.",
      "On Friday, after the second mass shooting, Mr. Vucic announced a stricter gun control agenda. To own a gun legally, he said, a person would have to pass a full audit, including psychological and drug screening. Of the roughly 400,000 legal, registered guns in Serbia, excluding hunting weapons, he said he expected just 10 percent, at most, to remain in private hands.",

      "The era of warm, wave-and-smile relations between the British monarchy and its distant realms has come to an end. Many of the former colonies that still formally swear allegiance to King Charles III are accelerating efforts to cut ties with the crown and demanding restitution and a deeper reckoning with the empire that the royal family has come to represent.",
      "Jamaica is moving rapidly toward a referendum that would remove King Charles as the nation\u2019s head of state, with a reform committee meeting regularly on the verdant grounds where colonial rulers and slave owners once lived. ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and nearly every other country with similar systems of constitutional monarchy have also signaled support for becoming republics completely independent of Britain in the years to come.",
      "The chorus of calls for British apologies, reparations and repatriation \u2014 of everything from ",
      " to ",
      " \u2014 has also ",
      ", placing the new king in a vexing position. Charles represents nearly 1,000 years of unbroken royal lineage; he also now stands on a volatile fault line between Britain, where much of that history tends to be romanticized, and a group of forthright former colonies demanding that he confront the harsh realities of his country\u2019s imperial past.",
      "\u201cThere is a growing gap between Britain\u2019s perception of its own empire and how it\u2019s perceived everywhere else,\u201d said William Dalrymple, a prominent historian of British India. \u201cAnd that gap keeps growing.\u201d",
      "For countries still constitutionally joined to the crown, Charles\u2019s coronation arrived with little fanfare, and some cringing discomfort.",
      "These nations are but a remnant. In the wave of decolonization that followed World War II, dozens of independent countries climbed out from under British rule, including India, Pakistan and Nigeria. During Elizabeth\u2019s seven-decade reign, which began in 1952, 17 former colonies left the monarchy\u2019s embrace to become republics \u2014 in most cases, with a president replacing the queen as head of state, usually in the ceremonial role previously played by the monarch (India) or with stronger executive powers (Kenya).",
      "The 14 nations yet to do so stretch from Australia and Papua New Guinea to Canada and Jamaica. In some places that call the new 74-year-old sovereign their king, like the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, there seems to be little interest in severing royal bonds. Oaths of allegiance have already been switched from queen to king in the courtrooms of remote capitals where wigs are still worn ",
      ".",
      "But for many royal subjects in faraway places, words like \u201chis majesty\u201d and \u201croyal\u201d \u2014 as in the Royal Australian Air Force \u2014 roll less easily off the tongue now that Britain is less dominant on the global stage, and now that the monarch is no longer Queen Elizabeth II, who often seemed as irreplaceable as Big Ben.",
      "A few governments have already endorsed a soft fade. Quebec passed ",
      " in December that made the oath of allegiance to the king optional for lawmakers. Australia also recently announced that its new five-dollar note would replace the portrait of Elizabeth not with Charles but with imagery celebrating the country\u2019s Indigenous heritage.",
      "But for critics of monarchy and empire, these are baby steps when bold leaps are needed.",
      "Nova Peris, an Aboriginal Australian Olympian and former politician who is a leader of the Australian Republic Movement, which aims to replace the British monarch with an Australian head of state, is one of many calling for a deeper reckoning with the past.",
      "English settlers justified seizing Australia by declaring it ",
      " \u2014 a Latin term for \u201cland belonging to no one.\u201d It was a slur used to justify dispossession, and the impact still lingers. No treaty has ever been signed between the Australian government and Aboriginal nations.",
      "Later this year, Australians will vote on a referendum that would give Indigenous Australians an advisory role in policies affecting their communities. And ",
      " that many hope a vote on becoming a republic will be next, arguing it would tilt the nation more toward its neighbors in Asia and help unify Australia\u2019s increasingly multicultural population.",
      "\u201cMonarchy is all about entrenched privilege, about rule by kings and queens over and above the Australian people,\u201d Ms. Peris said. \u201cIt has no place in a democracy.\u201d",
      "In Jamaica, the process of separation from \u201cMother England\u201d is further along, and more imbued with demands for restitution.",
      "The Caribbean island was a center of the trans-Atlantic slave trade; Jamaican leaders began calling for reparations from Britain a few years ago, along with ",
      ". After Queen Elizabeth died in September, Jamaica\u2019s prime minister announced that his government would seek to change the constitution and make Jamaica a republic.",
      "In March, a committee of lawmakers and international experts started gathering in Kingston to work out the details.",
      "Richard Albert, a committee member and the director of constitutional studies at the University of Texas at Austin, said that at the first meeting, the gravity of the moment clarified the challenges ahead. The group now meets regularly to discuss what question to ask voters in the referendum, what role the Jamaican head of state would play, and what other changes might follow becoming a republic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of national duty and pride,\u201d Mr. Albert said. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that the country wants to exercise self-determination to celebrate its cultural heritage, and to plant a flag to say: We are an independent sovereign state.\u201d",
      "Many Jamaicans have said they hope becoming a republic would lead to broader changes, with schools, courts and other institutions stepping away from quiet respect for British traditions and instead including more candid accounts of crimes committed by colonizers swearing loyalty to the British crown.",
      "On the campus of the University of the West Indies on a recent afternoon, many students described Charles as an unknown, distant figure \u2014 almost a cardboard cutout from the past.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy is something that should just stay in England,\u201d said Tamoy Campbell, who is studying law. \u201cFor us to move forward as a nation, it\u2019s important that we break away from those ties, to charter our own destiny, our future and our goals.\u201d",
      "Charles has said he does not object to such pursuits. Last June, at a meeting of the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 54 nations, almost all of which were once under British rule, he declared that any constitutional connection to his family \u201cdepends solely on the decision of each member state.\u201d",
      "He also noted that the group\u2019s roots \u201cgo deep into the most painful period of our history.\u201d ",
      "Last month, ",
      ", he signaled support for deeper research into the royal family\u2019s connections to slavery through the royal archives. Historians welcomed the move.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s quite a new step because the archives are private archives,\u201d said Robert Aldrich, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Sydney and co-author of \u201cThe Ends of Empire: The Last Colonies Revisited.\u201d ",
      "But how much can or will the king actually rectify?",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s constrained,\u201d Professor Aldrich said. \u201cHe must say and do only what is approved by the British government.\u201d",
      "British laws ",

      " the British government in the European Court of Human Rights. ",
      "\u201cThere is still a widespread sense of pride in Britain about an empire that is perceived as being a good and progressive force that brought railways, cricket and democracy to half the world,\u201d Mr. Dalrymple said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s very little awareness in Britain of the pile of skulls over which that was rolled.\u201d But there are hints of a shift. Books critical of British rule, such as \u201c",
      ", a British journalist born to Indian Punjabi parents, have become best-sellers. Mr. Dalrymple\u2019s book \u201cThe Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company\u201d will soon ",
      " that he has compared to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "For Charles, that means the realms he rules over may all soon become even more engaged with a sharper version of the history his family helped shape. And with that, his reign may be judged more critically than his mother\u2019s ever was \u2014 by British elites who believe much of their wealth came from their benign civilizing of a grateful world, and by former colonies that bear the scars of ",
      " and want their loot and patrimony returned.",
      "\u201cThere is friction now in a way that there simply wasn\u2019t as recently as five or 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Dalrymple said. \u201cWithin Britain, there\u2019s a whole lot of stuff that we don\u2019t know and that we haven\u2019t come to terms with.\u201d",

      "It may seem, at first blush, an unlikely connection: Leon Botstein, the president of Bard, one of the country\u2019s most progressive colleges, and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced billionaire accused of sexually abusing teenage girls.",
      "But ",
      " this week showed that Dr. Botstein did not just pursue Mr. Epstein hoping to raise money, he did so repeatedly. He made frequent visits to Mr. Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse, and Mr. Epstein and his entourage hopped by helicopter to Bard\u2019s lush campus in the Hudson Valley.",
      "Dr. Botstein said in interviews with The New York Times that the visits were all about funding for Bard \u2014 for the school\u2019s commitment to social justice, its prisoner education program, its liberal arts mission. Bard calls itself \u201ca private college for the public good.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what this job is,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou cannot pick and choose, because among the very rich is a higher percentage of unpleasant and not very attractive people. Capitalism is a rough system.\u201d",
      "In defending his pursuit of Mr. Epstein and candidly describing the burden of raising money, Dr. Botstein gave insight into how the need to attract dollars can appear to run headlong into an academic institution\u2019s stated values.",
      "Mr. Epstein gave prolifically to many charities and universities, including Harvard and M.I.T., and the Wall Street Journal report showed that his network of contacts was wider than had been thought, including prominent figures like the linguist Noam Chomsky and ",
      ", the former Treasury secretary and president of Harvard. Dr. Summers sought money for a poetry foundation, led by his wife, Elisa New, a Harvard literature professor. Mr. Summers declined to comment.",
      "\u201cWould we accept money from Jeffrey Epstein today? No,\u201d Dr. Botstein said, describing the former donor as a \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201ctruly evil man.\u201d \u201cWe had no idea, the public record had no indication, that he was anything more than an ordinary \u2014 if you could say such a thing \u2014 sex offender who had been convicted and went to jail.\u201d",
      "Mr. Epstein had been very publicly accused of ",
      ". However, he had minimized his legal exposure with high-powered lawyers, settlements that silenced complaints, and a plea deal that short-circuited an F.B.I. investigation.",
      "Bard College, about 100 miles north of New York City, was having a difficult time after the 2008 financial crisis. By 2016, a financial ratings agency had ",
      " Bard\u2019s economic outlook, partly because the college had little cash.",
      "After Mr. Epstein gave Bard an unsolicited $75,000 gift in 2011, Dr. Botstein said that he hoped for more donations. The Times had ",
      " the gift.",
      "\u201cA guy sent us money, and we followed up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple story.\u201d",
      "Over the next four or so years, The Wall Street Journal reported, there were two dozen or so visits scheduled with Mr. Epstein, mostly at the financier\u2019s Manhattan townhouse. Mr. Epstein visited Bard to attend an opera in 2013 and a concert in 2016, planning to bring his young female assistants and arrive by helicopter, according to the newspaper.",
      "In an interview, Dr. Botstein said he never witnessed young female assistants around Mr. Epstein, that he was not present when Mr. Epstein\u2019s helicopter arrived, and that he did not remember whether he had met Mr. Epstein during those visits, which he said occurred during the summer when classes were not in session.",
      "Dr. Botstein said that it was his duty to raise money for the liberal arts institution he leads, in a time when the country is not adequately funding higher education. Bard has a small alumni base, he said, so a large part of his job is persuading wealthy people who are not affiliated with the institution to give money.",
      "\u201cThat is a humiliating experience to go back over and over and over,\u201d Dr. Botstein said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re completely at the mercy of the very wealthy.\u201d",
      "At first, developing a relationship with Mr. Epstein did not seem far afield for Bard, according to Dr. Botstein. Bard has a program for convicted felons, and Dr. Botstein said that the campus believes in second chances.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of our educational mission,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t criticize a priest for giving communion to a convicted felon.\u201d",
      "College presidents must often mingle with unsavory characters to raise money, said Stephen Trachtenberg, a former president of George Washington University. During his tenure, Mr. Trachtenberg said, he considered accepting donations from Scientologists and from the Libyan strongman, Col. Muammar Gaddafi, but ultimately rejected them.",
      "In an interview, Mr. Trachtenberg, now 85, said he never regretted his decision regarding Gaddafi, but still wonders whether he made the right call with the Scientologists, who he said wanted the university to confer an honorary degree on their founder, L. Ron Hubbard, a George Washington alumnus.",

      "No such gifts came from Mr. Epstein. Visits with him would always be done in less than half an hour, Dr. Botstein said. And aside from Mr. Epstein\u2019s donation of 66 laptop computers, efforts to extract money from him proved unsuccessful.",

      "More than half of the bogus Georgia electors who were convened in December 2020 to try to keep former President Donald J. Trump in power have taken immunity deals in the investigation into election interference there, according to a court filing on Friday and people with knowledge of the inquiry.",
      "In addition, Craig A. Gillen, the former deputy independent counsel in the 1980s-era Iran Contra scandal, has been hired to represent a fake elector who could still face criminal charges, David Shafer, the head of the Georgia Republican Party. Mr. Gillen specializes in cases involving racketeering, which is among the charges being weighed by Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga.",
      "Ms. Willis\u2019s office has spent more than two years investigating whether the former president and his allies illegally meddled in the 2020 election in Georgia, which Mr. Trump narrowly lost to President Biden. A special grand jury that heard evidence in the case for roughly seven months recommended more than a dozen people for indictments, and ",
      " with The New York Times in February that Mr. Trump was among them.",
      "Ultimately, it will be up to Ms. Willis to decide which charges to seek before a regular grand jury, which she has said she will do after a new jury is seated in mid-July. Her case is focused in part on a plan to create the slate of electors pledged to Mr. Trump in the weeks after the 2020 election despite Mr. Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia.",
      "Lawyers for the electors have argued they were simply trying to keep Mr. Trump\u2019s legal options open, though when they met on Dec. 14, 2020, ",
      " had all affirmed Mr. Biden\u2019s win there.",

      " the special grand jury\u2019s final report, most of which remains sealed.",
      "In April, Ms. Willis sought to have Kimberly B. Debrow, then a lawyer for 10 of the 16 Trump electors, thrown off the proceedings. According to a motion filed at the time by Ms. Willis\u2019s office, some of the electors recently told prosecutors that Ms. Debrow and another lawyer, Holly Pierson, had not informed them of offers of immunity in exchange for cooperation that prosecutors made last year.",
      "Ms. Debrow responded with her own filing on Friday, in which she called the accusation \u201ccompletely without merit\u201d and said she had made her clients fully aware, in writing, of what she called \u201cgeneralized potential offers of immunity.\u201d",
      "Ms. Pierson, who along with Mr. Gillen represents Mr. Shafer, has called the district attorney\u2019s assertions \u201centirely false.\u201d Both Ms. Debrow and Ms. Pierson have been paid by the state Republican Party.",
      "Ms. Debrow\u2019s new filing also revealed that eight of her clients had been offered immunity deals and that all of them had accepted. At least one additional elector who is not represented by Ms. Debrow also has a deal in place, according to people with knowledge of the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the investigation is ongoing.",
      "Ms. Debrow said in her filing that two clients had not been offered immunity deals and now had new lawyers, though she did not name the clients. A recent filing from Cathy Latham, a fake elector for Mr. Trump who was the Republican Party leader in rural Coffee County, Ga., revealed that she now has her own representation.",
      "Ms. Latham played a key role ",
      " to access voter data in her county after the 2020 election \u2014 another point of scrutiny in the investigation.",
      "While all of the fake electors had long been identified by prosecutors as targets who could face criminal charges, three have been considered particularly vulnerable by those with knowledge of the investigation: Mr. Shafer, Ms. Latham and Shawn Still, a Georgia state senator who filed and later withdrew a lawsuit related to the vote count in Coffee County.",
      "Mr. Still did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Ms. Willis\u2019s office declined to comment. Her office alleged in a filing last month that some of the Trump electors have accused another of illegal conduct.",
      "But in her motion, Ms. Debrow called the allegation \u201ccategorically false.\u201d She added that the court \u201cneed not take defense counsel\u2019s word for the fact that none of the electors incriminated themselves or each other \u2014 these interviews were recorded.\u201d",

Mr. Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold, according to Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner.",
      "The killing, on an F train in Manhattan, has led to investigations by both the police and prosecutors, a spokesman for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg said. As of Wednesday afternoon, nobody had been arrested.",
      "\u201cAs part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the Medical Examiner\u2019s report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible, and obtain additional medical records,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s spokesman said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis investigation is being handled by senior, experienced prosecutors and we will provide an update when there is additional public information to share,\u201d he added.",
      "On Monday, a man who was riding in the same subway car went up to Mr. Neely, a 30-year-old ",
      " who was yelling that he was hungry and ready to die. The 24-year-old man who choked Mr. Neely has not been identified.",
      "The episode, filmed on a nearly four-minute video that shows other riders helping to pin down Mr. Neely while others looked on, has led to a police investigation and spurred advocates for the homeless, ",
      " and others to call for an arrest. Gov. Kathy Hochul said she needed to review the incident more closely but called the man\u2019s death troubling.",
      "\u201cIt was deeply disturbing,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "The incident comes as the city grapples with how to reduce both crime and the number of people with mental illness living on the streets, while also respecting the rights of its most vulnerable residents. The two issues have become the twin focuses of Mayor Eric Adams, who has sent more police to patrol train stations and to sweep homeless encampments even as he has supported policies that offer a ",

      "Any criminal case could come down to whether the man who placed the rider in a chokehold was justified in using force, according to legal specialists.",
      "Under New York law, a person may use physical force on another person if they have a reasonable belief that it is necessary to defend themselves or others. But a person can only use deadly physical force if they have reason to believe that an attacker is doing or about to do the same.",
      "The police and prosecutors must determine what the intentions of the rider were when he grabbed Mr. Neely, if the rider felt physically threatened and if other passengers believed they had a reason to fear for their safety, said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cThe D.A.\u2019s office is going to do a painstaking investigation where they are going to interview every witness and look at the video frame by frame,\u201d she said.",
      "The police, who questioned the 24-year-old man and let him go on Monday night, said that they were investigating the death. A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney said that they were also investigating.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation confirmed Mr. Neely\u2019s identity, although the police have yet to do so.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams called the death \u201ctragic,\u201d and said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what happened here.\u201d He added, \u201cHowever, we do know that there were serious mental health issues in play here, which is why our administration has made record investments in providing care to those who need it and getting people off the streets and the subways, and out of dangerous situations.\u201d",
      "There were signs that the debate about the outcome had already begun. On CNN, the mayor urged caution, rebutting a statement by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that Mr. Neely had been \u201cmurdered.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s very responsible at the time where we\u2019re still investigating the situation. Let\u2019s let the D.A. conduct his investigation with the law enforcement officials.\u201d",
      "Homeless advocates stood behind the victim. \u201cThere was no empathy on that train car,\u201d said Karim Walker, an organizing and outreach specialist at the Urban Justice Center, who works with people who are homeless. There should be accountability for the death of Mr. Neely, he said.",
      "\u201cHe did not need to nor did he deserve to die in the manner that he did,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThat\u2019s what really scares me and that\u2019s what really breaks my heart.\u201d",
      "Witnesses said that Mr. Neely was acting in a \u201chostile and erratic manner\u201d toward other passengers on the train, according to the police.",
      "Juan Alberto Vazquez, a freelance journalist who was riding on the train and who shot the video, said the victim was yelling about being hungry and thirsty. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t mind going to jail and getting life in prison,\u2019\u201d Mr. Vazquez recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m ready to die.\u2019\u201d",
      "That kind of language might have led other passengers to believe that Mr. Neely was going to do something violent, said Todd Spodek, a criminal defense lawyer.",

      "\u201cThose bystanders may have felt threatened by the victim, but they were not in fact attacked by him,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, they watched him die.\u201d",
      "Left-leaning politicians called the death of Mr. Neely, who was Black, ",
      "\u201d by the other rider, who appeared to be white.",
      "Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker, said in a statement that the legal system\u2019s initial response to Mr. Neely\u2019s killing was disturbing, and put \u201con display for the world the double standards that Black people and other people of color continue to face,\u201d adding: \u201cThe perceptions of Black people have long been interpreted through a distorted, racialized lens that aims to justify violence against us.\u201d",
      "Mr. Vazquez said it did not appear as if Mr. Neely was suffocating, but after learning he died, he became troubled by what he had seen on the train.",
      "The reaction of bystanders reflects what can happen to many when they witness a crisis, said Lee Ann DeShong-Cook, assistant professor of social work at Juniata College.",
      "They \u201cwere experiencing various levels of fight, flight or freeze,\u201d she said, adding, \u201chad someone simply offered the homeless man a bottle of water or a snack he might have been able to calm down, re-engage his rational brain and would still be alive today.\u201d",
      "Workers from the Bowery Residents\u2019 Committee, which does homeless outreach in the subways, had known Mr. Neely since 2017, according to a person familiar with his history with social services.",
      "A team had spotted him on the subway as recently as March 22. He appeared to be struggling with both mental illness and substance use disorder, according to his records. At one point, he lived at a safe-haven shelter, which has more privacy and fewer restrictions than other shelters.",
      "Until recent years, the subway was where Mr. Neely had felt happy and free to perform as a dancer, said his friend, Moses Harper, an artist who met Mr. Neely in 2009, when he was 16 years old.",
      "Mr. Neely would dress up as Michael Jackson during his \u201cThriller\u201d stage and ride the trains, moon-walking in front of commuters.",
      "Mr. Neely and Ms. Harper, who also impersonates Michael Jackson, bonded over being street artists. Ms. Harper said she lost touch with Mr. Neely until she saw him again on a cold day in 2016, walking through subway cars with his head down.",
      "The two left the station and walked several blocks together, talking. She gave him her shirt, some food, and told him where she lived.",
      "Ms. Harper said she urged him to come find her when he was ready to get help.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get it together,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the last time I saw him.\u201d",
      "Emon Thompson, 30, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, said she first saw Mr. Neely about two weeks ago at around 1 a.m. after she boarded an F train in Lower Manhattan.",

    "name": "Legal Moves in Trump Case Reveal Challenges of Prosecuting a President",

    "body": [
      "A month after the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office unveiled criminal charges against Donald J. Trump, the complexities of prosecuting a former president and current contender for the White House are becoming increasingly clear.",
      "On Thursday alone, a flurry of activity at what was supposed to be an ordinary court hearing illustrated that reality.",
      "The state court judge overseeing the case tentatively scheduled the trial for early next year, in the thick of the presidential primary calendar. The judge also acknowledged Mr. Trump\u2019s role as a presidential candidate who has a right to defend himself \u2014 but granted a request from prosecutors to restrict Mr. Trump\u2019s public comments about the evidence against him. And the former president\u2019s lawyers announced that they would try to move the case to federal court \u2014 arguing that as a former federal officeholder, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s right to be tried there.",
      "The hearing crystallized the delicate balance between treating the former president like any other defendant, and acknowledging the reality that he stands alone, as the first former president to face criminal charges.",
      "At one point, the judge,\u00a0Juan Merchan, fiercely questioned one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers about whether the former president, \u201cshould be held to a different standard than all of the other defendants who come to this courtroom?\u201d",
      "But a moment later, the judge seemed to answer his own question. \u201cObviously Mr. Trump is different,\u201d he said, noting the defendant\u2019s dual role as former president and presidential candidate. \u201cIt would be foolish of me to say he\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The challenge for Justice",
      "Merchan will be to weigh the unique nature of Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s role against the principle that the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, cited last month in a news conference announcing the charges: That everyone stands equal before the law.",
      "John S. Martin Jr., a former federal prosecutor and judge, said that the reality of Mr. Trump\u2019s role as a former president and current candidate could not be ignored. He said that Justice Merchan needed to think about when it might be appropriate to restrict Mr. Trump\u2019s privileges as a political candidate.",
      "Any restrictions placed on Mr. Trump \u201calmost have special significance, because they impact him as they would not impact anyone else,\u201d Mr. Martin said, adding, \u201cYou\u2019re impacting his ability to do something he has every right to do, which is run for president.\u201d",
      "In that context, even something as routine as setting a trial date becomes fraught. Justice Merchan on Thursday asked prosecutors and Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers to decide on a date in February or March of 2024. That means the trial will likely take place in the midst of the primary contests of next year\u2019s presidential election, when Mr. Trump\u2019s courtroom travails would surely become a key feature of media coverage on the campaign trail.",
      "The charges against Mr. Trump stem from his first presidential campaign, during which his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid $130,000 in hush money to a porn star, Stormy Daniels. After his victory, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen, personally signing nine of the 11 checks used to repay him.",
      "Mr. Trump\u2019s family business, the Trump Organization, then falsely recorded in the company\u2019s records that the payments were made for legal services, prosecutors say.",
      "In March, the former president was indicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. When the charges were made public, prosecutors and defense lawyers said that they were nearing an agreement on certain restrictions that would be placed on Mr. Trump\u2019s access to case material, and his ability to talk about the prosecution\u2019s evidence.",
      "But the parties could not agree. The district attorney\u2019s office asked Justice Merchan to limit Mr. Trump\u2019s access to some case material and to bar him from spreading the prosecution\u2019s evidence publicly, including on social media. Lawyers for Mr. Trump balked at that request, saying that any restrictions placed on their client should also be placed on Mr. Bragg and his prosecutors.",
      "On Thursday, Justice Merchan sided with prosecutors, saying that the order that he would issue should apply to Mr. Trump, and that there was no reason it should also apply to the district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "Still, he emphasized that Mr. Trump would remain free to speak about the \u201cvast majority of the evidence,\u201d saying his expected order would only apply to evidence that the prosecution had obtained itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to do everything I can to be as narrow and focused here as I can possibly be,\u201d the judge said.",
      "A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, nonetheless announced at the end of the hearing that Mr. Trump would seek to move his criminal case from New York State Supreme Court to federal court.",
      "The effort to move the case to federal court is likely to be a long shot and will not have any immediate effect. ",
      "Such requests are rarely granted in criminal cases, and a spokeswoman for Mr. Bragg said prosecutors would file an appropriate response.",
      "Mr. Trump\u2019s effort hinges on a little-utilized provision in federal law that allows for defendants, within 30 days of their arraignment in state court, to submit \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds\u201d for having their case moved to federal court.",
      "The basis for the request is ",
      " that allows some former federal officials who are indicted in state court to have their cases switched to federal court. To qualify for that provision, according to legal experts, Mr. Trump must be facing charges for conduct related to his presidency, which is up for debate.",
      "Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that because he is accused of falsifying records that were created while he was in the White House \u2014 Mr. Cohen was reimbursed over the course of many months in 2017 \u2014 the case meets that test.",
      "\u201cThis case is unprecedented in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d his lawyers wrote in the notice of removal, adding that, \u201cNever before has a local elected prosecutor criminally prosecuted a defendant either for conduct that occurred entirely while the defendant was the sitting president of the United States.\u201d",
      "But several legal experts said on Thursday that just because he is accused of committing a crime while in the White House, does not mean the crime was related to his presidency.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s welcome to try but its unlikely he\u2019ll have any success,\u201d said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney who is now a University of Alabama law professor. She said that the relevant law would \u201cobviously\u201d not come into play given that the conduct wasn\u2019t within the scope of Mr. Trump\u2019s official duties.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump might have little to lose in seeking a fresh start with a federal judge, particularly given his history in Justice Merchan\u2019s courtroom. Last year, the judge presided over the Trump Organization\u2019s unrelated tax fraud trial, in which the company was found guilty by a jury. And Justice Merchan, a former prosecutor, is known to impose tough sentences in white- collar cases.",
      "But on Thursday, the judge assured the courtroom that he was being fair.",
      "\u201cI have to apply the law to him as I see it and in that regard I\u2019m bending over backwards and straining to make sure that he is given every opportunity possible to advance his candidacy and to be able to speak in furtherance of his candidacy,\u201d Justice Merchan said."

      "A video of a subway rider choking and killing a homeless man on a New York City train lasted for four minutes.",
      "What happened may seem clear to a layperson viewing the footage.",
      "The homeless man, Jordan Neely, is seen writhing, trying to get free from the arms and legs of the other subway riders who are pinning him down. As the minutes tick by early Monday afternoon on a northbound F train in Manhattan, Mr. Neely visibly weakens as the ",
      ".",
      "After he stops moving, the riders hold him down for about 50 more seconds. He was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.",
      "But Mr. Neely\u2019s attacker has not been arrested or charged with a crime, raising questions about how such cases are processed by New York\u2019s legal system and angering many left-leaning politicians and activists who have called the process racist. They have asked why the subway rider, who appeared to be white, was not kept in custody, and argued that were he Black, he would have been.",
      "Law enforcement officials say the specific sequence of events and the laws that may come into play make any potential criminal case more complex than the video would suggest.",
      "Mr. Neely, a Black man, had been screaming at passengers when the other rider put him in a chokehold for several minutes, until he went limp. He died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold, according to a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, who ruled his death a homicide on Wednesday. (That ruling means that the other passenger killed Mr. Neely, but is not a finding of legal culpability.)",
      "On Thursday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York called the video of Mr. Neely\u2019s death \u201chorrific\u201d and said \u201cthere have to be consequences.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt became very clear he was not going to cause harm to these other people,\u201d Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, said after an unrelated event in Manhattan. \u201cThe video of three individuals holding him down until the last breath was snuffed out of him, I would say was a very extreme response.\u201d",
      "The man who choked Mr. Neely, a former marine who has not been identified, is being represented by Raiser and Kenniff, a Manhattan law firm whose founding partners were both in the armed services.",
      "Thomas Kenniff, who was the Republican candidate for Manhattan district attorney in 2021, said that the firm had been in contact with the district attorney\u2019s office and the Police Department about the incident, but did not have any further comment.",
      "The rider who choked Mr. Neely was interviewed by the police and released, and a person familiar with the matter said the rider is not viewed by the authorities as a flight risk. ",
      "If he is charged by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, the man who applied the chokehold would most likely argue that the force he used against Mr. Neely was justified. Prosecutors would have to prove that he used deadly force without having believed that Mr. Neely was also using deadly force or was about to.",
      "And in order to show those things in court, prosecutors would need to have interviewed every one of the many witnesses to the encounter, to make sure that none of them would say something that would hurt the prosecutors\u2019 case. Prosecutors do not typically bring cases unless they believe they can win them.",
      "New York law imposes multiple deadlines on prosecutors once they have charged someone with a felony. Under New York law, a defendant in custody who has been charged with a felony must be released within a strict time limit unless the district attorney wins an indictment from a grand jury and alerts the court to that indictment or the defendant has consented to a delay.",
      "A second time limit, which governs a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial can also come into effect after an indictment, though it does not apply in most cases in which a defendant is accused of a homicide.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said it was still looking at a variety of factors.",
      "\u201cAs part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the medical examiner\u2019s report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible and obtain additional medical records,\u201d Doug Cohen, a spokesman for the office, said in a statement.",
      "In a ",
      " on Thursday, the police asked for the public\u2019s help in identifying witnesses they can interview. Prosecutors have also encouraged witnesses to come forward.",
      "In the video, two other riders are seen helping to pin down Mr. Neely while the former marine had his arms wrapped around his neck. Other passengers looked on.",
      "The responses of the people in the subway car and of law enforcement officials have prompted fury among some New Yorkers about the death of a Black man at the hands of a man who appeared to be white.",
      "\u201cThe initial response by our legal system to this killing is disturbing and puts on display for the world the double standards that Black people and other people of color continue to face,\u201d the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, said in a statement.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams called Mr. Neely\u2019s death \u201ctragic,\u201d but urged patience as officials complete the investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what happened here,\u201d he said earlier in the week.",
      "When charges are brought hastily when a full investigation has not been conducted, they can be subject to second-guessing.",
      ", the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office was compelled to drop a murder charge against a bodega clerk in Harlem who fatally stabbed an attacker in his store. The clerk, Jose Alba, 61, was initially charged by Mr. Bragg\u2019s office with second-degree murder.",
      "Mr. Alba had argued with the girlfriend of the man he killed, Austin Simon, 35, over paying for snacks for her 10-year-old daughter. Mr. Simon went behind the bodega\u2019s counter and shoved Mr. Alba.",
      "Charges filed against Mr. Alba were criticized in some news outlets, as public pressure against the district attorney\u2019s office mounted. Mr. Adams expressed support for Mr. Alba, saying at the time that New Yorkers should not fear being attacked at their place of employment. \u201cThere is a line that must be drawn when you are a primary aggressor, and that is what I saw on the video,\u201d he said. ",
      "Both the Adams and Hochul administrations have been using a variety of tactics they say are meant to reduce crime and the number of people who are mentally ill and living on New York\u2019s streets.",
      "The mayor has increased the number of ",
      ", directed mental health professionals and the police to ",
      " \u2014 against their will if necessary \u2014 and ",
      " homeless encampments. But the mayor ",
      " have also pushed gentler strategies, including ",
      " that serve people with mental illness in streets and shelters.",
      "Juan Alberto Vazquez, a freelance journalist who shot the video inside the subway car, said that Mr. Neely had been yelling about being hungry and thirsty. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t mind going to jail and getting life in prison,\u2019\u201d Mr. Vazquez recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m ready to die.\u2019\u201d",
      "Another rider who had encountered Mr. Neely a couple of weeks earlier said he had seemed upset, but had calmed down when she offered him a few dollars. She said he had thanked her \u201cfor five minutes.\u201d",

      "Detective Troy Patterson\u2019s body was slid into a waiting hearse on Friday, 33 years after he last patrolled the New York City streets.",
      "He was a 27-year-old officer then, and a prolific one. In his six and a half years on the New York Police Department force, he was responsible for over 150 arrests, according to Edward A. Caban, the department\u2019s first deputy commissioner, who spoke at the funeral ceremony.",
      "He specialized in gun crime at a time when New York was at its nadir: In 1990, there were 2,245 homicides, the highest recorded number in the city\u2019s history. And on Jan. 16 of that year, Detective Patterson nearly became among the first victims. ",
      "As he washed his Nissan Maxima near his home in Brooklyn, he was confronted by a small group of men. They tried to rob the officer, who was off-duty; the teenager accused of being the gunman, Tracy Clark, then 15, was seeking $20 to join a local basketball league, the ",
      ".",
      "Detective Patterson was shot in the head, critically wounded. Doctors removed the bullet from his skull, but he remained in a semivegetative state for over three decades, cared for at first by his mother, Katherine Patterson, for 17 years until she died from complications from multiple sclerosis, according to reports. He was ",
      ", and was most recently cared for by his aunt, the family said.",
      "Detective Patterson died on April 29, never emerging from his coma. Yet he laughed on occasion, and seemed to know when his family was with him, his son, Troy Patterson Jr., has said.",
      "Mr. Patterson was 5 years old when his father was shot. Speakers recalled the detective\u2019s love for his Nissan, which he took meticulous care of, and how only his young son was allowed to violate the many rules he applied to this beloved car. He let Troy Jr. stand on the armrest and pop his head out the sunroof on father-son joy rides.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Patterson, now nearly 40, recalled seeing his father in the intensive care unit at Kings County Hospital as a child. \u201cI used to wonder, why can\u2019t he walk? Why can\u2019t he talk?\u201d he said at the funeral. \u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of police officers, many wearing their dress uniforms and white gloves, lined Park Place outside First Church of God in Christ in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn on Friday morning. They included members of the 60th Precinct, where Detective Patterson had been stationed, police motorcycles, a police band and even police dogs.",
      "Mayor Eric L. Adams, a former police officer, recalled the visits he made with fellow officers to Detective Patterson\u2019s bedside, and to a memorial where he was shot. He reminded mourners of the environment that eventually claimed the detective\u2019s life: streets that he said were filled with violence, crack cocaine and \u201cpeople waking up to gunshots and not alarm clocks.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut men like Troy stayed,\u201d the mayor continued. \u201cThey didn\u2019t flee.\u201d",
      "Some civilians also attended the funeral, listening to the eulogies over loudspeakers on the street. Tricia Clairmont, 54, an educator, had heard about the ceremony on the news that morning. She stood outside the church on Friday dressed in funeral attire, at times with damp eyes.",
      "Ms. Clairmont applauded the herculean efforts to keep Detective Patterson alive, even without hope of his recovery. \u201cHe was still breathing through it all,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a miracle. That\u2019s still a miracle.\u201d",
      "Retina DeFreitas, 69, a retired health care worker, had stumbled upon the funeral when she stepped outside her home. She stayed for the entire ceremony. She was sad for the family\u2019s loss, but happy, in a way, for the detective, she said. \u201cI think he is with the Lord \u2014 he suffered enough.\u201d",
      "He died at Hartwyck at Oak Tree, a rehabilitation center in Edison, N.J. The exact cause of death is still being determined.",
      "Mr. Adams remembered how difficult the visits to New Jersey were, and how he and others tried to \u201cput on a good face.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we left the room, we left that meeting, for 33 years, all of us would sit in our cars privately and just uncontrollably cry while we watched such an energetic, joyful, good man live his life in that manner,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Clark, the accused gunman, was acquitted of attempted murder, but convicted of assault and attempted robbery. Two accomplices, Vincent Robbins, then 20, and Darren Crawford, 17, were convicted on similar charges. ",
      "Some in law enforcement, including Paul DiGiacomo, the president of New York City\u2019s Detectives\u2019 Endowment Association, have called for upgraded charges following the death. A spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney said the case was being reviewed.",
      "As Detective Patterson\u2019s coffin was removed from the church on the shoulders of six police officers, the mayor put his hand on his heart. Three police helicopters flew over in a tight triangle formation. They dipped so low they appeared to almost skim the Crown Heights brownstones."

      "When E. Jean Carroll testified this week in the ",
      " against Donald Trump, it was a certain iteration of feminism \u2014 a style incubated in the 1990s, as game and buoyant as it was repressive \u2014 that had fallen under review. Now 79, Ms. Carroll did not come of age amid the contemporary trauma discourse. As other women of her generation often did, she chose to declutter her mind of distressing experiences rather than maintain an active and all-too-painful inventory.",
      "For a long time, when Ms. Carroll would talk about the violent turn that she said occurred after what seemed like a serendipitous encounter at Bergdorf Goodman with the city\u2019s best-known real estate developer, she had been hesitant to use the word \u201crape.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked the word \u2018fight,\u2019\u201d she told the courtroom. \u201cI felt it gave me action. It wasn\u2019t something done to me.\u201d",
      "She was ",
      ", the former president\u2019s lawyer, whose Chevy Suburban masculinity stood out against the crisp economy of her sophistication. On Monday morning, she had arrived at the courthouse in a fitted navy blazer with a Nehru collar and dark glasses beneath her bangs that lent her an Anna Wintour-ish self-assurance \u2014 the essence of a woman who was not easily derailed.",
      "It was this image that Mr. Tacopina sought to make dispositive. His cross-examination aimed to sow suspicion of his client\u2019s accuser on the grounds that her public persona offered little indication of whatever grief she was suffering over the assault. (Mr. Trump elected not to appear in court and denies the attack took place.)",
      "In clips presented by the defense \u2014 from interviews with Anderson Cooper, among others, around the 2019 publication of Ms. Carroll\u2019s book \u201cWhat Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,\u201d where the allegations at the center of the case were made \u2014 she appeared effervescent, animated, well-suited to a publicity tour.",
      "The contention was, in effect, that she was having too much fun: emailing with Kathy Griffin, getting dinner invitations from ",
      " and Mary Trump, still shopping at Bergdorf Goodman so long after the fact. Hadn\u2019t her life been \u201cfabulous\u201d in recent years? Mr. Tacopina asked. And if it had been \u201cfabulous,\u201d the implication went, how then could it also have been as debased and depleted as Ms. Carroll\u2019s testimony suggested?",
      "It was a strategy that seemed to rely, however precariously, on the presumption of social and psychological deficits among jurors who would struggle to recognize that behind a facade of glamour and ambition lay a well of private torment.",
      "Long before we were fully submerged in the world of the disintegrated self, witnessing millions of individual exercises in Instagram PR that so often mask less enviable realities, Ms. Carroll was deeply invested in keeping the negative vibes undercover. \u201cI will always reply that my life is fabulous,\u201d she said in her testimony. \u201cIf I walked into a courtroom today and you said, \u2018How are you E. Jean?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018Fine, fabulous,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI always say I\u2019m fine. I put up a front.\u201d",
      "The following day, her close friend, the writer ",
      ", further detailed this approach. Taking the witness stand, she recalled that Ms. Carroll had phoned her immediately after the alleged incident with Mr. Trump \u201cbreathless, hyperventilating, emotional,\u201d but that the subject did not come up between them again for another quarter century. \u201cMs. Carroll is a very up person; she is not a victim,\u201d Ms. Birnbach said. \u201cInstead of wallowing, she puts on lipstick, dusts herself off and moves on.\u201d",
      "Before the eruption of the #MeToo movement, this had served as the operating mode for generations of women who felt they had little recourse to address the injustices they faced at the whims of predatory men.",
      "Ms. Carroll\u2019s legal team also called Jessica Leeds, the former stockbroker, now 81, who came forward several years ago to accuse Mr. Trump of groping her on a flight to New York in the late 1970s. Assuming nothing would come of any complaint, she too had tucked the episode away \u2014 a kind of sublimation with which the three women on the jury, all in their 50s and 60s, might find themselves familiar.",
      "In the mid-1990s, decades after the sexual revolution, nearing the declining days of the AIDS crisis and the heyday of elite media, New York seemed to belong to women like E. Jean Carroll. Having grown up in a red brick schoolhouse in Indiana, she became a cheerleader, a beauty queen, a feminist Hemingway \u2014 she claimed to be the first woman to walk from Telefomin in Papua New Guinea, over the mountains to the border of Irian Jaya \u2014 and then, like all the Sister Carries and Carrie Bradshaws before and after, she was an aspiring star who arrived in the city to impress, to beguile, to create, to experience all the stories, to tell them, to miss out on nothing.",
      "In interviews over the past few years, Ms. Carroll has talked about how ",
      " it was to bump into Donald Trump in a revolving door at Bergdorf\u2019s, when aimless luxury department-store shopping was still a cherished pastime. This was an anecdote she imagined she would \u201cdine out\u201d on forever. Almost nothing would have compelled her to say, \u201cSorry! Running out!\u201d when he asked her to help him pick out a gift for a woman he knew. The prospect was too dishy. A pair of big media personalities \u2014 Ms. Carroll was a well-known advice columnist by then \u2014 meeting so unexpectedly to do something vaguely conspiratorial. It could have easily supplied the opening scene of a Nora Ephron movie.",
      "At the outset, the story seemed so paradigmatically \u201cNew York,\u201d Ms. Carroll explained in her testimony. Until it wasn\u2019t."

      "The man who choked Jordan Neely to death on a New York City subway train on Monday is Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old veteran of the Marine Corps.",
      "Mr. Penny has not been charged in Mr. Neely\u2019s death and it is unclear if he will be. Many politicians, city leaders and advocates for New Yorkers struggling with homelessness and mental illness have called for his arrest. Mr. Neely\u2019s death, they said, was an unnecessary tragedy that underscores the city\u2019s inadequate policies toward its most vulnerable and marginalized residents. Some New Yorkers have also said that Mr. Penny\u2019s actions reflect the frustration and fear many riders have about the transit system, even as the rate of major felony crimes on the subway has fallen.",
      "On Friday evening, lawyers for Mr. Penny expressed condolences on behalf of their client to Mr. Neely\u2019s family. \u201cDaniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death,\u201d the law firm of Raiser and Kenniff said in a statement.",
      "The firm said, \u201cWhen Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived.\u201d",
      "Lennon Edwards, a lawyer for the family of Mr. Neely, said in an interview on Friday that Mr. Neely\u2019s death was unacceptable. \u201cHe was robbed of his life in a brutal way by someone who decided that they were judge, jury and executioner on the spot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have vigilantes, and we can\u2019t have people taking the law into their own hands.\u201d",
      "Mayor Eric Adams called Mr. Neely\u2019s death \u201ctragic,\u201d but urged patience as officials completed the investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what happened here,\u201d he said earlier this week.",
      "This is what we know so far about the case.",
      "The police said they received a call at 2:27 p.m. on Monday about a fight on an F train at the Broadway-Lafayette Street subway station in Manhattan.",
      "Shortly before that, Mr. Neely had boarded the northbound train at the 2nd Avenue station, said Juan Alberto Vazquez, a freelance journalist who recorded a nearly four-minute video that captured the moments when Mr. Penny was holding Mr. Neely in a chokehold.",
      "Mr. Neely immediately began screaming, causing people who were sitting near him to move away, Mr. Vazquez recalled. Mr. Neely said he was hungry and thirsty and took off his jacket, throwing it down on the ground.",
      "\u201c\u2018I\u2019m tired already,\u2019\u201d he said, according to Mr. Vazquez. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t care if I go to jail and get locked up. I\u2019m ready to die.\u2019\u201d",
      "It is unclear if Mr. Penny said anything to Mr. Neely at that point. Mr. Vazquez said he did not see him grab Mr. Neely, but that he heard a thump and then saw both men on the floor. The train stopped at Broadway-Lafayette, where it remained standing while Mr. Neely was pinned down, as two other men grabbed his arms and legs.",
      "At 2:29 p.m., another passenger can be heard in the video saying that his wife had been in the military and knew about chokeholds, and warning the men that they should make sure Mr. Neely had not defecated on himself.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to catch a murder charge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got a hell of a chokehold, man.\u201d",
      "The men then placed Mr. Neely, who was motionless, on his side. A transit worker can be heard over the loudspeaker calling for the police.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d the passenger who had given the warnings said. \u201cHe ain\u2019t gonna die.\u201d",
      "The police have not responded to messages asking what time they arrived at the scene. The Fire Department said it received a call for help at 2:39 p.m. and arrived at 2:46.",
      "Mr. Neely was taken to Lenox Health hospital in Greenwich Village, where he was pronounced dead, the police said.",
      "The medical examiner\u2019s office said on Wednesday that the cause of death was compression of the neck, and ruled Mr. Neely\u2019s death a homicide.",
      "Mr. Neely was a dancer and artist known for his impersonation of Michael Jackson during his \u201cThriller\u201d stage. He would dress up as the musician and ride the trains, moon-walking in front of commuters.",
      "The subway was where he felt happy and free to perform as a dancer, his friends said.",
      "But it was also clear that he was struggling. A friend, Moses Harper, recalled seeing him in 2016 walking through subway cars with his head down.",
      "Ms. Harper said she gave him her shirt and some food and told him where she lived, urging him to come find her when he was ready to get help.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get it together,\u2019\u201d she said in an interview earlier this week. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the last time I saw him.\u201d",
      "At a protest over Mr. Neely\u2019s killing on Thursday, demonstrators remembered seeing him perform. One man recalled being on a date once when his girlfriend stopped to watch Mr. Neely dance in Union Square.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker: I know him,\u201d said the man, Rashid Littlejohn. \u201cI gave him money.\u201d",
      "John Rich, a subway performer, said he and Mr. Neely had danced together a few times.",
      "\u201cHis glittery socks always matched his gloves,\u201d Mr. Rich said, grinning at the memory. \u201cHe was serious about his outfit, serious about dancing.\u201d",
      "Mr. Penny is being represented by Raiser & Kenniff, a Manhattan law firm whose founding partners were both in the armed services.",
      "He was interviewed by the police and released on Monday. A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Penny was not viewed by the authorities as a flight risk.",
      "His lawyer, Thomas Kenniff, who was the Republican candidate for Manhattan district attorney in 2021, said that the firm had been in contact with the district attorney\u2019s office and the Police Department about the incident.",
      "In a ",
      " on Thursday, the police asked for the public\u2019s help in identifying witnesses they can interview. Prosecutors have also encouraged witnesses to come forward.",
      "If Mr. Penny is charged by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, ",
      " that he used deadly force without having believed that Mr. Neely was also using deadly force or was about to. Mr. Edwards and his partner, Donte Mills, the lawyers for Mr. Neely\u2019s family, said that witnesses had told them that Mr. Penny came up behind Mr. Neely and grabbed him.",
      "The district attorney\u2019s office said it was looking at a variety of factors before deciding whether to issue charges.",
      "\u201cAs part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the medical examiner\u2019s report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible and obtain additional medical records,\u201d Doug Cohen, a spokesman for the office, said in a statement.",
      "The investigation is being led by Joshua Steinglass, a veteran homicide prosecutor, the district attorney\u2019s office confirmed. Mr. Steinglass helped lead the trial team in the case against Donald J. Trump\u2019s family business.",
      "Public defenders have said that law enforcement\u2019s approach to filing charges in the case of Mr. Neely\u2019s killing is atypical and that many people arrested in New York City are not afforded the same consideration.",
      "\u201cPolice and prosecutors almost never apply the level of scrutiny to cases that they are extending in this instance,\u201d said Eli Northrup, the policy director for the criminal defense practice at the Bronx Defenders. \u201cThe practice is to arrest and charge first, ask questions later, especially when the person being arrested is Black, brown or poor.\u201d",
      "There have been several protests in the wake of Mr. Neely\u2019s death, including one at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Thursday night, when about 100 demonstrators walked down the street, blocking traffic, toward the 7th Precinct in Manhattan, where Mr. Penny was questioned on Monday.",
      "\u201cMan murders a man on the train. Chokes him to death,\u201d Hawk Newsome, a founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York, said to the crowd at Barclays.",
      "\u201cPolice arrest him and decide, within hours, that they wouldn\u2019t charge him,\u201d Mr. Newsome said, adding, \u201cThey let him go.\u201d",
      "Wallace Mazon, 28, said the killing reminded him of George Floyd, who was killed when a police officer in Minneapolis put his knee on his neck and kept him pinned down for nearly nine minutes.",
      "He cried when he saw the video of Mr. Neely dying.",
      "\u201cI kind of felt hopeless,\u201d Mr. Mazon said. \u201cI just wanted to be in community with other people and not feel so helpless.\u201d",
      "Other New Yorkers interviewed on the subway have expressed more ambiguous sentiments and even sympathy for Mr. Neely\u2019s killer.",
      "Maria Casta\u00f1o, 64, an interior designer who lives in Brooklyn, said she viewed the man who choked Mr. Neely as a hero and Mr. Neely as the recipient of justice.",
      "\u201cI feel sorry for the man, but he was acting threatening,\u201d she said.",
      "Ayden James, 28, who is Black and a trans woman, said she knew what it was like not to feel safe on the subway.",
      "\u201cThe train is always a scary place,\u201d Ms. James said during Thursday\u2019s demonstration. But she added that Mr. Neely did not seem threatening.",

      "\u201cTrue with stars that they can grab women by the pussy?\u201d Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, asks.",
      "\u201cWell, that\u2019s what \u2014 if you look over the last million years, I guess that\u2019s been largely true,\u201d Mr. Trump says. \u201cNot always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, as the trial concluded its second week, Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers rested their case.",
      "The defendant has been absent throughout, but he still loomed over the proceeding in federal court. He has been cited in testimony, photographs and legal arguments. And over two days this week, he appeared in a different form, as Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers played for the jury excerpts from a video deposition they had taken of Mr. Trump in October.",
      "In the video clips, he sits at a table, dark-suited and solemn, answering questions posed by Ms. Kaplan. He calls Ms. Carroll \u201ca wack job,\u201d \u201csick\u201d and \u201ca nut job\u201d and turns his disdain on Ms. Kaplan, calling her a \u201cpolitical operative\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and insulting her to her face.",
      "At one point, he is asked whether he ever contacted Bergdorf Goodman after Ms. Carroll\u2019s allegation to gather evidence that would disprove her.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have to reach out to anybody, because it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Trump says. \u201cIt\u2019s the most ridiculous, disgusting story. It was just made up.\u201d",

      "Almost as soon as the video of one subway rider choking another to death began to ricochet across the internet, the killing came to signify more than the tragic death of one man.",
      "For many New Yorkers, the choking of the 30-year-old homeless man, Jordan Neely, was a heinous act of public violence to be swiftly prosecuted, and represented a failure by the city to care for people with serious mental illness. Many others who lamented the killing nonetheless saw it as a reaction to fears about public safety in New York and the subway system in particular.",
      "And some New Yorkers wrestled with conflicting feelings: their own worries about crime and aggression in the city and their conviction that the rider had gone too far and should be charged with a crime.",
      "Now, as prosecutors continue to investigate the circumstances of Mr. Neely\u2019s death, the case has become a political Rorschach test, dividing the city along long-simmering fault lines.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two of the city\u2019s most prominent Democrats, criticized each other\u2019s response in an uncommonly tense exchange. The death of another Black man in a chokehold \u2014 this time at the hands of a civilian \u2014 prompted ",
      ", the City Council speaker, over racism in the legal system.",
      "And in a city where disturbing subway encounters are a fact of life, many wrestled with uncomfortable questions about how they might respond when faced with a person who is both frightening other riders and obviously in crisis.",
      "The debate over how best to help people with mental illness is taking place in cities across the nation and has been particularly vexing in liberal cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, where homelessness and mental illness soared during the pandemic and people in dire need are often in plain sight on park benches and subway trains.",
      "These cities have sought out innovative solutions to assist those with mental illness \u2014 pouring money into ",
      " \u2014 and have also cleared subway homeless encampments, and weighed harsher tactics.",
      "In the wake of Mr. Neely\u2019s death, the debate has become especially heated. After Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter that Mr. Neely had been \u201cmurdered\u201d and another left-leaning official, Brad Lander, the city comptroller, called his attacker a \u201cvigilante,\u201d Mr. Adams called their comments irresponsible in an interview on CNN on Wednesday night.",
      "Mr. Adams, a former transit police officer in his second year as mayor, said on Thursday that he would wait to weigh in until the police and the prosectors had investigated what happened.",
      "\u201cThere are many layers to this,\u201d he said at an unrelated news conference. \u201cLet the process follow its course.\u201d",
      "On the F train in Manhattan on Monday, Mr. Neely, a subway performer and dancer who also had a history of mental illness and erratic behavior, had been yelling at passengers, saying he was hungry and thirsty, but also at ",

      "There is no indication that he was violent or that he made any direct threats.",
      "But one of the train\u2019s riders, a former marine who has not been identified by officials, approached Mr. Neely, ",
      ", and held him until he became limp.",
      "It does not appear that any riders intervened to help Mr. Neely; at least two other riders appeared to help pin him down. Mr. Neely was later pronounced dead at a hospital in Greenwich Village. Law enforcement officials are still investigating the incident and have not yet decided whether to charge the man.",
      "Asked what New Yorkers should do in a similar situation, Mr. Adams focused on Mr. Neely\u2019s presence on the train, and did not discourage people from seeking to restrain someone.",
      "\u201cWe need to be extremely clear that from Day 1 of this administration, I focused on: We cannot have people with severe emotional illnesses on our subway system,\u201d he said.",
      "Every New Yorker has a story of witnessing an outburst or a violent episode on the subway and struggling over how to respond: To confront or flee; to intervene when two riders are at odds; to call for a police officer, or to look away.",
      "Many have grown worried about safety on the subway after experiencing violence or reading about it in the news. Others are so accustomed to conflict that they ignore it.",
      "On Thursday at the Broadway-Lafayette station in Manhattan, where Mr. Neely was removed from the train and taken to a hospital, David Alexander, 45, a superintendent who lives in Manhattan, said that he avoided volatile subway riders and would not risk intervening himself.",
      "\u201cIf I see something happen, I get up and go to the next car,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t get involved \u2014 you could end up hurt, you could end up killed.\u201d",
      "Rahnuma Tarannum, 25, a data analyst who lives in Brooklyn, said that she felt so unsafe on the subway that she carried pepper spray.",
      "Though it is unclear if there were police officers nearby or on the train, Ms. Tarannum said that while she deeply regretted Mr. Neely\u2019s death, the incident supported her belief that the police need to be doing more.",
      "\u201cBecause police are not doing their job, that\u2019s why the citizens of New York are taking the law into their hands,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody has to do something.\u201d",
      "Mr. Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul have vowed to make the subway safer after a series of violent episodes, including stabbings and fatal shoves, that have often involved homeless people attacking others. ",
      "Crime rose on the subway during the pandemic, but the subway is ",
      ", when there were more than two dozen murders in a single year. There were 10 murders on the subway last year, compared with about two murders per year, on average, in the five years before the pandemic.",

      "The mayor\u2019s mention of mental health services was \u201cespecially rich\u201d coming from an administration that is \u201ctrying to cut the very services that could have helped him,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.",

    "name": "Jan. 6 Rioter Gets 14 Years for Police Attacks, Longest Sentence Yet in Inquiry",
    "author": "By Alan Feuer and Zach Montague",

      "A Pennsylvania welder who attacked police officers at the Capitol with a chair and then chemical spray was sentenced on Friday to slightly more than 14 years in prison, the most severe penalty handed down so far in connection with the events of Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "At a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington, the man, Peter Schwartz, 49, joined a growing list of people charged with assaulting the police on that day who have received stiff sentences. Until now, the longest sentence in a Jan. 6 case had been ",
      ", a former New York City police officer who was ",
      " last year of swinging a metal flagpole at an officer at the Capitol.",
      "The sentence could presage more long prison terms to come. In a separate case on Friday, prosecutors recommended 25 years in prison for Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, who was ",
      " in November along with one of his lieutenants. The prosecutors said holding Mr. Rhodes accountable at his sentencing hearing, scheduled for May 24, would be essential to preserving American democracy. His punishment, they said, could help decide whether \u201cJan. 6 becomes an outlier or a watershed moment.\u201d",
      "In the case of Mr. Schwartz, who went to the riot armed with a wooden tire knocker, prosecutors had asked Judge Amit P. Mehta for a sentence of 24 years and six months in prison \u2014 more than twice Mr. Webster\u2019s sentence. While Judge Mehta declined to go that high, he said that his decision to issue a term of 170 months was necessary given Mr. Schwartz\u2019s substantial history of violent offenses, and lack of remorse for his actions.",
      "\u201cThere are not many who have come before this court with a criminal history like yours,\u201d Judge Mehta said.",
      "Mr. Schwartz was convicted at a trial in December of, among other acts, three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, one count of interfering with law enforcement officers during a civil disorder and one of obstructing the certification of the election, which was taking place inside the Capitol on Jan. 6.",
      "In court papers filed last month, prosecutors said that he and his wife at the time made their way to \u201cthe thick of the violence\u201d at the west terrace of the Capitol, where they \u201caggressively participated in the effort to overwhelm the police line.\u201d He later boasted in a text message that he had thrown \u201cthe first chair at the cops,\u201d adding, \u201cI started a riot.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors claimed that the chair he hurled created an opening in the police line, enabling hundreds of other rioters to flood the terrace as police officers retreated. Mr. Schwartz, the prosecutors added, then stole a canister of pepper spray and other chemical munitions the police had left behind and used them \u201cto attack those same officers as they desperately tried to escape the growing and increasingly violent mob.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors noted that Mr. Schwartz was already on probation in at least one other case involving charges of assault and illegal firearms possession. Mr. Schwartz has had nearly 40 prior convictions over more than 30 years for crimes such as assault or threatening officers.",
      "More than two years after the attack, prosecutors told Judge Mehta, Mr. Schwartz showed no remorse for his actions, giving several interviews in which he claimed to be the victim of a biased prosecution. During one interview, Mr. Schwartz called the trial \u201cthe biggest sham I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d",
      "At the hearing, Mr. Schwartz\u2019s lawyer, Dennis Boyle, argued that his client had been steered to the Capitol on Jan. 6 by the lies about fraud in the 2020 election told by former President Donald J. Trump and his allies. Mr. Schwartz knew little about the presidential race and got his information from bad media sources, the lawyer said, adding that the sentence prosecutors requested \u201creeks of revenge and retribution.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere remain many grifters out there who remain free to continue propagating the \u2018great lie\u2019 that Trump won the election, Donald Trump being among the most prominent,\u201d Mr. Boyle wrote in court papers filed last month. \u201cMr. Schwartz is not one of these individuals; he knows he was wrong.\u201d",
      "Mr. Schwartz offered only a single sentence in his statement to the court, which he read off a sheet of paper from the defense table.",
      "\u201cI do sincerely regret the damage that Jan. 6 has caused to so many people and their lives,\u201d he said.",
      "But Judge Mehta seemed unconvinced, noting Mr. Schwartz had continued to appear on podcasts after his conviction, insisting that police had attacked him outside the Capitol and dismissing the charges against him as politically motivated.",
      "\u201cI appreciate you saying what you did today, but I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Judge Mehta said.",
      "About 450 of the more than 1,000 people charged so far in connection with the Capitol attack have been sentenced. Of those, the Justice Department says, slightly more than half have been ordered to serve at least some time behind bars."

    "publication_date": "2023-05-05T19:52:09.000Z",
    "body": [
      "When President Biden announced sharp restrictions in October on selling the most advanced computer chips to China, he sold it in part as a way of giving American industry a chance to restore its competitiveness.",
      "But at the Pentagon and the National Security Council, there was a second agenda: arms control.",
      "If the Chinese military cannot get the chips, the theory goes, it may slow its effort to develop weapons driven by artificial intelligence. That would give the White House, and the world, time to figure out some rules for the use of artificial intelligence in sensors, missiles and cyberweapons, and ultimately to guard against some of the nightmares conjured by Hollywood \u2014 autonomous killer robots and computers that lock out their human creators.",
      "Now, the fog of fear surrounding\u00a0the popular\u00a0ChatGPT chatbot and other generative A.I. software has made the ",
      " look like just a temporary fix. When Mr.\u00a0Biden dropped by a meeting in the White House on Thursday of technology executives who are struggling with limiting the risks of the technology, his first comment was \u201cwhat you are doing has enormous potential and enormous danger.\u201d",
      "It was a reflection, his national security aides say, of recent classified briefings about the potential for\u00a0the new technology to upend war, cyber conflict and \u2014 in the most extreme case \u2014 decision-making on employing nuclear weapons.",
      "But even as Mr. Biden was issuing his warning, Pentagon officials, speaking at technology forums, said they thought the idea of a six-month pause in developing the next generations of ChatGPT and similar software was a bad idea: The Chinese won\u2019t wait, and neither will the Russians.",
      "\u201cIf we stop, guess who\u2019s not going to stop: potential adversaries overseas,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s chief information officer, John Sherman, ",
      ". \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep moving.\u201d",
      "His blunt statement underlined the tension felt throughout the defense community today. No one really knows what these new technologies are capable of when it comes to developing and controlling weapons, and they have no idea what kind of arms control regime, if any, might work.",
      "The foreboding is vague, but deeply worrisome. Could ChatGPT empower bad actors who previously wouldn\u2019t have easy access to destructive technology? Could it speed up confrontations between superpowers, leaving little time for diplomacy\u00a0and\u00a0negotiation?",
      "\u201cThe industry isn\u2019t stupid here, and you are already seeing efforts to self-regulate,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman who served as the inaugural chairman of the advisory ",
      " from 2016 to 2020.",
      "\u201cSo there\u2019s a series of informal conversations now taking place in the industry \u2014 all informal \u2014 about what would the rules of A.I. safety look like,\u201d\u00a0said Mr. Schmidt, who\u00a0has written, with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, ",
      " about the potential of artificial intelligence to upend geopolitics.",
      "The preliminary effort to put guardrails into the system is clear to anyone who has tested ChatGPT\u2019s initial iterations. The\u00a0bots\u00a0will not answer questions about how to harm someone with a brew of drugs, for example, or how to blow up a dam or cripple nuclear centrifuges, all operations the United States and other nations have engaged in without the benefit of artificial intelligence tools.",
      "But those blacklists of actions will only slow misuse of these systems; few think they can completely stop such efforts. There is always a hack to get around safety limits, as anyone who has tried to turn off the urgent beeps on an automobile\u2019s seatbelt warning system can attest.",
      "Though the new software has popularized the issue, it is hardly a new one for the Pentagon. The first rules on developing autonomous weapons were published a decade ago. The Pentagon\u2019s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was established five years ago to explore the use of artificial intelligence in combat.",
      "Some weapons already operate on autopilot. Patriot missiles, which shoot down missiles or planes entering a protected airspace, have long had an \u201cautomatic\u201d mode. It enables them to fire without human intervention when overwhelmed with incoming targets faster than a human could react. But they are supposed to be supervised by humans who can abort attacks if necessary.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist, was conducted by Israel\u2019s Mossad using an autonomous machine gun ",
      ", though there appears to have been a high degree of remote control. Russia said recently it has begun to manufacture \u2014 but has not yet deployed \u2014 its undersea Poseidon nuclear torpedo. If it lives up to the Russian hype, the weapon would be able to travel across an ocean autonomously, evading existing missile defenses, to deliver a nuclear weapon days after it is launched.",
      "So far there are no treaties\u00a0or\u00a0international agreements that deal with such autonomous weapons. In an era when ",
      " than they are being negotiated, there is little prospect of such an accord. But the kind of challenges raised by ChatGPT and its ilk are different, and in some ways more complicated.",
      "In the military, A.I.-infused systems can speed up the tempo of battlefield decisions to such a degree that they create entirely new risks of accidental strikes, or decisions made on misleading or deliberately false alerts of incoming attacks.",
      "\u201cA core problem with A.I. in the military and in national security is how do you defend against attacks that are faster than human decision-making, and I think that issue is unresolved,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cIn other words, the missile is coming in so fast that there has to be an automatic response. What happens if it\u2019s a false signal?\u201d",
      "The Cold War was littered with stories of false warnings \u2014 once because a training tape, meant to be used for practicing nuclear response, was somehow put into the wrong system and set off an alert of a massive incoming Soviet attack. (Good judgment led to everyone standing down.) Paul Scharre, of the Center for a New American Security, noted in his 2018 book \u201cArmy of None\u201d that there were \u201cat least 13 near use nuclear incidents from 1962 to 2002,\u201d which \u201clends credence to the view that near miss incidents are normal, if terrifying, conditions of nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "For that reason, when tensions between the superpowers were a lot lower than they are today, a series of presidents tried to negotiate building more time into nuclear decision making on all sides, so that no one rushed into conflict. But generative A.I. threatens to push countries in the other direction, toward faster decision-making.",
      "The good news is that the major powers are likely to be careful \u2014 because they know what the response from an adversary would look like. But so far there are no agreed-upon rules.",
      "Anja Manuel, a former State Department official and now a principal in the consulting group Rice, Hadley, Gates and Manuel, wrote recently that even if China and Russia are not ready for arms control talks about A.I., meetings on the topic would result in discussions of what uses of A.I. are seen as\u00a0\u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Pentagon will also worry about agreeing to many limits.",
      "\u201cI fought very hard to get a policy that if you have autonomous elements of weapons, you need a way of turning them off,\u201d said Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who was a pioneer in parallel computers that were used for artificial intelligence. Mr. Hillis, who also served on the Defense Innovation Board, said that Pentagon officials pushed back, saying, \u201cIf we can turn them off, the enemy can turn them off, too.\u201d",
      "The bigger risks may come from individual actors, terrorists, ransomware groups or smaller nations with advanced cyber skills \u2014 like North Korea \u2014 that learn how to clone a smaller, less restricted version of ChatGPT. And they may find that the generative A.I. software is perfect for speeding up cyberattacks and targeting disinformation.",
      "Tom Burt, who leads trust and safety operations at Microsoft, which is ",
      " to revamp its search engines, said at a recent forum at George Washington University that he thought A.I. systems would help defenders detect anomalous behavior faster than they would help attackers. Other experts disagree. But he said he feared artificial intelligence could \u201csupercharge\u201d the spread of targeted disinformation.",
      "All of this portends a new era of arms control.",
      "Some experts say that since it would be impossible to stop the spread of ChatGPT and similar software, the best hope is to limit the specialty chips and other computing power needed to advance the technology. That will doubtless be one of many different arms control plans put forward in the next few years, at a time when the major nuclear powers, at least, seem uninterested in negotiating over old weapons, much less new ones."

    "body": [
      "The drumbeat of revelations that Justice Clarence Thomas did not disclose lavish gifts and significant financial arrangements with a billionaire Republican donor has put a spotlight on the fact that the Supreme Court has the weakest ethics rules in the federal government.",
      "But it is far less clear that anything can be done about it.",
      "Justice Thomas\u2019s behavior has underscored that financial disclosure rules for justices are porous and that the court has no binding code of ethical conduct like the one that governs lower-court judges. The court has shown no interest in adopting one, and proposals in Congress to force one upon it face steep political and constitutional hurdles.",
      "As a result, even as Supreme Court ethics have become a matter of public policy concern to a degree not seen since 1969 \u2014 when ",
      " over taking outside income from a friend and a Wall Street financier \u2014 Washington finds itself grappling with growing questions about the court\u2019s accountability and all but paralyzed over how to proceed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s like a maze you have to get out of, but each time you make a turn, you come up against a wall and you have to double back and see if you can find another route out.\u201d",
      "Congress established federal district courts and appeals courts, and in 1922, it directed the creation of the Judicial Conference, mostly composed of lower-court judges, to manage them. And in 1978, Congress ",
      " requiring financial disclosures, based on which the Judicial Conference has written detailed regulations.",
      "But while the justices ",
      " to the Senate Judiciary Committee last month that they view those rules and guidelines as important and insisted that they voluntarily follow their substance, the justices have not accepted them as constitutionally binding. Their statement noted the Judicial Conference does not supervise them.",
      "Moreover, both the judicial conference rules and the 1978 statute they are based on have ambiguities. Even after ",
      " that travel on private jets and to upscale resorts provided by friends must be disclosed, that rule does not apply to stays at luxurious private properties. And there is no maximum value on how much \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d a wealthy benefactor can lavish upon a justice or judge.",
      "Congress has also ",
      " requiring justices to recuse themselves \u201cin any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d But its standards are vague, and the court allows each justice to decide whether to recuse from a particular case and without any public explanation.",
      "In their recent statement, the justices defended that system, arguing they have a \u201cduty to sit that precludes withdrawal from a case as a matter of convenience or simply to avoid controversy\u201d since \u2014 unlike lower-court judges \u2014 there is no one to replace them.",
      "Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. appended that statement to ",
      " this week to discuss potential Supreme Court ethics reforms. When that hearing proceeded with other witnesses, its tenor made clear that there is scant prospect of significant bipartisan agreement on any legislation.",
      "Instead, from start to finish, Republican senators defended Justice Thomas\u2019s conduct and denounced a series of reports in ProPublica that have brought to light his failure to disclose myriad types of largess and financial dealings from the Republican donor, Harlan Crow.",
      "Among the disclosures Justice Thomas omitted: gifts of ",
      ", the sale of ",
      " to Mr. Crow, and the donor\u2019s ",
      " for Justice Thomas\u2019s great-nephew, over whom the justice had legal custody and was raising as a son.",
      "In deflecting criticism of Justice Thomas, the G.O.P. lawmakers cited travel provided to Democrat-appointed justices by universities, glossing over the fact that they disclosed the trips.",
      "At its core, though, Republicans\u2019 rejection of any tightening of ethics rules boiled down to casting such proposals as an attempt by liberals to delegitimize the court simply because they do not like the rulings by its supermajority of Republican-appointed justices.",
      "\u201cThis is not about trying to upgrade the ability of the court to be more transparent,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s about an effort to destroy the legitimacy of this conservative court.\u201d",
      "The partisan polarization on display at the hearing underscored that the main theoretical check against extreme misbehavior by a Supreme Court justice \u2014 impeachment by the House and removal by a vote of two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 is effectively politically impossible, especially if it could potentially alter the court\u2019s ideological composition.",
      "Part of the dilemma lies in the structure of American government, which bestows Supreme Court justices with a unique position. They wield the power to interpret laws passed by Congress as not covering a particular action or as unconstitutional. They also have life tenure, and their decisions are not subject to any higher review.",
      "This structure is meant to protect the justices\u2019 independence to best interpret the law by shielding their judgments from outside political pressures. But it has the consequence of also making it hard to impose real rules on how justices conduct themselves outside their work.",
      "For one, proposals by lawmakers to require the Supreme Court to draft its own ethics code, or to directly impose one on the justices, raise the question of whether Congress has the constitutional power to do so. Even if that were surmounted, it is not obvious how such rules would be enforced.",
      "At the Judiciary Committee hearing on the topic this week, there was broad agreement that the cleanest solution would be for the court itself to voluntarily adopt stronger ethics rules.",
      "Kedric Payne, the vice president and general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, testified that the court needed to create an internal office of staff ethics experts to provide guidance and investigate allegations of potential violations by the justices. He said they could do so immediately and it was unclear to him why they had not already.",
      "\u201cThe only way that any current ethics rules or future ethics rules will work is if there\u2019s a way to enforce these rules and a way for the Supreme Court justices to understand how they apply,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, therefore you need an internal body that can provide the ethics expert advice and also gather facts in the circumstances where there are potential violations that need to be resolved.\u201d",
      "But enforcement is the rub. A recurring theme in the hearing and the broader discussion of potential change was the lack of an obvious remedy if a justice flouted a rule or contended that it was inapplicable to something he or she wanted to do.",
      "\u201cWhat is the enforcement mechanism?\u201d Thomas Dupree, a partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, asked at the hearing. Raising a constitutional impossibility for rhetorical effect, he added: \u201cIs there going to be some superior tribunal to the Supreme Court that is going to disqualify the justices?\u201d",
      "For the same reason, it is far from clear that Chief Justice Roberts could unilaterally impose an ethics code on the rest of the court, even if he were more inclined to do so than he appears to be. If another justice chose to ignore any edict, the chief justice would have no obvious way to enforce it.",
      "The proposals that have been floated carry drawbacks. One is to have the rest of the court sit in judgment of a ninth who is accused of some transgressions, but the justices are likely to reject such a role for collegiality reasons given the guarantee of lifetime tenure and the size of the court. Another is to have a panel of appeals court judges pass judgment on a justice, but that raises structural problems since they are subordinate judges.",
      "Indeed, it is hard to envision any binding way to enforce a code of ethics on the Supreme Court. But Mr. Gillers said there would still be value in the court adopting one, predicting that justices would be inclined to comply with a standard they took an oath to obey as a matter of honor and to avoid criticism.",
      "\u201cIf the court voluntarily adopted an ethics code, academics, the media and court watchers could call out transgressions or failures to recuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very act of acknowledging \u2018I am bound by this\u2019 would give the public confidence that they will behave honorably, because violation carries a badge of shame.\u201d"

      "Federal prosecutors investigating former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents have obtained the confidential cooperation of a person who has worked for him at Mar-a-Lago, part of an intensifying effort to determine whether Mr. Trump ordered boxes containing sensitive material moved out of a storage room there as the government sought to recover it last year, multiple people familiar with the inquiry said.",
      "Through a wave of new subpoenas and grand jury testimony, the Justice Department is moving aggressively to develop a fuller picture of how the documents Mr. Trump took with him from the White House were stored, who had access to them, how the security camera system at Mar-a-Lago works and what Mr. Trump told aides and his lawyers about what material he had and where it was, the people said.",
      "At the heart of the inquiry is whether Mr. Trump sought to hide some documents after the Justice Department issued a subpoena last May demanding their return.",
      "The existence of an insider witness, whose identity has not been disclosed, could be a significant step in the investigation, which is being overseen by Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. The witness is said to have provided investigators with a picture of the storage room where the material had been held. Little else is known about what prosecutors might have learned from the witness or when the witness first began to provide information to the prosecutors.",
      "But prosecutors appear to be trying to fill in some gaps in their knowledge about the movement of the boxes, created in part by their handling of another potentially key witness, Mr. Trump\u2019s valet, Walt Nauta. Prosecutors believe Mr. Nauta has failed to provide them with a full and accurate account of his role in any movement of boxes containing the classified documents.",
      "In the past few weeks, at least four more Mar-a-Lago employees have been subpoenaed, along with another person who had visibility into Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking when he first returned material to the National Archives, according to people briefed on the matter. Two people said that nearly everyone who works at Mar-a-Lago has been subpoenaed, and that some who serve in fairly obscure jobs have been asked back by investigators.",
      "Prosecutors have also issued several subpoenas to Mr. Trump\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, seeking additional surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, his residence and private club in Florida, people with knowledge of the matter said. While the footage could shed light on the movement of the boxes, prosecutors have questioned a number of witnesses about gaps in the footage, one of the people said.",
      "But hoping to understand why some of the footage from the storage camera appears to be missing or unavailable \u2014 and whether that was a technological issue or something else \u2014 the prosecutors subpoenaed the software company that handles all of the surveillance footage for the Trump Organization, including at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "And they recently subpoenaed Matthew Calamari Sr., the longtime head of security at the Trump Organization who became its chief operating officer. His son, Matthew Calamari Jr., who is the company\u2019s corporate director of security, was subpoenaed some time ago, according to a person familiar with the activity.",
      "Both would have insight into the security camera operation, according to people familiar with the matter. Both Calamaris appeared before the grand jury gathering evidence in the case on Thursday. ",
      " that prosecutors planned to question them.",
      "One of the previously unreported subpoenas to the Trump Organization sought records pertaining to Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with a Saudi-backed professional golf venture known as LIV Golf, ",
      ".",
      "It is unclear what bearing Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with LIV Golf has on the broader investigation, but it suggests that the prosecutors are examining certain elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s family business.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Trump called the case \u201ca targeted, politically motivated witch hunt\u201d that is \u201cconcocted to meddle in an election and prevent the American people from returning him to the White House.\u201d The spokesperson accused Mr. Smith\u2019s office of harassing \u201canyone who has worked for President Trump\u201d and of now using the inquiry to target Mr. Trump\u2019s business.",
      "Investigators have been piecing together Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of government documents for months, seeking information not just about his habits after leaving the White House but also about his practices as president. Among the information they have gathered in interviews concerned his habit of flushing material down toilets, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Another related line of inquiry for Mr. Smith\u2019s team is whether Mr. Trump misled one of his lawyers, M. Evan Corcoran, about the movement of classified documents around Mar-a-Lago. In June, Mr. Corcoran helped draft a sworn statement, signed by another lawyer, saying that a \u201cdiligent search\u201d was conducted of the boxes and that any classified documents were turned over to the Justice Department.",
      "To obtain Mr. Corcoran\u2019s testimony on this subject, which would ordinarily be blocked by attorney-client privilege, the special counsel\u2019s office first had to convince a judge that Mr. Trump may have misled him. In doing so, the prosecutors invoked what is known as ",
      ", which allows them to pierce attorney-client privilege when they have reason to believe that a client used legal advice or legal services in furthering a crime.",
      "During ",
      " in March, Mr. Corcoran testified that several Trump employees had told him that the Mar-a-Lago storage room was the only place where the documents were kept, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The employees turned out to be wrong \u2014 when ",
      " they found classified documents in Mr. Trump\u2019s office and residence \u2014 but at the time, that was a common belief within Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Although Mr. Corcoran testified that Mr. Trump did not personally convey that false information, his testimony hardly absolved the former president, the people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Corcoran also recounted to the grand jury how Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers of any other locations where the documents were stored, which may have effectively misled the legal team.",
      "Prosecutors working under Mr. Smith have developed what multiple people familiar with the investigation say is a wealth of testimony and evidence about Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior during the lengthy period when the National Archives and the Justice Department sought to retrieve presidential materials from the former president.",
      "After months of requests, Mr. Trump in January 2022 turned over to the archives 15 boxes of material he had taken from the White House. Those boxes turned out to contain reams of classified material, prompting a Justice Department investigation and ",
      " demanding the return of any further documents in Mr. Trump\u2019s possession.",
      "Mr. Corcoran turned over another set of documents in response to the subpoena. But suspecting that Mr. Trump still had more based on witness testimony and video footage, prosecutors sought a search warrant, which the F.B.I. used to scour Mar-a-Lago in August, turning up more material despite the earlier statement from the lawyers saying they had found nothing else there.",
      "The Justice Department investigation has returned repeatedly in recent weeks to a crucial question: Did Mr. Trump instruct Mr. Nauta, or anyone else, to move boxes out of the storage room before the lawyers conducted the \u201cdiligent search\u201d of Mar-a-Lago and said no classified records remained at the property?",
      "Last fall, prosecutors faced a critical decision after investigators felt Mr. Nauta had misled them. To gain Mr. Nauta\u2019s cooperation, prosecutors could have used a carrot and negotiated with his lawyers, explaining that Mr. Nauta would face no legal consequences as long as he gave a thorough version of what had gone on behind closed doors at the property.",
      "Or the prosecutors could have used a stick and wielded the specter of criminal charges to push \u2014 or even frighten \u2014 Mr. Nauta into telling them what they wanted to know.",
      "The prosecutors went with the stick, telling Mr. Nauta\u2019s lawyers that he was under investigation and they were considering charging him with a crime.",
      "The move backfired, as Mr. Nauta\u2019s lawyers more or less cut off communication with the government. The decision to take an aggressive posture toward Mr. Nauta prompted internal concerns within the Justice Department. Some investigators believed that top prosecutors, including Jay Bratt, the head of the counterespionage section of the national security division at the Justice Department, had mishandled Mr. Nauta and cut off a chance to win his voluntary cooperation.",
      "More than six months later, prosecutors have still not charged Mr. Nauta or reached out to him to renew their conversation. Having gotten little from him as a witness, they are still seeking information from other witnesses about the movement of the boxes.",
      "In interviews recently, the Justice Department has been focused on Mr. Nauta and the help he received from a Mar-a-Lago maintenance worker ",
      ". They have asked multiple people questions about it, as well as questions about the security cameras and what they did and did not capture. They have asked questions specifically about whether Mr. Nauta was walking to or from the president\u2019s residence on the property, according to a person briefed on the matter.",
      "In addition to seeking testimony from the Calamaris and other Trump Organization employees, the special counsel\u2019s office has issued numerous subpoenas to the company itself, seeking a variety of internal documents, according to people with knowledge of the subpoenas.",
      "Another line of inquiry that prosecutors have been pursuing relates to how Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have helped hire and pay for lawyers representing some of the witnesses in investigations related to the former president. They have been trying to assess whether the witnesses were sized up for how much loyalty they might have to Mr. Trump as a condition of providing assistance, according to people briefed on the matter.",
