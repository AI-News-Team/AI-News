            "Expect Democrats to once again employ a similar line of attack.",
            "Mr Trump's current legal drama may reach a crescendo and conclude well before a vote is cast in 2024. The political fallout could ultimately depend on the course it tracks - and whether this case is joined by others.",
            "For the moment, however, the partisan lines on Mr Trump's indictment are clearly drawn - as they have been on almost every major issue of national importance in America today. While Thursday night was a thunder clap, the political trench warfare seems bound to continue unabated."

            "Pistorius was initially found guilty of culpable homicide, but on appeal he was convicted of murder, on the grounds that he must have known his actions - shooting three times through a locked bathroom door in his Pretoria home - would lead to the death of whoever was on the other side.",
            "\"I think he's probably got an arguable case [for parole],\" said Mannie Witz, a defence attorney, who also noted that the Steenkamps could challenge a decision to grant Pistorius parole in court, potentially delaying his release for many months.",

            "Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow's nuclear sabre-rattling has been loud and frequent. ",
            "Senior officials have dropped unsubtle hints that Western nations arming Ukraine should not push Russia too far. A few days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. ",

            "\"They announce: 'We've got this missile, that missile, another kind of missile.' They talk about targeting Britain and France; about sparking a nuclear tsunami that washes away America. Why do they say this? So that people here are ready.\"",
            "On Russian state TV recently, a prominent talk-show host suggested that Russia \"should declare any military target on the territory of France, Poland and the United Kingdom a legitimate target for [Russia]\".",

            "Yet state propaganda here portrays Russia as a country of peace, and Ukraine and the West as the aggressors. Many Russians believe it.",
            "\"People in Russia have been irradiated by propaganda,\" Mr Muratov says. \"Propaganda is a type of radiation. Everyone is susceptible to it, not just Russians. In Russia, propaganda is twelve TV channels, tens of thousands of newspapers, social media like VK [the Russian version of Facebook] that serves completely the state ideology.\"",
            "\"But what if tomorrow the propaganda suddenly stops?\" I ask. \"If it all goes quiet? What would Russians think then?\"",
            "\"Our younger generation is wonderful,\" replies Mr Muratov. \"It's well-educated. Nearly a million Russians have left the country. Many of those who've stayed are categorically against what is happening in Ukraine. They are against the hell that Russia has created there.",

Media outlets have been shut down. Many activists, civilians and journalists have been labelled foreign agents.",

But these are elderly people who see Putin as their own grandson, as someone who will protect them and who brings them their pension every month and wishes them Happy New Year each year. These people believe their actual grandchildren should go and fight and die.\"",

            "\"I want to build a Pong-like game,\" he typed, referencing Atari's table tennis game of the 1970s. \"What's the best language to [use] so that lots of people can try?\"",
            "ChatGPT not only recommended a programming language that runs in the browser (JavaScript), but also generated the code for a simple version of the game.",
            "What would have taken an experienced developer half an hour to write took ChatGPT 40 seconds. It worked equally well for classic arcade games Breakout and Asteroids. ",
            "There are lots of code examples for these games online, but ChatGPT isn't searching the internet for a ready-made answer.",
            "Although it's been built using huge amounts of web content, ChatGPT generates new text just for you by predicting the right answer. ",
            "\"ChatGPT was able to understand my question about how I make this game more popular,\" says Mr Schirano. \"It has a lot of contextual understanding that somebody who's never developed couldn't get from Google.\" ",
            "Using a search engine, you'd have to figure out which coding language to use, how to use it, and how to finish any incomplete examples online. ChatGPT can give you all the game code, together with instructions tailored to your needs.",
            "\"Now, even somebody who has no idea of what they're doing can create a simple web app,\" says Mr Schirano.",
            "Some say that recreating these old games was too easy because there are so many examples online. ",
            "So Mr Schirano's colleague Ammaar Reshi, design manager at Brex, pushed ChatGPT further. He asked it to recreate an old PC game for which there is no example code online. It's a 3D game called Skyroads where you guide a car along a road, jumping over barriers.",
            "ChatGPT knew about the game from its Wikipedia page and Mr Reshi elaborated on how the game works. \"There was so much back and forth with this one,\" says Mr Reshi. \"Literally an hour of tweak this, tweak that.\" He had to test the game, tell ChatGPT how to change the game behaviour, and repeat.",
            "Even so, Mr Reshi was able to build an online 3D game, despite not knowing any of the JavaScript language used to build it, and without ChatGPT having access to code examples for that game.",
            "These are small games, and nobody's suggesting ChatGPT will be making modern console games. But it could be used to make parts of a major game, or to help create any other software. ",
            "But even with the productivity improvements, some hesitate to adopt AI for coding.",
            "\"The risks of ChatGPT for software development still outweigh the benefits,\" says Tony Smith, chief technology officer at Rightly, an organisation that helps people get their data deleted from company databases. \"The code these AIs generate is often flawed or inefficient.\"",
            "Mr Smith asked ChatGPT to create some code to work out how many days are in a given month. \"The code looks great, however there's a problem with the shift to British Summer Time, so it thinks March has 30 days,\" he says. \"There's a subtle bug that will show up once a year.\"",
            "Others have found that AI-generated code can include security flaws. ChatGPT may model bad behaviour it's seen online, overlook vulnerabilities or use outdated techniques. Also, ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events after 2021.",
            "Business risk increases, too, if people are tempted to use code they don't understand.  ",
            "Kevin Bocek is vice president, security strategy and threat intelligence, at Venafi, a company that makes security software for authenticating machines. He used ChatGPT to create Excel macros and PowerShell scripts, which are two different ways to give a computer repeatable instructions. Hackers often use them to launch an attack.",
            "\"Now I've got code that's come from 'out there' and I'm going to run it, and I've got no idea what it does,\" he says. \"The opportunity has now increased for more code to come in that might be harmful.\" ",
            "While AI can be used to create code, it will always be the developer's responsibility to check it at Venafi. \"That's something we take very seriously,\" he says. \"Code is reviewed multiple times by humans. Ultimately, it's the professional developers that are responsible and accountable.\"",
            "Herd, a performance marketing and web agency, makes slideshow-style elements on some of its websites. \"Writing the JavaScript code individually for each section can be painful, so ChatGPT really speeds that process up,\" says Matthew Hunt, a junior web developer at Herd. ",
            "He's concerned, though, that ChatGPT could take away some of the satisfying work, too. \"Part of the joy of developing is learning exactly what a file does and how it all works,\" he says. \"If ChatGPT is doing this for us, we aren't really growing as developers.\"",
            "Dan Ciruli, vice president of technology at cloud management company D2iQ, has a different take. He previously worked at Google.",
            "Google's application programming interfaces (APIs) enable developers to connect their software to Google services. There were 200 APIs and seven supported programming languages, including Python. To provide instructions for every API in each language, Google would have to create 1,400 code examples.",
            "\"That's something we struggled with,\" he says. \"We just couldn't create samples in every [programming] language. But when I got access to ChatGPT, the first thing I did was ask it to show me how to call the Google Translate API in Python. Boom - there it was.\"",
            "The future of software development is likely to be a partnership between the developer and the AI assistant, which is reflected in the name of one popular AI tool. GitHub Copilot is a commercial tool that automatically completes code as developers work. The code completion uses a faster but less accurate model than ChatGPT.",
            "\"Given you're typing code, ideally every time you input a character, you get a new response,\" says GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke. ",
            "Although Copilot has been upgraded with features to detect and block insecure code, humans remain an essential safeguard. \"Like any other coding tool, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with human code review, testing practices and security tools,\" says Mr Dohmke.",
            "Will AI code generation lead to job losses? Mr Schirano and Mr Reshi can both foresee that junior roles could be replaced if AI takes on repetitive coding work.",
            "Manuel Doc is a front-end developer at user experience agency Illustrate Digital. \"I was so amazed by ChatGPT's code-level responses that I was scared my job would be in jeopardy soon,\" he says. ",
            "\"However, during my 1-2-1 with our head developer, he helped me understand that I'm not just hired to write code, but to analyse problems and provide solutions that ChatGPT can't give. It was very reassuring.\""

            "According to Mr Acharya, who is now a professor of economics at NYU Stern, \"industrial concentration\" - which refers to the extent to which a smaller number of firms account for total production in a country - fell sharply in India after 1991 when the country opened up its economy and state-owned monopolies began giving away their market share to private enterprises. But after 2015, it began rising again. ",
            "The share of India's \"big five\" conglomerates - the Reliance Group, Adani Group, Tata Group, Aditya Birla Group and Bharti Airtel - in total assets of non-financial sectors rose from 10% in 1991 to nearly 18% in 2021.  ",
            "They \"grew not just at the expense of the smallest firms, but also of the next largest firms\", says Mr Acharya, because the share in total assets of the next five business groups halved from 18% to 9% during this period. ",
            "There could have been many drivers of this, according to Mr Acharya -  their ability to acquire large distressed companies, a growing appetite for mergers and acquisitions, and India's conscious industrial policy of creating \"national champions via preferential allocation of projects and in some cases regulatory agencies turning a blind eye to predatory pricing\". ",
            "The trend raises several concerns, according to the former deputy governor. These include \"the risk of crony capitalism, i.e., political connections and inefficient project allocations, related party transactions within their byzantine corporate organisation charts\", taking on excess debt to fund their expansion and preventing competitors from entering the market. ",
            "Excess leverage was, in fact, one of the many red flags that US-based short seller Hindenburg Research had also raised against the Adani Group recently. The report led to ",
            " the stock market. ",
            "In other countries this has had far graver spillover effects in the past. ",
            "\"National champions can easily become overleveraged and collapse, severely damaging the overall economy, as has occurred in other Asian countries, most spectacularly Indonesia in 1998,\" Josh Felman, former India head of the International Monetary Fund, told the BBC. ",
            "In a February column for ",
            ", the economist Nouriel Roubini had also expressed concerns about India's economic model of giving a few \"national champions\" or \"large private oligopolistic conglomerates\" control over significant parts of the economy. ",
            "\"These conglomerates have been able to capture policymaking to benefit themselves,\" wrote Mr Roubini. The phenomenon was stifling innovation and disallowing entry of start-ups and other domestic entrants in key industries, he said.",
            "India's policy of creating \"national champions\" is similar to those adopted by China, Indonesia and particularly South Korea in the 1990s, where a group of mostly family-run business conglomerates - called chaebols, of which smartphone giant Samsung is the most prominent example - dominated its economy.  ",
            "But unlike India, these countries \"did not protect their conglomerates with sky-high tariffs\", says Mr Acharya. India, however, has been becoming more protectionist in order to \"insulate domestic industries and conglomerates from global competition\", Mr Roubini wrote.   ",
            "All of this has major implications on India's attempts to become ",
            ".",
            "According to both Mr Acharya and Mr Roubini, India needs to reduce tariffs to become more globally competitive and take advantage of the \"China plus one\" trend where supply chains are moving away from mainland China into geographies like India and Vietnam. ",
            "India's industrial concentration could also have domestic consequences, Mr Acharya argues - the rising market power of the \"big five\" may be one of the contributors to persistently high core inflation, or the rise in the price of goods and services barring food and energy.",
            "\"While a deeper and fuller inquiry is warranted, we find that there is a potentially causal link from market power to markups,\" writes Mr Acharya, adding that these companies are able to \"exert extraordinary pricing power and capture economic rents relative to other firms in the industry\". ",
            "But other economists told the BBC that they are sceptical of this correlation.",
            "\"If a 'big five' firm enters a new sector, the group may become bigger, but competition in that specific sector may increase and prices might actually fall. A most spectacular example of this dynamic occurred when Reliance decided to start [telecom company] Jio: telecoms prices crashed,\" says Mr Felman.",
            "Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, says there isn't \"enough evidence\" to support this thesis.",
            "According to him, even in markets dominated by a small number of firms, such as airlines - where most of these conglomerates do not have a presence - prices have consistently been high.",
            "He adds that the sectors that feed into core inflation at the consumer level -  recreation, education, health, household goods, consumer care - don't have the presence of the big five either. "

            "In the mid-1970s, with the world's economy reeling from the 1973 oil price shock, President Ferdinand Marcos Sr decided to bring nuclear power to the Philippines. ",
            "It would have put the country alongside Japan and South Korea as a pioneer of nuclear energy in Asia. Marcos Sr commissioned the US company Westinghouse to build two pressurised water reactors on the Bataan peninsula, on the far side of Manila Bay. ",
            "By the end of 1985 the first reactor was complete and ready to be loaded with nuclear fuel.",
            "But in February the following year Marcos Sr was forced from power as two million protesters took to the streets of Manila, demanding an end to his dictatorship. ",
            "Just eight weeks later reports began to emerge of a terrible accident at a nuclear power plant in the then Soviet Union. A new word entered the global vernacular: Chernobyl. ",
            "Plans to load fuel into the Bataan plant were put on hold indefinitely. ",
            "Inside the plant, the main control room looks shockingly old and outdated, almost like a museum. ",
            "The wall panels are filled with dozens of ancient-looking analogue dials. Below them, the control panels are a forest of black mechanical switches. ",
            "Mr Cojuangco waves away these objections: \"People always use the analogy of cars or motorcycles. But the mode of ageing of a nuclear reactor is from neutron bombardment. So far, this reactor has had none, so effectively it's brand new.\"  ",
            "He doesn't deny that the systems in the plant will need plenty of work, and that it will cost time and money. He says South Korean nuclear operator KEPCO, which runs an identical nuclear plant in Busan, has offered to bring the one in Bataan up to date for around $1.5bn (\u00a3915m). ",
            "The plant's lone reactor - a planned second one was never built - can produce up to 620 megawatts of power, about half the capacity of its more modern counterparts. ",
            "Mr Cojuangco repeatedly points out that Bataan would not be the first old, mothballed nuclear plant to be put into operation. ",
            "It's been done before - in Tennessee. Work on Watts Bar Two, as the plant is known, began in 1973, even before Bataan. But then it was mothballed for decades, says Mr Cojuangco, before they decided to finish construction in 2009. ",
            "\"In 2016, it became America's newest nuclear plant. If it's ok there, then why not here?\" he asks. ",
            "For President Marcos Jr this might well be the best opportunity to revive his father's dream. The war in Ukraine has set off another energy price shock across the globe, and the Philippines is being hit hard.  ",
            "At the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, Dr Carlos Arcilla points to a pie chart that breaks down the country's energy sources. ",
            "\"You can see 50%  is from coal, and 90% of that coal is imported from Indonesia,\" he says. ",
            "The Philippines has one small natural gas field of its own, but that is running out. Electricity prices have doubled in the last 12 months as the country becomes more dependent than ever on imported fossil fuel. ",
            "\"The average Filipino already pays 10% of take-home pay on electricity,\" Dr Arcilla says, adding that prices will go higher. ",
            "The impact is greatest among the poorest. You don't have to walk far in Metro Manila to find poor neighbourhoods, or barangay as they are known. All over the city vacant land is taken over and turned into squatter settlements, where homes are made from scrap wood and corrugated iron. ",
            "In one barangay not far from Dr Arcilla's office lives Marilou Calica, a 47-year-old mother of six,  who works as a part-time cleaner in a government office. The fatigue is written on her face. ",
            "\"I haven't paid my electricity bill for the last three months,\" she says. \"After I have bought food there is nothing left.\"  ",
            "She pulls out a sheet of printed paper - a final notice from the electricity company. Her outstanding bill: 5,000 pesos (about $100; $75). She says it's double what she paid a year ago. ",
            "\"If I don't pay this week, they will cut me off. I may be forced to go to the money lender.\" ",
            "Despite the struggles of poor Filipinos, the move to reopen the Bataan plant - and eventually lower the country's energy bill - faces stiff opposition. ",
            "Anti-nuclear groups say re-commissioning the plant will take years and do nothing to help people like Ms Calica. Instead, they say the government should be investing in local solar and wind projects that are cheaper and much quicker to build. ",
            "\"If they get it running, by 2040 it will contribute only 2.5% of the power in the Philippines, so why do they really want to do it?\" says Derek Cabe, who leads the Nuclear Free Bataan Movement. ",
            "She says her parents' generation fought to stop the plant in the 1980s and she is ready to do the same now.",
            "\"We cannot let the monster live again,\" she says. \"We call it the sleeping monster and we cannot let the monster be awakened.\"",
            "Those who oppose the plant draw comparisons between the Philippines and Japan, and between the Bataan plant and the one in Fukushima, which was destroyed in the 2011 tsunami. ",
            "Both countries sit on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire. The Philippines has two dozen active volcanoes, and is regularly hit by earthquakes and is also vulnerable to tsunamis. ",
            "But Mr Cojuangco, who has been to Fukushima and studied the disaster there, is not worried. ",
            "\"Before the incident in Fukushima I had no basis for saying that if we had a 9.0 earthquake here, we would sail through it. But now I have the evidence. The plant here is 18 metres above sea level. With a same-sized tsunami as Fukushima the plant would not even get wet. If this plant had been at Fukushima, there would be no incident to talk about.\"",
            "Around 60% of Filipinos now say they support the country building nuclear power. And there appears to be no scientific reason to stop this relic from the 1970s from producing electricity one day.  ",
            "Its biggest obstacle is politics. In the Philippines, a president can only serve a single six-year term. And for Mr Cojuangco the moment is now because after 37 years, history has come full circle.",
            "\"In the 1980s we wanted to be independent of fossil fuels,\" he says, \"Now in 2023 we have an energy crisis again, and there is another Marcos president in the Malaca\u00f1ang palace.\" "

            "The exact charges have not yet been disclosed, but here are some key questions on the issues at play in this case.",
            "In 2016, adult film star Stormy Daniels contacted media outlets offering to sell her account of what she said was an adulterous affair she had with Donald Trump in 2006. ",
            "Mr Trump's team got wind of this, and his lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to Ms Daniels to keep quiet.",
            "This is not illegal. However, when Mr Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the record for the payment says it was for legal fees. Prosecutors say this amounts to Mr Trump falsifying business records, which is a misdemeanour - a criminal offence - in New York.",
            "Prosecutors could also potentially allege that this breaks election law, because his attempt to hide his payments to Ms Daniels was motivated by not wanting voters to know he had an affair with her. Covering up a crime by falsifying records would be a felony, which is a more serious charge.",
            "Even advocates for prosecution acknowledge that either way, this is by no means a clear-cut case. There is little precedent for such a prosecution, and past attempts to charge politicians with crossing the line between campaign finance and personal spending have ended in failure.",
            "\"It's going to be tough,\" says Catherine Christian, a former financial prosecutor for the New York City district attorney. ",
            "The decision on whether to file charges rests with New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He set up the grand jury to investigate whether there was enough evidence to pursue a prosecution, and he was the only one who knew when an indictment would be voted on.",
            "On Thursday afternoon, that grand jury reportedly decided to bring charges. But at the moment, we do not know what those charges are. ",
            "Mr Bragg will inform Mr Trump and his lawyers, setting off negotiations over how and when the former president will appear in New York City for his formal arrest and first hearing in court. ",
            "The document presenting the official charges against Mr Trump will not be made public until a judge reads out the charges against him.",
            "Given the historic nature of such a move, and the security concerns involved, the details of Mr Trump's New York appearance are somewhat uncertain.",
            "Mr Trump's lawyers have indicated that he will co-operate with New York authorities, so there would be no warrant put out for his arrest. ",
            "Mr Trump has his own personal jet, so he could fly into one of several New York area airports and then make the journey to the lower Manhattan courthouse by car.",
            "As part of those negotiations with prosecutors, the court may also agree to grant him a private entrance to the court, instead of the more typical \"perp walk\" in front of the assembled media. ",
            "Once inside, however, Mr Trump will be fingerprinted and have his mug shot taken like all defendants in criminal cases. He will also be read his \"Miranda\" rights, reminding him of his constitutionally-protected right to a lawyer and to decline to talk to police.",
            "Defendants charged with a felony are typically handcuffed temporarily, although Mr Trump's lawyers will try to avoid that for their client. Throughout the booking process, he will be accompanied by Secret Service agents.",
            "Mr Trump would then wait in a holding area or cell until his appearance before a judge. The arraignment - the moment where a defendant enters their plea before a judge - is open to the public. ",
            "Once the case is booked and a judge is selected, other details will fall into place, such as the timing of the trial and possible travel restrictions and bail requirements for the defendant. ",
            "A conviction on a misdemeanour would result in a fine. If Mr Trump were convicted on the felony charge, he would face a maximum sentence of four years in prison, although some legal experts predict a fine is more probable, and that any time behind bars is highly unlikely. ",
            "An indictment or even a criminal conviction would not prevent Mr Trump from continuing his presidential campaign if he so chooses - and he has given every indication that he will keep pushing ahead regardless of what happens.",
            "In fact, there is nothing in US law that prevents a candidate who is found guilty of a crime from campaigning for, and serving as, president - even from prison.",
            "Mr Trump's arrest would certainly complicate his presidential campaign, however. ",
            "While it might cause some Republican voters to rally around their embattled champion, it could be a significant distraction for a candidate on the campaign trail, trying to stump for votes and participate in debates.",
            "It would also deepen and enflame already sharp divides within the American political system. ",
            "Conservatives believe the former president is being held to a different standard of justice, while liberals view this as an issue of holding law-breakers - even those in the highest positions of power - accountable."

            "Russia's foreign ministry earlier condemned Finland's decision, saying it was ill-considered and based on Russophobic hysteria. ",

Five days later, Khadeer was freed because the police were unsure whether they had the right man. But later, he died in hospital after recording a video in which he blamed his condition on torture in custody, a claim the police denied. ",
            "Khadeer was possibly detained because of dodgy footage. \"The CCTV footage was not very clear because it was evening and it was dark,\" a police officer told ",
            ".",
            "There are more than 1.5 million security cameras across 15 cities in India, according to Comparitech, a UK-based cyber security and privacy research firm. A combined population of 135.8 million in these cities works out to an average of 11 cameras per 1,000 people. Citizens believe they help reduce crime - though some studies show they are more useful in solving crimes than preventing them - but civil liberties groups warn of the perils of mass surveillance.",
            "Some Indian cities are bristling with more cameras than others. Hyderabad has nearly 42 cameras per 1,000 people. Indore had the highest - 63 per 1,000 people. These two cities, along with the capital Delhi (26.7 cameras) and Chennai (24.53 cameras), were among the top most surveilled cities in the world, according to Comparitech.",
            "Demand for CCTV cameras is also rising. Last July, just one firm - Godrej Security Solutions - reported a 40% rise in sales over 2022. Driving through the countryside in the northern state of Bihar recently, I found cameras placed on heaps of bricks in soot-laden kilns that were spewing smoke and powering the country's construction boom. They were keeping an eye on poor farmers who were making bricks. Thanks to plummeting prices, even a few homes had cameras outside the main door. \"It's a status symbol now,\" a villager told me.",
            "A new report by Common Cause, a non-profit group, in collaboration with Lokniti-CSDS, a polling group, appears to reaffirm this enthusiasm for surveillance among Indians. The study - based on interviews with more than 9,700 people in 12 states - finds a \"high level of public support for certain forms of government surveillance\". ",
            "It found that one in two respondents had installed CCTVs in their households and neighbourhoods. Affluent people were more than three times more likely to have CCTV coverage in their neighbourhoods, compared with slums and poor neighbourhoods. More educated people believed that CCTV worked for crime reduction and public safety and less as a tool for mass surveillance. ",
            "Three out of four respondents strongly believed that CCTVs helped monitor and reduce crime - except that the jury is out on this much-vaunted claim. Research by Comparitech found little - if any - correlation between the number of cameras and crime rates. ",
            "In Indore, where the cameras per 1,000 people was the highest, the crime index - the estimated overall level of crime in the city - was slightly higher than in Kozhikode in Kerala which had a mere 0.05 cameras per 100,000 people. \"This trend is something we witnessed across the board in our study, demonstrating that more CCTV cameras don't necessarily mean lower crime rates,\" says Rebecca Moody of Comparitech.",
            "Governments were also three times more likely to install CCTV cameras in slums and poor areas compared with high-income neighbourhoods, the report found. The poor were least likely to support the installation of CCTVs at any location - entry of homes, inside the house or at places of work. ",
            "\"There is a difference between the middle class and the rich public's perception, who are more likely to support surveillance. The poor, on the other hand, are more likely to view it critically, perhaps because they are more often at the receiving end of the state's ire,\" the report said.",
            "What accounts for India's love for CCTVs, a shorthand for what appears to be a wholehearted embrace of surveillance and surrender of the right to privacy? Cameras may make people safer, but the lack of regulation around their use and storage of data does pose a \"serious threat to citizens' privacy, especially when things like facial recognition are used in conjunction with these systems\", says Ms Moody.",
            "The report also found that two out of the three people had not heard of the 2021 Pegasus spyware issue in which activists, journalists, politicians and lawyers around the world - including 30 reportedly from India - were allegedly targeted with phone spyware sold to governments by an Israeli firm. ",

            "It's a scare that has gripped northern Thailand where millions of people are currently finding it harder to breathe. ",
            "Widespread farm burning and forest fires have created a smog that's even thicker than usual, which is choking communities and exposing them to respiratory disease.",
            "In the tourist-favoured Chiang Rai province, and even the capital Bangkok, people have been on edge checking the air quality levels every day.",
            "\"I feel very sorry for my daughter,\" said Thommamoon, who has not seen haze this thick in the 20 years he has lived in Chiang Rai. ",
            "\"As a child she doesn't know. She thinks that it's natural fog. But the truth is a poisonous mist.\"",
            "The girl is under strict orders to stay at home, but even indoors and with an air purifier whirring away, the air quality is compromised.",
            "At Chiang Rai's Mae Chan Hospital, Dr. Veera Isarathanan fears for newborns who are exposed to the air pollution. Babies can't wear face masks, and even with a purifier machine, the air in the nursery can be hazardous.",
            "\"[It's sad] newborn children have to encounter pollution like this. Their lungs are just starting to work,\" Dr Isarathanan said.",
            "Thailand's air pollution is an issue year each year in the dry season - which typically runs from November to March - mainly due to seasonal burning from farmers clearing their sugarcane and rice fields.",
            "But the smog has been particularly bad this year. ",
            "On 10 March, Thai health authorities reported that in the first nine weeks of the year, more than 1.3 million people had already suffered air pollution-related diseases. ",
            "Nearly 200,000 of these cases were reported in the first week of March - when the haze had started to worsen.",
            "In Chiang Rai, the haze has grown so thick to obscure its famous mountains, and what is usually lush, green foliage appears grey.",
            "Drone footage passing over the city's parks and streets show them near unrecognisable, with buildings reduced to smoky outlines. ",
            "The levels of the hazardous PM 2.5 particles have also soared - these are particles are small enough to be be breathed into lungs and even enter bloodstreams.",
            "Exposure to PM 2.5 dust can cause burning and itching in the eyes and skin,  as well as coughing and chest tightness. These symptoms can be amplified for those who have pre-existing heart or lung conditions.",
            "In Chiang Rai, fire trucks were this week deployed to blast water into the air to clear the dust. But it's only a short-term measure. ",
            "Authorities have warned that the grim scenario will persist for the coming days, with few winds forecast that could blow the dust away.",
            "On Monday, about 200 people in the Chiang Rai district of Mae Sai protested outside a local government office demanding authorities take action.",
            "\"Nowadays, Mae Sai people live in misery. Both young and old, living in hardship,\" said one of the demonstrators, Somyot Nittayaroj.",
            "Somyot said the haze had gotten worse in the last two to three years. ",
            "That day, the air quality levels in parts of Chiang Rai and farther north in Chiang Mai, were nearly 125 times over the limit deemed safe by the World Health Organization.",
            "Protesters said Thailand should negotiate with Myanmar and other neighbouring countries where agricultural burning has contributed to the smog.",
            "Satellite data showed that many of fire hot spots were located in Myanmar, followed by Laos. Fires were also spotted in Cambodia and Vietnam.",
            "However a majority of the pollution still comes from closer sources. ",
            "Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has directed lawmakers to go after perpetrators of forest fires and there are laws in place curtailing agricultural burning. ",
            "But the problem is most of these restrictions are ignored. For farmers, burning their plot is often the easiest and cheapest method to clear land."
