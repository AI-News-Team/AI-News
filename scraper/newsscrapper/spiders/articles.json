      "CHESTER, England \u2014 When Waheed Arian was 5, his father knelt by his side and handed him a big, colorful kite. That small moment, in Afghanistan, seared itself into the son\u2019s memory.",
      "\u201cI was a child born into war, \u201c said Dr. Arian, now 39 and a medical doctor. \u201cI had no idea what normality was like. And I only have a couple of happy memories like this from the first years of my life.\u201d",
      "Those years, in the late 1980s and 1990s, were spent in the chaos of war, with uncertainty swirling around him, first in his home city of Kabul; then in a refugee camp in Pakistan where he was displaced with his family; and then back to an Afghanistan engulfed in civil war.",
      "Decades later, driven by hopes of one day becoming a doctor, he established a new life in Britain, where he overcame post-traumatic stress disorder, learned English and studied medicine at Cambridge University, eventually becoming an emergency room doctor.",
      "\u201cI came in with no family support and hardly an education,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cBut I wanted to do something with my life and I was taking steps toward it, although it was a long shot.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, ",
      " from Kabul to Britain as an asylum seeker. His story, a personal tale of overcoming odds, illustrates how Britain\u2019s asylum system has long provided sanctuary and opportunity for countless people.",
      "But in recent years, successive Conservative governments have cracked down on the process, particularly with policies intended to deter asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel.",
      "This month, the government ",
      " crossing the Channel without hearing their asylum claims, a position that has been criticized by human rights groups. The British government says that many who arrive this way are economic migrants and that the policy will act as a deterrent. Government data, though, shows that a majority who reach shore are eventually granted asylum.",
      "Dr. Arian said his own journey showed \u201cwhat can be done when you allow people to realize their potential.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this case, you can see the future I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are so many other futures on the line.\u201d",
      "Speaking from his home in Chester in northwestern England, Dr. Arian, a father of two, recounted the arduous journey that led him out of Afghanistan.",
      "When his parents sent him to Britain in 1999, alone at 15, it was a tough decision for them, he said. But, he explained, \u201cI was at risk of being taken as a military soldier.\u201d He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a future. I wanted to become a doctor, not a killer.\u201d",
      "So his parents scraped together the money to pay a man to help him get to Britain to join a family friend.",
      "He boarded a plane from Islamabad, Pakistan, a false passport in hand, and claimed asylum when he arrived.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I landed in the U.K., I was handcuffed and I was put in a prison,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did come with that hope of safety, and the dream to become a doctor.\u201d",
      "That dream began in childhood when he was treated for tuberculosis contracted in the refugee camp in Pakistan. Despite a grim prognosis, a local doctor gave him excellent care \u2014 and a textbook and a stethoscope. He made a full recovery and he now knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, I saw so much suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on the other hand, there was this healer who could actually magically heal people.\u201d",
      "He eventually received refugee status in Britain. He worked three jobs and began studying for his college exams. He remembers other Afghan refugees telling him to become a driver or maybe a shopkeeper.",
      "Instead, he applied to Cambridge University. And against the odds, he got in, and then went on to medical school. He became a British citizen.",
      "A soft-spoken man who seems to put care and attention into every word, Dr. Arian spoke of the importance of giving back through humanitarian efforts.",
      "\u201cWe might think it\u2019s a small thing,\u201d he said, describing the many supporters who offered him a kind word, a job or other opportunities over the years. \u201cBut it\u2019s not for many refugees. Their futures rely on all these small parts, these bits of community service, that can then shape their future.\u201d",
      "In 2015, he founded, ",
      ", a nonprofit online platform\u00a0that connects British doctors with medics in Afghanistan through video links. The service was later extended to connect doctors in Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones, to professionals around the world. It ",
      "Dr. Arian is now building off that success with\u00a0",
      ", a platform meant to offer culturally sensitive mental health support, which he believes can be beneficial for refugees who have experienced trauma. It will be free for those who can\u2019t afford to pay.",
      "He hopes to roll out Arian Wellbeing in the coming months to provide aid for those newly arrived in Britain as part of a pilot with some local officials. Within five years, he hopes thousands of psychologists will offer their services on the platform, so that it can help when the next disaster, like the recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria, or the war in Ukraine, arrives.",
      "For years after reaching the safety of Britain, the ghosts of his past haunted him.",
      "\u201cI was working so hard, three jobs at first \u2014 cleaning, kitchen porter, as well as a salesman, and in the evening I was studying a bit of English as well,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cIt was at that time that my PTSD started showing.\u201d",
      "He found himself unable to relax, clenching his hands and having flashbacks. In the middle of the night, he would wake up with intense nightmares.",
      "Working with a psychologist has helped him address these problems, he said.",
      "He, his wife and their children live in a two-bedroom home with a big backyard. They have a Burmese cat and a small dog named Pushkin. The yard is scattered with children\u2019s toys, and the walls of the home are lined with family photos. Some siblings and his father are still in Afghanistan; his mother recently died there.",
      "Last month, Dr. Arian visited a local hotel where hundreds of recently arrived asylum seekers from Afghanistan were being housed after being displaced when the country was retaken by the Taliban in 2021.",
      "\u201cI see the same problems that I experienced in their eyes,\u201d he said, describing how the children\u2019s faces lit up when he spoke to them in their shared mother tongue.",
      "In this meeting, and in the others he has had with asylum seekers from across the world who arrive in Britain, he said he has seen just how detrimental the government\u2019s policies have been on their mental health.",
      "\u201cI can only imagine what at-risk refugees are going through in hotels,\u201d he said, where many are being housed as they await a decision on their future. \u201cWe have made friends with some of them, and they are being retraumatized to be going through all this.\u201d",
      "Most of all, he saw a reflection of his own story. He hopes he can be an example for those who struggle with the complexity of life in a new and unfamiliar place.",
      "\u201cWhenever I speak to these refugees, they have their individual dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I understand that.\u201d"

      "SANTA MAR\u00cdA DE JES\u00daS, Guatemala \u2014 For her big underwater scene in \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever,\u201d the Guatemalan actress Mar\u00eda Mercedes Coroy had to hold her breath as her character, Princess Fen, gives birth in a hazy ocean world to a winged serpent son.",
      "She emerges from the watery depths as a rarity even in Marvel\u2019s fantastical universe: a female Maya superhero.",
      "The day after filming her final scene in Los Angeles, Ms. Coroy, rather than hanging out in Hollywood, headed home to Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, a Kaqchikel Maya town of about 22,000 at the base of a volcano in Guatemala. By nightfall, she was curled up in bed in her family\u2019s bright pink cinder block house with vegetables growing in the backyard.",
      "\u201cI felt like my bed was hugging me,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, 28, one of nine siblings in a family of farmers and vendors.",
      "The next morning she resumed her usual life. She and her mother put on their hand-woven huipiles, or blouses, and cortes, or skirts, to catch the 5:30 bus to the small city of Escuintla to sell produce in the bustling market, a job she started after fifth grade when she had to drop out of school to help her parents.",
      "Some days she walks two hours with a mule to the family farm to cultivate cabbage and pumpkins. In her spare time, she weaves colorful huipiles with motifs of birds and flowers on a backstrap loom.",
      "\u201cPeople ask me what I do after filming,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who is working on her third Guatemalan movie after appearing in two in the United States. \u201cI go back to normal.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy represents a new generation of Maya actors determined to hone their craft while holding onto their customs and helping expose a legacy of discrimination against Guatemala\u2019s Indigenous population.",
      "While she said she enjoys acting in the United States \u2014 and posing in a pink and blue huipil at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards \u2014 she is more interested in her own country\u2019s burgeoning film industry.",
      "But whether she\u2019s working in her homeland or Hollywood, acting can be draining, and she relies on Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas to recharge her.",
      "\u201cI love my life, but filming is physically demanding,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, relaxing on a bench in Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019s central park. \u201cThis is my community.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy\u2019s first role was the lead in a school play production of \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u201d",
      "Santa Mar\u00eda de Jesus has long been locally famous for its street theater, and a decade ago, the Guatemalan director Jayro Bustamante came to the town to prepare for his first feature film, \u201cIxcanul\u201d (\u201cVolcano\u201d). He wanted to tell a story of Maya women that addressed issues like endemic poverty and inequities in education and health care, and he was determined to cast Maya actors speaking the Indigenous language of Kaqchikel.",
      "Mr. Bustamante initially put up a sign in the town\u2019s central park: Casting Here. No one showed up. A few days later he posted: Work Here. He was overwhelmed with prospective actors.",
      "Ms. Coroy missed the audition. But a friend put her in touch with the director the next day.",
      "\u201cHe told me I was the only person who looked him in the eye,\u201d she said. When he offered her the lead, she balked. \u201cI had no experience. I was afraid I would ruin the movie.\u201d",
      "But he convinced her to join the cast. For the next several months, they trained at the country\u2019s first film academy, founded by Mr. Bustamante.",
      "\u201cWhen we began filming, they were no longer amateur actors,\u201d Mr. Bustamante said.",
      "\u201cIxcanul,\u201d which ",
      " at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, focuses on a poor family in the mountains that arranges for the daughter to marry a plantation overseer. The daughter secretly gets involved with a young man, a drunk and a dreamer, who promises to take her with him to the United States. But he leaves without her and she finds herself pregnant while still engaged to the other man.",
      "After she gives birth in a hospital, a staff member tells her that her baby has died. When the young woman finds out later that her child had lived and had possibly been sold for adoption, grief consumes her.",
      "\u201cQuiet and fearless,\u201d the Los Angeles-based film critic Manuel Betancourt wrote of Ms. Coroy\u2019s understated performance, which revealed anguish behind a still face.",
      "\u201cI mouthed the words I was feeling in my head,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, explaining her acting method. \u201cIt was easier then because I was naturally timid. I\u2019m much more animated now.\u201d",
      "Her second film with Mr. Bustamante, \u201cLa Llorona,\u201d transformed a traditional Latin American ghost story into an indictment of a fictional dictator, but one clearly reminiscent of the Guatemalan leader, Gen. Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt. Five years before ",
      ", General R\u00edos Montt was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity for the systematic slaughter of Maya men, women and children in the 1980s after he took control of the country in a coup.",
      "Ms. Coroy plays Alma, a Maya housemaid whose son and daughter were among those murdered. A spectral figure in white, she haunts the dictator in his home.",
      "A casting director saw her in the two Bustamante films and picked her for the part of an Indigenous guerrilla in \u201c",
      ",\u201d an American film starring Julianne Moore. For two-and-a-half months, Ms. Coroy filmed in Mexico and the United States, the longest she had ever been away from her family. She froze in New York, she said, and didn\u2019t like the food.",
      "The actress prefers not to discuss politics. But Mr. Bustamante said artists in Guatemala worked in an increasingly hostile climate.",
      "\u201cYou realize you\u2019re in a country where there is a dictatorship without that name,\u201d Mr. Bustamante wrote in an email interview. \u201cThere is a murky sort of oppression and no rights or freedom.\u201d",
      "When \u201cIxcanul\u201d was released, he wrote, \u201cthere was a general rejection by the Guatemalan people of this sort of subject matter. With La Llorona, it was much more dangerous. We received anonymous threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cWakanda Forever,\u201d a global blockbuster distributed by Disney, also addresses the oppression of the Maya.",
      "Ms. Coroy\u2019s character, Princess Fen, catches smallpox brought by the Spaniards to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in the 16th century. A shaman gives her a drink that allows her to live and give birth underwater. When her winged son Namor, played by the Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta, returns to the Yucat\u00e1n, he sees Spaniards beating the Maya they have enslaved.",
      "In Guatemala, some Maya families encourage their children to speak only Spanish and wear Western clothing to escape ongoing rampant discrimination. But that\u2019s not how Ms. Coroy was raised.",
      "\u201cMy parents tell me I should be proud,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who eventually returned to night school and finished college. \u201cThere is no way that you can hide that you\u2019re Indigenous.\u201d",
      "She has recently begun delving into Maya spirituality. Her grandmother was a natural healer who taught her about the curative properties or herbal teas and flowers. While she worships in a Catholic church, she also studies with an Indigenous spiritual teacher and reads the Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh.",
      "Central to Maya religion is Maxim\u00f3n, a trickster deity both benevolent and hedonistic. In ceremonies, adherents smoke and drink in front of his wooden figure in the hopes he will hear their entreaties. Ms. Coroy attends ceremonies without imbibing, she said.",
      "\u201cI respect Maxim\u00f3n,\u201d she said. \u201cI have connected with him in dreams. He said, \u2018You neither speak well of me nor poorly, so I will protect you.\u2019\u201d",
      "While she\u2019s famous enough in Guatemala that people in the colonial tourist city of Antigua, a UNESCO World heritage site, approach her politely for autographs, her neighbors in Santa Mar\u00eda avoid singling her out. Walking in the town\u2019s park, she might as well be any other vendor.",

The couple, who have three children (and a fourth on the way), looked for homes in Westfield, Mountainside, Madison and other communities, but \u201cfinding a four-bedroom house in the $500,000 range was just unheard-of in those towns,\u201d Mr. Montano said.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t find Coxsackie \u2014 I found the house,\u201d said Mr. Readence, an executive coach for a large consulting firm, who now splits his time between Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Coxsackie. \u201cAfter sheltering for four months in an 800-square-foot apartment with my partner and our dog, I was on Zillow looking for places in the upstate area. When we saw the cottage and the town and learned a little more about it, it was really appealing to be a part of its renaissance.\u201d",
      "Perched on the west bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles south of Albany, Coxsackie covers roughly 37 square miles \u2014 including an eponymous 2.17-square-mile village \u2014 with a population of 8,382, according to the 2020 census. The nearly five-acre Riverside Park, adjacent to the downtown area, offers stunning views.",
      "\u201cYou just have beautiful, open park space and the most pristine riverfront,\u201d said Aaron Flach, 47, a developer and a Coxsackie native. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful natural landscape that sets us apart from any other community.\u201d",
      "Just a few years ago, Coxsackie\u2019s historic downtown was pocked with boarded-up buildings. Now the Reed Street Historic District has boutique businesses like the Reed Street Bottle Shop and the antiques store UnQuiet. On a six-acre riverside site, Mr. Flach is building a $15 million hospitality project that includes a 47-room hotel with a top-floor restaurant and deck, and a spa inside a restored electric light station. Last November, he opened a 13,000-square-foot event space in a 1906 factory adjoining the hotel site, with a glass atrium overlooking the river. Called The Wire, after the wire manufacturer that once owned the building, it has 27 events booked so far in 2023.",
      "The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation recently made $3.2 million worth of improvements to Riverside Park, including the construction of a pavilion and renovations to the boat launch. And in 2021, the state\u2019s Main Street grant program awarded $347,000 to the Reed Street Historic District to help preserve and protect its buildings.",
      "\u201cBetween Mr. Flach\u2019s project and the park, our entire riverfront area will have been renovated,\u201d said Mark Evans, 57, a Coxsackie native who has been the mayor of the village since 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place on the Hudson.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach, he added, is renovating buildings that \u201chad been vacant since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "The boutique shops popping up in historic buildings near the waterfront have helped the area approach \u201ccritical mass,\u201d said Sarah Gray Miller, 51, a former magazine editor and self-described \u201cmad collector\u201d from Natchez, Miss., who opened UnQuiet in December 2021 after selling her house in nearby ",
      "Her store occupies a 2,400-square-foot, late-19th-century brick building, once the site of a firehouse and a jail, which Ms. Miller rents for $2,500 a month.",
      "Ms. Miller began serving customers wine on Saturday afternoons and soon found herself holding a regular B.Y.O.B. gathering that evolved into a plan to open a bar with Mark Deubert, a fourth-generation Coxsackie resident. Named Ravish Liquors, after a neon sign Ms. Miller found at a Hudson, N.Y., flea market, it is expected to open this month with a Southern bar-food menu that includes crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e.",
      "Coxsackie \u201cis a very civilized place,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly welcoming to all the outsiders moving in. It does not have the same us-versus-them mentality that you see elsewhere in Greene County.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach bought the waterfront property he is developing from the Twelve Tribes \u2014 a ",
      " that runs a chain of cafes called the Yellow Deli, including one in downtown Coxsackie \u2014 for $1 million, along with an 1860s opera house where he plans to create first-floor retail space and 10 apartments. \u201cThis is a huge project for such a small community,\u201d said Mr. Flach, who\u2019s aiming to open the hotel on June 1. \u201cI want to develop a level of vibrancy for the downtown that will bring tourists to the area and support local businesses.\u201d",
      "He also owns more than 100 apartments in town, including two historic brick buildings from the 1880s, and said they are all occupied, with waiting lists.",
      "Historic homes predominate in the village. Outside the village, Coxsackie\u2019s architecture is a mix of styles, with a number of Greek Revival farmhouses reflecting the area\u2019s agrarian past.",
      "The Reed Street Historic District consists of two- and three-story Italianate brick buildings from the mid-1800s, many painted in soft pastels. Small shops that recently have sprung up include Mansion + Reed General Store, which offers specialty groceries, espresso and pastries; Shipwrecked News, Books & Caf\u00e9, which sells sandwiches, homemade bagels, used books, and just received a liquor license; and, a few doors down, the Reed Street Bottle Shop, which carries local wines and spirits, as well as T-shirts and coffee mugs emblazoned with the phonetic spelling of the town\u2019s often mispronounced name: \u201ccook-SAH-kie.\u201d",
      "Susan Baldaserini, an owner of the wine shop and a graphic artist, designed the shirts and mugs. \u201cNow a weekend doesn\u2019t go by where I don\u2019t hear someone in the shop saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s how you say it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In 2015, when Ms. Baldaserini, 43, and her boyfriend and business partner, Shai Kessler, 45, were living in Red Hook, Brooklyn, they bought a weekend house in the neighboring town of New Baltimore. They moved upstate full-time in 2016 to open the wine shop. The following year, Ms. Baldaserini opened Pilothouse Paper, a stationery store that doubles as her graphic-design studio, across the street.",
      "\u201cA lot of people travel up and down 9W without ever knowing Reed Street exists, but if you get the hot tip to turn off 9W and onto Reed Street, it\u2019s truly charming and idyllic,\u201d she said.",
      "As Coxsackie\u2019s profile has risen, so have its home prices. The median sale price for a single-family home in 2022 was $291,000 \u2014 a jump of nearly 22 percent (from $239,000) in 2021, and nearly 53 percent (from $190,500) in 2019. It was more than the $285,000 median sale price in ",
      ", and less than the $329,500 median in ",
      ", according to the Columbia Greene Board of Realtors.",
      "Taxes are relatively low. The average county, town and school tax bill for 2021 was about $4,443 for town residents and $6,188 for village residents, said Raymond Ward, the director of real property tax services for Greene County.",
      "In mid-January, Zillow showed six single-family homes for sale in Coxsackie, from a three-bedroom ranch on 0.23 acres, listed for $189,100, to a six-bedroom home on 9.33 acres along the Hudson River, listed for $899,000.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been seeing is the people who are interested in being full-time also want to either open up a business here or do a satellite of what they\u2019re already doing in the city,\u201d said Dave Merchant, a Coxsackie native and a real estate agent at Keller Williams Hudson Valley North.",
      "Amy Bennett, who owns two businesses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, is shopping for commercial space in Coxsackie to open a farm stand. She splits her time between her Fort Greene brownstone and her Coxsackie house, but plans to spend most of her time upstate once her younger daughter graduates from high school. In addition to Greene Grape Wine & Spirits and Greene Grape Provisions, she owns five properties in Athens, including 58 acres of farmland.",
      "\u201cCoxsackie feels like it\u2019s got big energy from the waterfront development,\u201d said Ms. Bennett, 53, who bought her three-bedroom Victorian house with river views for $375,000 in May 2021. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a bigger rejuvenation going on all at once.\u201d",
      "She likes to grab coffee at Shipwrecked, pick up cream puffs at the Little Bake Shop on Mansion Street and explore the Coxsackie Antique Center in the West Coxsackie business district on Route 9W, where more than 100 antiques dealers sell their wares. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you want for a rainy Saturday, to wander through and see things you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d she said.",
      "Students in the Coxsackie-Athens Central School District attend either Coxsackie Elementary School or Edward J. Arthur Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade. They go on to Coxsackie-Athens Middle School for fifth through eighth grade, and then to Coxsackie-Athens High School.",
      "During the 2020-21 school year, the latest year for which figures were available from the New York State Education Department, the district had an enrollment of 1,188 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. About 85 percent identified as white, 8 percent as Hispanic, 5 percent as multiracial, 2 percent as Black and 1 percent as Asian or Pacific Islander.",
      "On 2021-22 state tests, 86 percent of Coxsackie-Athens High School students were proficient in English, 34 percent were proficient in algebra and 54 percent were proficient in geometry, compared with 81 percent, 66 percent and 53 percent statewide. In 2022, the average SAT verbal score was 546, compared with a statewide average of 534; the average math score was 542, versus 533 statewide.",
      "The high school\u2019s graduation rate in 2021 was 89 percent, compared with 86 percent for the state.",
      "Coxsackie is roughly a seven-minute drive from Exit 21B on the New York State Thruway. The drive to the George Washington Bridge takes about two hours, depending on traffic.",
      "The Amtrak train station in Hudson is about a 25-minute drive. Round-trip tickets to New York City cost $62 to $148, depending on when the ticket is bought and whether it is for peak or off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cThe train back on Thursday or Friday is often booked, because the area has gotten so popular,\u201d Ms. Miller said.",
      "The New York State Legislature created the town of Coxsackie in 1788, and the village was incorporated in 1867. The name is derived from an Algonquin word and has had many spellings and various translations over the years, including \u201choot of the owl,\u201d said Michael H. Rausch, the town historian. Coxsackie is also associated with ",

It became a commercial hub, shipping local goods to New York City, Mr. Rausch said. The business district, including Reed Street, began to develop around 1810.",

It\u2019s not as if finding husbands and wives for unpaired offspring hasn\u2019t been a fixation of anxious parents across centuries and civilizations, even if in Europe and the United States, love may have finally entered the chat and stayed long enough to become unexceptional. But for older generations in India, parents\u2019 finding spouses for their children has been the norm for so long that the idea of those same adult children\u2019s marrying for \u201clove\u201d is still alien enough for it to occupy an entirely separate category \u2014 now a reality-TV show.",
      "\u201cIndian Matchmaking,\u201d whose ",
      ", follows the immaculately coifed, highlighted and bejeweled Taparia as she steamrolls through the lives of unhappily single men and women of Indian origin mostly living in America. She promises to find them the spouses of their dreams, as long as they don\u2019t dream for too much. The cast varies (with some fan favorites and villains occasionally brought back) but most are seemingly well-off young people, urbane and cosmopolitan, who run their own businesses and attend boutique workout classes. This season\u2019s standouts include an emergency-room doctor named Vikash, whose god complex extends to referring to himself in the third person as Vivacious Vikash and performing solo dances to Hindi songs at his friends\u2019 weddings (and allowing video of himself doing so to be broadcast on the show); he wants a tall Hindi-speaking girl because he\u2019s really attached to Indian \u201cculture.\u201d There\u2019s Bobby, the over-energetic teacher who performs a math-themed rap that ends with him snarling \u201cmathematics, boiii\u201d at the screen. Arti from Miami lists weekly visits to Costco as her hobby.",
      "The activities that these aspirant matchees choose for the dates they go on (wine tastings, yoga with baby goats) are straight out of gentrified Williamsburg. Interspersed in between these scenes are cameos from their stony-faced parents, astrologers dispensing sex advice, face readers, tarot-card readers and Taparia\u2019s own peremptory admonishments reminding them that they\u2019re never getting everything they want in a partner, so they better start lowering their expectations now.",
      "That she has not yet made a single match resulting in marriage over the course of two seasons and 16 episodes has deterred neither Taparia herself nor the makers of the show from continuing this Sisyphean journey into a third. She is not one to suffer from impostor syndrome or even, apparently, introspection, so her matchmaking methodology remains resolutely unchanged. The only big departure this time around is the expansion of her hunting grounds to Britain, where she commences her reign of terror in London by telling a 35-year-old divorcee named Priya that she \u201cshould not be so much picky.\u201d",
      "To people like me, who grew up in this third-party matchmaking milieu, Sima Taparia or Sima Aunty (a nickname she gives herself) is just that \u2014 an ",
      ", an archetype we\u2019ve known and avoided all our lives: the obnoxious and overbearing relative, neighbor or acquaintance with zero sense of boundaries. But to the global audiences who eagerly lapped up \u201cIndian Matchmaking\u201d during the early months of the pandemic, Taparia was a delightful novelty, in one moment tossing bon mots of conjugal wisdom with the serenity of an all-knowing sibyl (\u201cYou will only get 60 to 70 percent of what you want; ",
      "\u201d) and in the next moment ordering a female client to get rid of her \u201chigh standards\u201d with the brusqueness of a guidance counselor breaking it to an overzealous student that they\u2019re not getting into Harvard.",
      "Throughout history, the coming together of two people in matrimony (holy or otherwise) has never been just about the union itself \u2014 it is the broader institution that reveals the deepest anxieties (financial, religious or racial) undergirding a society. \u201cIndian Matchmaking\u201d bills itself as just any other show about the caprices of trying to find love in a hostile world. It is predicated on the idea that seeking the help of someone as quaintly old-fashioned as a matchmaker is superior to the travails of dating online, where one must undergo far worse indignities like being ghosted or breadcrumbed. Here, at least, relationship expectations are mutual, and after all, what is a \u201cbiodata\u201d (a curiously-named document Taparia uses in her practice) if not the same exaggerated dating-app profile but in r\u00e9sum\u00e9 form and with fewer wince-inducing mentions about loving tacos and pizza.",
      "But in India, the business of parents seeking brides and grooms for their children is a cruel and cutthroat one, having originated as a way to preserve caste endogamy, and it continues to be fraught with violence from every side, a reality that is at odds with the show\u2019s portrayal of the process as a decorous, civilized exchange that takes place over tea and manners. The most pernicious aspects are hidden behind a flimsy veneer of fabricated gentility, apparent in the many euphemistic phrases in which Taparia, the singles she is matching and their parents communicate. The show\u2019s title itself reads like an awkward, faux-anthropological translation, when in reality, the Indian here in \u201cIndian Matchmaking\u201d is merely a stand-in for outrageously wealthy, landed upper-caste Hindus (with an exception here and there).",

      " of \u201csame community.\u201d Openly declaring that you want to marry someone filthy rich would be uncouth, so the words \u201cgood family, good upbringing\u201d are uttered frequently. Women cannot afford to be \u201cpicky.\u201d Women have to be \u201cflexible.\u201d They must also learn how to \u201ccompromise.\u201d My personal favorite of these, though, is \u201cadjust,\u201d one of the hardest-working euphemisms in Indian English, whose meaning linguistically can range from the squeezed addition of a third backside on a bus seat meant to fit only two, to a man\u2019s parents\u2019 demanding that the girl foredoomed to marry their son give up her professional career to pursue full-time daughter-in-law activities. Curiously enough, the men are spared the brunt of such exhortations.",
      "\u201cIn marriage, every desire becomes a decision,\u201d remarked Susan Sontag in 1956, a strikingly trenchant line that I recalled when watching the show\u2019s participants being quizzed about their \u201ccriteria\u201d for a potential spouse. Initially, they start out reciting millennial-speak straight out of the 2012 twee-internet era: the desire for someone \u201ckind\u201d with a \u201csense of humor.\u201d But upon further prodding, out come tumbling the real demands, the decisions that display that their modernity hasn\u2019t yet overcome the inherited prejudices that govern this entire phenomenon. Costco-obsessed Arti cannot help mentioning that her father would have really, really, ",

      "Like most writers, I am afraid that the wrong words will sap the radiance from my most elusive memories \u2014 largely uneventful moments that nonetheless remain charged with luminous feeling: the midsummer cloudburst I saw while reading in my bedroom, its sudden gloom inking the sky like a sorcerer\u2019s tempest; or the drowsy unease that descended when, bolting up in the middle of the night, I was convinced I\u2019d been flung into a mirror dimension while I slept. But I also worry that the ",
      " words will pin down those memories best left swimming just beyond coherence. What if fixing them in language changes them, dims their light? If I can hold, in a sentence or two, the formative mysteries of one childhood afternoon, what\u2019s there left to live for?",
      "But a floor plan cannot disappoint me. There is no simpler architectural drawing: The fiction of a celestial eye, a floor plan describes the barest of physical relations. It is an approximation, a bunch of lines promising neither ambience nor texture. Early last year, I decided to try to sketch floor plans for the many places I\u2019ve lived in long enough to call home. The project\u2019s definitive flatness has freed me from the task of completing a memory, offering instead a scaffold for its unfolding, a way of marking it without risking its betrayal.",
      "Maybe it sounds cold to replace depth and specificity with a diagram whose lines seem to express enclosure. Look again: This is not an image of containment but one of gentle anchoring. Its scant motifs \u2014 which indicate the presence of walls, doorways, stairs \u2014 circumscribe space, but the blankness among them is cavernous with possibility. Like a coloring stencil, a floor plan is an invitation. Its firm outlines seem a more reliable index of reality than my prose. I mark these contours so I can step inside and feel some scant assurance of truth from set parameters. My imagination needs a low fence, a road sign or two.",
      "The first home I mapped in earnest was a small apartment nestled in the hills of my hometown, where Zhuhai city faded into a semirural stretch. On every landing, something was always peeling: walls striated with gray paint like shedding snakes; red and gold ",
      " signs (for good fortune) coming unstuck from the last new year. I started by drawing the living room, marking the front door with an arc, then a box for my bedroom, wherein I sketched a window that I still dream about, even now. Like most other gated suburbs in medium-density Chinese cities, ours was a cluster of nondescript buildings, countless lives piled to the skies. The views were constant: austere vistas of concrete blocks, sometimes snaked with fog. But my window looked out onto a stone wall and the dark hill that rose beyond it, thick with enough forestry and foreboding that for years I recalled it as a looming mountain claimed by wolves.",
      "Sometime in the past decade, that neighborhood was razed for a taller and shinier future. Since there are virtually no photos of the homes I lived in after infancy \u2014 our apartments shrank and their messes ballooned, the novelty of my growing bones waned; back then, the camera was not yet a new, glossy limb but something you fetched for an actual occasion \u2014 I can drop by only through the front door of a dream. Usually, I glide from room to room like a cloud, blown by a strange wind that steers me toward old patterns of living: coming home after school, say, and swerving into the kitchen for a snack, then through the hallway to my bedroom, which had my favorite window. These nocturnal visits are my only way back, which means my recollections of those homes are defined by how I moved through them.",
      "Even when I do see pictures from early childhood, they lack a sense of relation. A snapshot of my melon-cheeked self eating cake on a table tells nothing of the backdoor shortcut to our kitchen, the route I later took to sneak more. As mnemonic devices, photographs are intimidating in their mimetic perfection. If Vermeer conjured a corner of my childhood bedroom on canvas and asked me to finish the rest, I\u2019d have a hard time. I\u2019ve never been interested in faultless replicas, but in keeping what\u2019s left.",
      "Only floor plans have given my memories of movement a tangible form, a shape for the routine motions that made up my days. I have since mapped most of these homes, though there\u2019s one I still avoid: my grandparents\u2019 old apartment, which sits just a few feet from the hospital where I was born. They moved out long ago, so I\u2019ve already forgotten too much. When I try to picture it, rooms dissolve into shadows or recede into impossible horizons.",
      "The week my grandfather died, I dreamed of that apartment for the first time in years. It was banal, the way most dreams are when you\u2019re in them. I walked through the front door and into the living room. I looked out the window and saw my grandfather on the street below. But I remember when the dream logic began to fray, when this sight revealed itself to be exceptional, because in our world of entropy, people die, and you do not see them walking around again. A floor plan is the only way I\u2019ll retain anything of that route to the window. So I\u2019ll map that home someday \u2014 even though the walls have faded, even though nothing can grasp how it feels to move through a dream of home and see someone you love, crossing the street on an ordinary day.",

Without looking up or down, only straight ahead, he leaps from the bridge, his hands and feet stiff like the outstretched wings of a swooping bird.",
      "His descent lasts only a couple of seconds, but the audience surrounding him on the bridge has time to exclaim a collective \u201cOoh!\u201d \u2014 a mixture of admiration and fright. Amir disappears beneath the surface, then, reappearing, quickly swims back to shore, as if nothing had happened. Within moments, he\u2019s climbing back up to the bridge.",
      "With his plunge in the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, Amir and his friends from the local diving club are honoring a tradition that goes back some 400 years \u2014 \u201cto the Middle Ages, during the Ottoman era,\u201d says Amir, wiping his face with a towel. \u201cWe are protecting our cultural heritage and keeping the passage over the bridge clean.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are the guardians of the Mostar Bridge,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first recorded dive from the bridge in Mostar \u2014 known as the Old Bridge, or Stari Most \u2014 took place in the 17th century, around 100 years after its construction. Since 1968, the city has held an annual summer diving competition, which attracts participants from all over the world.",
      "Braving the drop of around 75 feet (it varies with the height of the river), this extreme stunt requires a healthy dose of courage. But as Amir ascends from the river to the bridge, walking past the ancient stone stairs, the picturesque streets, the backdrop of musicians in the bazaar, he has another task. With a hat in his hand, he collects donations from the crowd of onlookers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m done with diving today,\u201d he exclaims, still balancing on the edge of the bridge \u2014 but this time extending his arm toward the crowd. \u201cNow I have to raise some money for our club.\u201d",
      "When I traveled to Bosnia with the photographer Alessio Mamo in July 2021, much of our trip took place in the shadow of the violence that tore through the region in the 1990s, when, as Yugoslavia broke apart, war erupted between three ethnonationalist groups: Orthodox Christian Serbs, Catholic Croats and Bosniaks, or Bosnian Muslims.",

      ", though imminent fears have now calmed. Still, the bridge divers in Mostar offer a welcome sense of distraction and wonderment.

      "\u201cIt was much more difficult and dangerous to dive from the gangway,\u201d Admir tells me. \u201cYou had to take a run-up, with the risk of getting hurt.\u201d But even today, every dive is still a challenge, he says, requiring the utmost concentration.",
      "There are days when Admir dives as many as 10 or 12 times, he says, in the peak tourist season, between July and August. I speak with him during his break, while he sips coffee in the club\u2019s lounge. Behind him on the wall are paintings and pictures of the bridge in different historical eras, and of divers during their marvelous feats.",
      "\u201cAs a young man from Mostar, I almost felt obliged to dive,\u201d he says. \u201cSooner or later, all of us males had to do it, like a rite of passage. I\u2019m among those who never stopped. It\u2019s my job.\u201d",

      "There are operas that are challenging for their sheer technical demands \u2014 the density of Berg\u2019s \u201cLulu\u201d or the heroic immensity of Wagner epics. And then there are those that seem simple but are actually some of the most difficult.",
      "In that second category fall Mozart\u2019s three collaborations with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte \u2014 \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro,\u201d \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d and \u201cCos\u00ec Fan Tutte\u201d \u2014 works of slippery psychology, frank humanity and, crucially, crystalline construction that punishes any mistake onstage or in the orchestra pit.",
      "Particularly tough to stage is \u201cDon Giovanni,\u201d which returns to the Metropolitan Opera ",
      ", with Peter Mattei in the title role. Its score runs nearly three hours with major events at the beginning and end \u2014 Giovanni murders the father of a woman he nearly rapes, then later is dragged to hell \u2014 but little in between other than characters repeating mistakes, as if in loops of unhealthy habits.",
      "Without the hand of a confident director, the story rapidly sags. And, in true operatic fashion, its telling is equally dependent on a conductor\u2019s momentum, and actorly, complex expression from the singers. When all the pieces fall into place, \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d unfurls with a sublime, graceful beauty that a casual listener might find straightforward, even light.",
      "But, the conductor Nathalie Stutzmann said, \u201cthe simpler this opera sounds, the more difficult it is to create.\u201d As she prepares to open the Met\u2019s new \u201cDon Giovanni,\u201d she and two other members of its team \u2014 Ivo van Hove, the director, and Ying Fang, a leading Mozart soprano who stars as Zerlina \u2014 discussed the work\u2019s challenges and gifts. Here are edited excerpts from those conversations.",
      "I\u2019ve seen some famous productions. There was Peter Brook in 1984, with Peter Mattei; it was a minimalist staging but very powerful. I\u2019ve seen Michael Haneke\u2019s in Paris, and that was modern, with Don Giovanni as the C.E.O. of a big firm. And I\u2019ve seen another one in Salzburg by my idol, Patrice Ch\u00e9reau, whose work I used to see in Paris all the time when I was young, with my little car and no money, driving back after the show was over.",
      "A challenge is that it\u2019s very long. The first act is sharp as a knife, and the second is almost repeating the things we have seen, but developing them deeper. And that\u2019s where it gets even more challenging \u2014 there are these buffa parts, that even those huge directors that I\u2019ve seen fail at. They get lost in there. If you start to do comedy, it doesn\u2019t work; then it\u2019s about nothing. You have to deepen the emotions, not play it light or funny, which is not really what it is anyway.",
      "My starting point was something that people often forget: The original title was \u201cIl Dissoluto Punito, Ossia il Don Giovanni\u201d [\u201cThe Rake Punished, or Don Giovanni\u201d]. When I saw this title, a lot of doors opened. Mozart had a clear point of view on the character. I had always found it a bit difficult to accept that Donna Anna is a little bit in love with him while she\u2019s raped in the first scene, and then a few minutes later he kills, without any reason, her father. This man has been idolized as a libertine \u2014 his mission is \u201cViva la libert\u00e0\u201d \u2014 but ",
      " freedom, not the freedom of other people. \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d became for me suddenly a very contemporary opera.",
      "When I studied the score and the text, I discovered that it talks about power structures in our society: Don Giovanni, servants like Leporello, but also the farmers\u2019 community in Masetto. Don Giovanni seduces Masetto\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Zerlina, with the promise of a fabulous future of riches and a house, and all these things. Then there\u2019s the sexual, emotional dominance of Donna Elvira; these power structures are about control at the detriment of others, and Don Giovanni is at the top while the others resist him.",
      "And the libretto is so well written, the characters are all complex and ambivalent individuals. They are a bit like Ingmar Bergman characters: neither good nor bad, just human. So, all of this becomes almost like a description of the times we live in.",
      "The ending can be very difficult, but I wanted Don Giovanni to go to hell, and burn in hell forever. What we show is something you don\u2019t expect. But he, as a person, is a problem that has to be dealt with. And with this ending, now that he is dealt with, everybody can move on with their lives. They have closure. It is actually a conventional, happy ending. But I think that is necessary: You see them taking up daily life, as if they were starting again.",
      "Mozart is a kind of doctor for any singer or musician\u2019s playing: Every note that is not right, every dynamic, every articulation, every balance is hearable immediately. Everything that you can cover in later Romantic music \u2014 you can hide much more in Wagner \u2014 you can\u2019t with Mozart.",
      "This orchestration in \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d is so precise. I\u2019ve never seen in Mozart so many fortepiano dynamics; it\u2019s abrupt and a permanent change of color. Which is interesting, but also tiring and very hard to play for three hours. You can never relax. It is a nonstop race \u2014 a race that goes to the abyss at the end.",
      "The arc of it is already in the first measure of the overture. Those notes are the abyss; you have them again at the end. So you have to build the overture so that people understand. Then there is everything in between.",
      "There is the party, which is a virtuoso moment for the orchestra and singers. A lot is connected to the words, the phrasing, but you cannot do that if you are singing every note \u00e9gal. You don\u2019t have time. So, you have to respect the appoggio [breath support] of the language, and you have to be super strict with the rhythm. When it\u2019s not precise, it\u2019s like a sugar crash. But when it is, it works like a Swiss clock.",
      "I\u2019ll never forget a phrase that I read in a book: Mozart said, one of the most difficult, important and crucial things to realize in playing my music is simply the right tempo. In this opera, it\u2019s one key for me. The phrasing seems simple, but the realization is incredibly difficult. The pulse needs to be organic, and one thing needs to be related to the next.",
      "There are many places where we need to make a connection; for me that is the recitativo. My idea is to make it really alive, and very much about the story. I also include the pianoforte instrument in the arias, sometimes, for joyful moments \u2014 like the kisses of Zerlina, a little bit in the spirit of Mozart, what he would do.",
      "What I try to achieve is less of a gap between the recitativo moments and the arias. Typically at this time, the story was told by the recitativo, and the aria described the feeling. But in this opera, the recitativo has so many stories, while the arias are also telling them. It\u2019s a very modern opera in that respect.",
      "When you sing the music right, Mozart is like medicine, a balm for the voice. It\u2019s indescribably beautiful, and just so genius. But it can be deceptive. It sounds very simple and effortless, but it takes a lot of hard work to achieve that.",
      "You have to have perfect legato, and perfect breath control, to get through a lot of long phrases. Mozart also writes runs with crazy coloratura, as well as some dramatic moments. To do all that requires secure technique. It\u2019s very different from verismo, or Verdi. Clarity and purity: When you\u2019re singing Mozart\u2019s music, you have to use particular muscles to be flexible yet keep the purity of the tone. This is all a testament of healthy, and good, technique.",
      "Mostly in the recitatives, Zerlina gets more dramatic. In the scene right before \u201cBatti, batti,\u201d when she goes back to Masetto after almost being seduced by Don Giovanni, she displays her capability in dealing with Masetto, saying: \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t believe me? Then kill me. Please, let\u2019s just make peace.\u201d It\u2019s completely human, and so relatable. That\u2019s another thing about these roles; you can see yourself, and you know you could be that person.",
      "But to interpret this, you have to be faithful to what Mozart has already written. He is a great vocal composer; a lot of things are already written into the score, stressed in how the language is expressed. If you follow that, the emotions speak for themselves. So, the interpretation has to be a little more strict, but it should seem effortless.",
      "The hard work to do that is in the preparation. You\u2019ve got to know other people\u2019s lines, and be aware and listen to whatever is happening around you. Once you know all that, everything is clear, and you can stop thinking too much and just enjoy being in your character. Then, the beauty of it is just so satisfying. It really is one of the greatest joys."

      "At 7:30 on a crisp January morning, Lakishia Fell-Davis was at the wheel of her car, driving to Westmont, a community in the southern part of Los Angeles County. She was headed to Ninety-Fifth Street Elementary School, where she is both a substitute teacher and a parent of two students. Her daughter, Makayla, who was then 9, nibbled on a bagel; Kevin Jr., her 7-year-old son, looked out the window at the succession of strip malls, body shops and liquor stores. Surgical masks were tucked next to their seats, and disinfectant wipes sat in the central console. Glancing at her children in the rearview mirror, Fell-Davis began a prayer for her children\u2019s safety. But she couldn\u2019t help picturing the classrooms, the cafeteria, the schoolyard \u2014 all those kids, all those teachers, any one of them potentially carrying Covid-19 and breathing the same air as she and her children. ",
      "Fell-Davis was aware that at this point, in 2023, most people treated the pandemic as a thing of the past. For her, though, Covid still poses a real threat: Fell-Davis has Type I diabetes, putting her at higher risk of hospitalization and long-term complications from illness. As such, her experience during the pandemic has shaped how she thinks about her daily life, especially at Ninety-Fifth Street, where she has worked on and off for more than a decade as a substitute teacher and teaching assistant. A Covid diagnosis has potentially disastrous physical, emotional and financial ramifications for her family. She felt much more comfortable when schools in the Los Angeles Unified district were online during the first year and a half of the pandemic and her kids were attending virtually. Sure, they missed their friends, but Makayla and Kevin were both shy and soft-spoken children who had never really strayed far from home. They didn\u2019t seem to mind the arrangement. And back then, Fell-Davis\u2019s mother, who was paralyzed on her left side after surviving stomach cancer and two strokes, could visit them with relative peace of mind despite her poor health.",
      "Her fears were confirmed in the winter of 2021, when her husband, Kevin, caught Covid. He was out of his security guard job for over a week, with only partial sick pay, plunging them into a brief period of financial stress. Credit-card bills were due, as was her husband\u2019s life-insurance payment. The entire family got sick. \u201cAm I going to die?\u201d Kevin Jr. asked. The pandemic had overshadowed most of his young life and took its toll on his psyche. He would become agitated, sometimes crying, if he saw someone who wasn\u2019t wearing a mask. Even as Fell-Davis assured him that he wouldn\u2019t die, her bout with the virus confined her to her bedroom for three days with body aches and a fever. Horrified that his mother couldn\u2019t get out of bed, the boy asked, instead, if ",
      " was going to die.",
      "Fell-Davis cried when she learned that in the fall of 2021, ",
      ". Her home \u2014 a cozy two-bedroom apartment in a calm neighborhood \u2014 had become her haven, the place where she had more control over her family\u2019s health than she had anywhere else. She was stressed about whether she might get sick, but she was also nervous about the vaccines, which the district had mandated for most employees. What was in them, she wondered, and how were they made so quickly? But she decided that she had to go back. Her husband couldn\u2019t handle the bills himself, and while she preferred that her children learn remotely for as long as the pandemic lasted, she also wanted them to know how to carry themselves among other people. To her son, anything outside the apartment was scary. If he didn\u2019t have a mask on in public, he\u2019d put his shirt over his mouth, as if hiding. She didn\u2019t want to raise him to fear the world.",
      "As Fell-Davis turned down 96th Street, parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles walked kids to the school fence. The families at Ninety-Fifth Street Elementary were mostly Black and Latino \u2014 except, teachers like to point out, for the Russian family that enrolled a few years back. Looking once more at her children through the rearview mirror, Fell-Davis reminded them of her rules. Wash your hands. Wear your masks. Don\u2019t share snacks.",
      "At Ninety-Fifth Street, 94 percent of students live in poverty; many parents work essential jobs and suffer from chronic illness. The school, and other poor communities in Los Angeles, have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. In California, where the earnings gap between high- and low-income families is among the widest in the country, the pandemic has clarified inequality\u2019s consequences. The life expectancy for Latinos in California has decreased by approximately six years; for Black Californians, four years. In Los Angeles County, where Latinos make up nearly half the population, their overall mortality rate has increased more than any other racial or ethnic group. Among the hardest-hit areas have been East and South Los Angeles, which are home to lower-income Latino and Black families who work essential jobs, may live in multigenerational houses without room to distance and suffer higher rates of chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes. In Westmont, 384 of every 100,000 ",
      ", compared with 113 in the affluent Westside neighborhood of Brentwood, near U.C.L.A.",
      "But elsewhere in Los Angeles, and the rest of the country, most people have embraced the \u201creturn to normal\u201d so central to the nation\u2019s idea of Covid recovery. Before the start of the new school year, L.A.U.S.D. rolled back most of its remaining Covid protocols, doing away with mandatory masking and testing. In an interview that aired in September, President Biden declared the pandemic \u201cover.\u201d At the end of February, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, ",

      " for schoolchildren died down.",
      "The burden of navigating Covid\u2019s risks now falls on the individual, and what \u201cpost-pandemic\u201d means for one person or community, like Ninety-Fifth Street Elementary, looks wildly different than it does for others. In the United States, more than 200 people are still dying of Covid every day, and thousands are still being hospitalized for the disease. Barbara Ferrer, director of the county\u2019s department of public health, has frequently acknowledged that inequality in experience and warned that broad rollbacks of safety measures do not signify that Covid has vanished. \u201cFor people who are at higher risk, Covid remains a potentially dangerous virus,\u201d she says. There\u2019s a \u201cworrisome myth that we know is circulating, that Covid is like a cold or, you know, like the flu, and people don\u2019t really need to worry about it. That may be true for many people. But for some people, it\u2019s absolutely not true.\u201d",
      " Ninety-Fifth Street Elementary School last fall, and found that the collective psyche of the community had shifted from crisis to a quieter grieving. By comparison, loss was acute during the pandemic\u2019s first year. \u201cA lot of families lost not just one or two, but four or five, six people,\u201d says Kissten O\u2019Brien, one of Ninety-Fifth Street\u2019s psychiatric social workers. Teachers were de facto grief counselors for students and sometimes even parents. Many of them set learning standards aside; most classroom time was spent making sure their students were safe and stable.",
      "Los Angeles parents fell into two camps on the issue of school reopening. It was obvious that the school closures L.A.U.S.D. ordered on March 16, 2020, set students back academically and socially, and some parents protested and even tried suing the district to force reopening, while others preferred not to send their children back. The two camps often reflected socio-economic divisions: Many families, often from white, affluent neighborhoods, wanted their kids back in person, according to a ",
      " the district sent out in the spring 2021 semester. But families in low-income neighborhoods, where death rates were high and vaccination rates were low, were hesitant. When students did return fully in person in the fall of 2021, the district imposed fairly strong safety precautions: Anyone entering campus had to complete a form attesting that they were not symptomatic for Covid, and all students and staff were required to wear masks and take weekly PCR tests. Laura Crespo, a fifth-grade teacher at Ninety-Fifth Street, told me that for many of her students\u2019 apprehensive parents, even if the weekly testing did not make them feel totally comfortable, it at least prepared them to acquiesce to in-person instruction. But once students were back, the depth of their loss was palpable. That October, the hallways brimmed with photos, sugar skulls and pan dulce \u2014 D\u00eda de los Muertos offerings meant to commemorate deceased loved ones. ",
      "In February 2022, Alberto Carvalho, the former Miami-Dade school district superintendent, took the helm of L.A.U.S.D. Just after he started the job, ",
      " In the fall of 2022, the beginning of the current school year, ",
      " most of its preventive measures and replaced them with the honor system, requesting that only those experiencing Covid symptoms or who reported exposures to Covid test themselves. To the consternation of some teachers and parents at Ninety-Fifth Street, gone were masks, distancing and now weekly tests. Some parents still sent their kids to school with masks and prohibited them from partaking in activities like field trips. Others, though, told me they weren\u2019t very concerned.",
      "In this new phase of Covid, what constituted safety was still up for debate, leading to a vague sense of disquiet among the teachers. But Crespo, who has asthma and a combination of other undiagnosed conditions that limit her respiratory capacity, felt adamant that Covid was still serious. In fact, I\u2019d met her through a parent at another school whose campaign to make and distribute air filters across the district she had supported. Crespo was a popular campus figure who often served as an intermediary between the school administration and parents, especially Spanish speakers. She was born and raised in Central Los Angeles; her parents were Salvadorans who fled civil war. Accordingly, she was sympathetic to her students\u2019 stories. Like most of them, she grew up poor and frequently changed homes. When she was a child in Los Angeles public schools, she felt that some of her teachers couldn\u2019t relate to, or even understand, their students\u2019 hunger or financial struggles. She wanted to be the kind of teacher she needed as a child, so she noticed when a student seemed morose or agitated, and she\u2019d pull them aside to ask what was going on at home. At the beginning of the pandemic, when her students\u2019 relatives were sick and dying, and they could hardly even log on to virtual school, it was clear that the children needed to know they were not alone.",
      "Many parents were still stressed about Covid, Crespo told me, and asked her to make sure their kids were wearing masks. She texted and called frequently to check in on their home lives or update them on campus events. Parents were grateful; almost weekly, a mother sends her child to school with homemade baleadas; others send tamales. When I was at the school, a chatty girl or two often trailed behind her as she walked campus during recess; a gaggle usually ate lunch in her classroom.",
      "In December, Crespo brought me to her desk, which was strewn with hot-chocolate packets from the class\u2019s winter party earlier that morning. She wanted to show me a Google form she\u2019d had students fill out so she could get a better sense of their mental health ahead of the holiday break. Crespo herself had never much liked Christmas, because she associated the holiday with stress; growing up, she couldn\u2019t understand why people would spend precious rent money on a dead pine tree. On the form, she asked what the fifth graders found enjoyable and difficult about the season, and six said they missed dead loved ones. Crespo started sending mental-health surveys to students at the beginning of the pandemic, and the results spoke to the immensity of suffering in their community. In total, 17 of her students had a loved one die during the pandemic\u2019s first year. ",
      "Later that day, she learned that a student had acted up during recess, and she sat with him in the back corner of the classroom while his classmates were working independently. As they talked quietly, he revealed that his parents had died when he was young; the loss became especially haunting during the holidays. Crespo sent him to the classroom of O\u2019Brien, the psychiatric social worker, where printouts of candles, meant to honor loved ones who had died, were stapled to a board. Scrawled children\u2019s handwriting on some candles read \u201cgranddad,\u201d \u201ccousins,\u201d \u201cmy rabbit.\u201d O\u2019Brien told me she noticed that children had become extremely vulnerable to emotional triggers in the wake of the pandemic. A teacher would be talking about, say, a hamburger, maybe in the context of a counting lesson, and suddenly a kid would burst into tears at the memory of someone in their life who used to cook hamburgers.",
      "Once the student left, Crespo told the rest of the class to notify her if a peer seemed upset. \u201cAs you\u2019re going through your day,\u201d she said, \u201cplease remember to treat everyone with respect, to be patient with everyone. Just remember: You don\u2019t know what somebody\u2019s going through.\u201d That same day, when Crespo was introducing a lesson on water and rivers to a separate class of English-language learners, a girl confided that she had lost five people to Covid. Crespo and the girl spoke in Spanish at the side of the room as classmates worked on their own. The girl unspooled a complex story, about not just the pandemic but also the violence she witnessed in Honduras before moving to Los Angeles. Crespo told me that kids came to her because they felt they had no one else to turn to. ",
      "This year, though, Crespo resolved to be more mindful of the toll all this grief \u2014 including her own \u2014 took on her. Her uncle, aunt and grandmother had all recently died, and she wanted to focus on her own mental health. She had recently taken up guitar, and liked to strum along with her brother in their apartment. \u201cMy grief is very much connected to my students\u2019 grief,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much connected to my school community. But I\u2019ve needed time to just let my grief be its own thing.\u201d",
      "holiday break, the school\u2019s principal, Manuel Nava, decided to hold the students\u2019 winter performance outside as a precaution against rising levels of Covid, RSV and flu, and kids sang and danced to Christmas songs under a cloudy Los Angeles sky. But the next day, the faculty had its holiday luncheon inside a small auditorium. To his staff, the principal acknowledged he should be wearing a mask, though he wore one only intermittently. Sixty or so fatigued-yet-talkative staff members piled lasagna and salad onto their plates and ate at long folding tables underneath white string lights. Crespo, one of the few teachers to wear a mask, filled Tupperware with food and ducked out early. The only time she\u2019d caught Covid was in that very auditorium last June. It was bad \u2014 she was bedridden for three weeks \u2014 but it could have been worse had she not already been taking steroids to strengthen her lungs. She sensed that district administrators considered concerns like hers inconvenient, and as she saw it, L.A.U.S.D. was more interested in academic achievement and perfect attendance than in health. She took Covid safety into her own hands by constantly wearing a KN-95 mask and encouraging students to mask as well. Crespo\u2019s modeling seemed to work: Most times I visited, at least half of her students wore masks the entire school day. ",
      "Her thinking underscored the complex reality at Ninety-Fifth Street and in the district at large. The school was as safe as it could be, given its limited tools to mitigate Covid. Administrators gave out masks and tests when requested, and the custodial staff continued to sanitize every day, but they didn\u2019t have the power to mandate anything. As state and federal emergency relief funding has dwindled, L.A.U.S.D. has pulled money for Covid. Chronic absenteeism continues to plague the district, which affects funding: State dollars are tied to average daily attendance, and within L.A.U.S.D., there are sizable disparities in absenteeism between neighborhoods. During the 2021-22 school year, just over 45 percent of students were absent for at least 9 percent of the 180-day academic calendar, qualifying them as chronically absent. Carvalho said that over this school year, attendance rates across the district were slowly improving. A number of factors, including lack of safe transportation, housing instability and illnesses like the flu, affect students\u2019 ability to get to campus, with the health and economic havoc wrought by the pandemic making attending school even more difficult. At Ninety-Fifth Street, where more than 55 percent of students were chronically absent in the 2021-22 school year (the rate is now 44 percent), funding can take some time to come through, and approval for routine updates can be held up by red tape. ",
      "At the luncheon, Fell-Davis and her kids sat near a few other masked teachers, Kevin Jr. with a mask and Makayla without. Fell-Davis wore an exasperated look. Why, she lamented, was it so hard for her daughter to put on a mask? Like Crespo, Fell-Davis was unhappy with the lack of safety protocols at work, but she didn\u2019t blame Ninety-Fifth Street. \u201cI feel protected,\u201d she told me, but at the same time she said that she felt completely vulnerable. The most teachers could do was cultivate a culture of caution. Sometimes, if Fell-Davis saw a sniffling child with tired eyes, she would ask them to put on a mask. She thought that by now, parents wouldn\u2019t send their children to school sick, but she understood that it was difficult for families in which both parents often worked and couldn\u2019t afford to stay home for a day. In November, when she was substituting in a fourth-grade class and checking kids\u2019 double-digit multiplication work, a boy told her she didn\u2019t have to wear her mask. \u201cCovid is over,\u201d he said. The children around him perked up and leaned in to listen, so Fell-Davis stood up and explained to the class that she had Type I diabetes. \u201cJust because everyone says Covid is gone doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s safe for others,\u201d she told them. As the kids lobbed question after question, eager to learn about their teacher\u2019s life, she wondered about the boy\u2019s parents. What were they telling him at home? Some days, Fell-Davis was more nervous about Covid, other days, less. Her views were rather capricious: Though she never changed her safety routine, her view on the severity of Covid\u2019s threat often depended on her mood. ",
      "For her, this stage of Covid is as much about grappling with trauma as it is with confronting the challenges of the present. The pandemic\u2019s emotional fallout is, to Fell-Davis, even more overwhelming than the health risk. Her mother died of septic shock in July 2021, just before Fell-Davis and her kids would return to school. Instead of returning to work at school as she had planned, she stayed home for a year; she couldn\u2019t bear to face condolences from colleagues, and she preferred to untangle her grief in solitude. Her mother had been her moral compass, the person she turned to with all of her troubles, no matter how small. Fell-Davis fell apart. In the mornings, after dropping her kids off at school, she\u2019d sit in her garage and weep for her mother. Sometimes she didn\u2019t make it far from the school curb, and her husband would go out looking for her. ",
      "This past fall, after a year at home mourning and collecting unemployment to help her husband with the bills, Fell-Davis felt she was ready to return to school, but heartache still follows her. Earlier in December, she suffered a panic attack at school while she was preparing to teach a reading lesson, and an ambulance took her to a nearby hospital whose hallways were overcrowded with moaning patients \u2014 a setting that did not subdue her anxiety. In February, as she was turning down her street, she saw a parked ambulance, and her mind flashed to the ambulance that took her mother to the hospital where she eventually died. Another trigger, another day spent weeping. \u201cI just want you to be OK,\u201d her husband told her after her panic attack, when she was missing her mother and her anxiety was through the roof. \u201cIt\u2019s a daily struggle,\u201d Fell-Davis says.",
      "By mid-March, she was feeling more comfortable with the new circumstances around Covid. But often, when we talked, the darkness of memory and stress of the present seemed to wear her down. She\u2019d spent the past three years entirely devoted to her family, caring for their health and hearts. \u201cI\u2019m 41, and I need to do something that I enjoy,\u201d Fell-Davis says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I enjoy.\u201d ",
      "Ninety-Fifth Street Elementary again in late January, the hills outside Los Angeles had transformed from brown to green; white and yellow wildflowers pushed through the soil. Some of the children were antsy on that balmy Wednesday morning: Buses would soon take them to Point Fermin, an outdoor education center on the coast, for a two-night field trip focused on marine science. For many, this was the longest they\u2019d ever been away from their parents. The parents were anxious, too; in the front office, I heard a mother worry that she hadn\u2019t packed her child appropriate clothing. Some were stressed that their children might catch Covid, but Crespo assured them that the camp and school were taking as many precautions as possible. Everyone tested negative before the trip, and parents were comforted by the fact that she, someone who still took Covid seriously, was there to look out for their kids. ",
      "They were in the middle of district testing, with more on the way. It was an especially trying time, even for Ninety-Fifth Street teachers, who were accustomed to working through the educational challenges associated with poverty. Everyone was exhausted: The pandemic had left kids struggling to perform at grade level. Zaira Valadez, a second-grade teacher, told me that many of her students were stuck at kindergarten math levels. \u201cThere\u2019s so much push to have these kids just have good grades, we forget all that trauma they have gone through, everything we have gone through,\u201d she said. With double-digit subtraction, she has tried every trick in the book \u2014 breaking numbers into tens and ones, drawing visuals of the numbers so students can cross them out \u2014 but nothing works. Some rely on their fingers, which is difficult, because they can\u2019t subtract from any number greater than 10. They become frustrated, she becomes frustrated and they start over. ",
      "\u201cI get to the point where I\u2019ve almost wanted to cry,\u201d Valadez said. \u201cAm I doing something wrong?\u201d Crespo said her students were making gains, but they were sick of testing, and still struggling emotionally. \u201cA lot of these tests aren\u2019t made by me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re made by people who are not in my classroom.\u201d She was trying to keep up with district demands, but if the pandemic taught her anything about teaching at Ninety-Fifth Street, it was that students needed to take it slow. The trip gave Crespo and the kids a welcome reprieve from district testing.",
      "Before the buses arrived at the school, I sat in Crespo\u2019s classroom as students ate prepacked cereal, provided through L.A.U.S.D.\u2019s free-breakfast program. The walls were decorated to look like a lush woodland. Marigolds and vines wrapped around an archway, a fake willow tree branched out by her desk and green wallpaper created a backdrop to the class library. As I spent time with her, it seemed as if Crespo had boundless energy. She was also a United Teachers Los Angeles union representative, had recently completed a master\u2019s in science education and was tasked with writing a new science curriculum for fifth graders. But privately, she was feeling depleted from doing all the extra work, attending to her students\u2019 emotional needs and constantly worrying about her health. Most days, when Crespo returned from school, she didn\u2019t leave the house.",
      "She was worn down by the accumulation of stress and grief \u2014 grief for herself and for her students. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to a lot of inequality, where I\u2019m going to keep working toward making sure that all the students get what they need, that they\u2019re treated fairly.\u201d Crespo said of Covid. \u201cI can only do what I can do. No one is going to come in and give our students everything that we need.\u201d Covid inequality was a structural issue like poverty in the school, a problem that no individual could hope to tackle alone. The constant anxiety was grating to the spirit, and she was feeling absent in her own life outside school. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get desensitized,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much worrying I can do.\u201d",
      "Yet, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from worrying \u2014 there was so much to occupy her attention. When I talked to her in mid-March, a few weeks after California retired its pandemic-emergency declaration, Crespo and ",
      " for three days in solidarity with striking cafeteria workers, custodians and bus drivers, among other low-wage workers seeking a new contract. These workers, most of whom are part time employees, were the district\u2019s lowest-paid, on average earning $25,000 annually. (Last month, their union won a new contract that ensures a new average of $33,000 by 2024.)",
      "On the bus, Crespo and the kids rode south for 20 minutes, out of Westmont and toward San Pedro. After they arrived, the kids spread across the campus, binoculars in hand, for their first assignment: identifying aspects of the environment that were similar to, and different from, their own neighborhood. They giggled and zoomed in on their friends\u2019 faces, and looked at the snow on the mountains and a ladybug on a blade of grass. This is good, Crespo thought. It had been a long time since any of them had been able to do something like this, to run around unburdened, if only for a few days. It was yet another experience \u2014 that of simply being a child \u2014 that the pandemic had taken from them. On the second day of the field trip, after a visit to a salt marsh, the kids trudged up a hill, complaining, in the way that homesick children do, about being thirsty and tired, asking Crespo when the hill would end. At the top, they stopped and looked with awe. Before this trip, many kids had never seen the ocean. They stared at the light on the water, the immensity of the view. Crespo and the kids fell quiet, taking it all in.",

      "Texas was gasping for electricity. Winter Storm Uri had knocked out power plants across the state, leaving tens of thousands of homes in icy darkness. By the end of Feb. 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died, some from the freezing cold.",
      "Meanwhile, in the husk of a onetime aluminum smelting plant an hour outside of Austin, row upon row of computers were using enough electricity to power about 6,500 homes as they raced to earn Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.",
      "The computers were performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for an elusive combination of numbers that Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm would accept. About every 10 minutes, a computer somewhere guesses correctly and wins a small number of Bitcoins worth, in recent weeks, about $170,000. Anyone can try, but to make a business of it can require as much electricity as a small city.",
      "In Texas, the computers kept running until just after midnight. Then the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them shut off, under an agreement that allowed it to do so if the system was about to fail. In return, it began paying the Bitcoin company, Bitdeer, an average of $175,000 an hour to keep the computers offline. Over the next four days, Bitdeer would make more than $18 million for not operating, from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm.",
      "The New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as Bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs \u2014 including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution \u2014 for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with Bitcoin.",
      "Until June 2021, most Bitcoin mining was in China. Then it drove out Bitcoin operations, at least for a time, citing their power use among other reasons. The United States quickly became the industry\u2019s global leader.",
      "Since then, precisely how much electricity Bitcoin mines are using in America and their effect on energy markets and the environment have been unclear. The Times, using both public and confidential records as well as the results of studies it commissioned, put the most comprehensive estimates to date on the largest operations\u2019 power use and the ripple effects of their voracious demand.",
      "It is as if another New York City\u2019s worth of residences were now drawing on the nation\u2019s power supply, The Times found.",
      "In some areas, this has led prices to surge. In Texas, where 10 of the 34 mines are connected to the state\u2019s grid, the increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly 5 percent, or $1.8 billion per year, according to a simulation performed for The Times by the energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.",
      "The additional power use across the country also causes as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to America\u2019s roads, according to an analysis by WattTime, a nonprofit tech company. Many of the Bitcoin operations promote themselves as environmentally friendly and set up in areas rich with renewable energy, but their power needs are far too great to be satisfied by those sources alone. As a result, they have become a boon for the fossil fuel industry: WattTime found that coal and natural gas plants kick in to meet 85 percent of the demand these Bitcoin operations add to their grids.",
      "Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, like factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.",
      "In some states, notably New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, Bitcoin operators\u2019 revenue can ultimately come from other power customers. The clearest example is Texas, where Bitcoin companies are paid by the grid operator for promising to quickly power down if necessary to prevent blackouts. In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down and instead earn additional money while doing exactly what they would have been doing anyway: seeking Bitcoin. Five operations have collectively made at least $60 million from that program since 2020, records show.",
      "Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.",
      "The windfall for Bitdeer during Winter Storm Uri came through this program, in exchange for a fraction of the power it typically used. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Another Bitcoin company made tens of millions of dollars reselling electricity during the storm \u2014 and ultimately stands to earn as much as $125 million \u2014 according to its financial filings, which were previously reported by the ",

      "\u201cIronically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid,\u201d said Ed Hirs, who teaches energy economics at the University of Houston and has been critical of the industry.",
      "In interviews and statements, many of the companies said they were no different from other large power users except for their willingness to shut off quickly to benefit the grid. Several objected to the method The Times and WattTime used to estimate their emissions, which calculated the pollution caused by the additional power generated to satisfy the mines\u2019 demand, showing it to overwhelmingly come from fossil fuels.",
      "The companies said this method held them to an unfair standard.",
      "\u201cThe analysis cited could be used to attack any industry that consumes power,\u201d said David Fogel, the chief executive of Coinmint, which operates in upstate New York. \u201cI think the entire notion of singling out specific industries like this is unfair.\u201d",
      "But WattTime\u2019s method is the one many energy and climate experts recommend for measuring the environmental effects of increased power use by any industry, particularly one that grows so large so suddenly.",
      "Some in the industry have pushed back against suggestions that it is directly responsible for any environmental harm.",

      " to the Environmental Protection Agency, signed by many of the biggest companies, said their operations \u201creleased\u201d no pollutants. \u201cBitcoin miners have no emissions whatsoever,\u201d it said. \u201cAssociated emissions are a function of electricity generation.\u201d",
      "Nic Carter, a partner at a crypto-focused venture capital firm and a",
      "prominent Bitcoin advocate who told The Times he was the letter\u2019s primary author, said he was playing a \u201clanguage game\u201d when he wrote that Bitcoin mining has no emissions. At the time, he said, he felt the industry was being unfairly singled out.",
      "\u201cMaybe the more sincere point is like, we\u2019re already fully aware of the emissions associated with utilities generating grid power,\u201d he said.",
      "Many academics who study the energy industry said Bitcoin mining was undoubtedly having significant environmental effects.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re adding hundreds of megawatts of new demand when we already face the need to rapidly cut fossil power,\u201d said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor who studies electrical grid emissions.",

      "Bitcoin, conceived in 2008, introduced most of the world to the concept of cryptocurrencies. Instead of trusting banks to track the value of accounts, the system publishes transactions on a public ledger called a blockchain. Proponents said that cutting out middlemen would free people from financial institutions, government oversight and fees.",
      "So-called mining is a fundamental part of the system: When a computer guesses correctly, it updates the ledger and collects six and a quarter new Bitcoins. Then the guessing game begins again.",
      "Initially, hobbyists could win with personal computers, but as the value of each Bitcoin soared \u2014 from under $1,000 in 2017 to above $60,000 in 2021 \u2014 mining increasingly became an industrial endeavor. (The price has since dropped and, as of publication, was roughly $28,000.)",
      "The only way for miners to better their odds is to add computing power, which requires more electricity. But as the number of guesses increases, the algorithm makes the game more difficult. This has created an energy arms race.",
      "The mines\u2019 scale can draw gasps from people in the power industry. A one-megawatt mine consumes more energy each day than a typical U.S. home does in two years. The electricity coursing through a 100-megawatt operation at a given moment could power about half the homes in Cleveland, according to federal data.",

      " in news articles and ",
      " and ",
      ", including broad estimates of the environmental effects. But The Times cross-referenced financial disclosures, land records and satellite imagery to create the first national accounting of the biggest operations. The analysis includes mines operating at approximately 40 megawatts or higher, although dozens more exist below that threshold.",
      "Of course, other industries, including metals and plastics manufacturing, also require large amounts of electricity, causing pollution and raising power prices. But Bitcoin mines bring significantly fewer jobs, often employing only a few dozen people once construction is complete, and spur less local economic development.",
      "Their financial benefit flows almost exclusively to their owners and operators. In 2021, the year Bitcoin\u2019s price peaked, 20 executives at five publicly traded Bitcoin companies together received nearly $16 million in salary and over $630 million in stock options, records show.",
      "The industry has been less profitable since then, as Bitcoin\u2019s value has dropped and electricity prices have climbed. Two of the largest United States-based companies have filed for bankruptcy. Still, new mines continue to open across the country",
      "There are ways to operate a cryptocurrency using far less electricity. Last year, Ethereum, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, reduced the electricity needed to power the network by more than 99 percent by switching its algorithm. Now it rewards people and trusts them to update the ledger because they are willing to put up their own money as collateral, not because they have spent money to power guessing computers, as Bitcoin does.",
      "But Bitcoin advocates oppose changing their algorithm, saying that it has proved resistant to attacks for longer and at a greater scale than any other approach. In practice, they say, the more computers making guesses, the safer the network.",
      "As Bitcoin mining has spread, countries around the world have found that operations strained their power grids. In 2019, China declared the industry \u201c",
      "\u201d and banned it in 2021. Many operations moved to ",

      "They are working to cool more than 30,000 computers, stacked two stories high, stretching for hundreds of feet alongside signs that read \u201cDanger \u2014 High Voltage.\u201d The radiating heat melts the snow on one side of each of the operation\u2019s eight buildings.",
      "The mine has 33 employees and uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as all the homes in the 16,000-person town. It is one of three mines in the state that together consume nearly as much power as every home in North Dakota.",
      "Few other states have been as welcoming to Bitcoin companies. In October 2021, Gov. Doug Burgum presented an ",

      "The Bitcoin operations\u2019 effect on the state\u2019s economy is simple, said Josh Teigen, the commerce commissioner: \u201cThey are propping up our fossil fuel industry, and that\u2019s exactly what we want.\u201d",
      "North Dakota has an abundance of lignite, a type of coal primarily used to generate electricity. Mr. Teigen said the state hopes to ultimately",
      "capture the carbon from fossil fuel power plants and store it underground, reducing emissions while keeping the coal industry alive",

      "Applied Digital, said Wes Cummins, its chief executive.",
      "His company is not alone. Many Bitcoin businesses promote their ability to operate in rural areas where renewable energy is abundant.",
      "But those claims have hit a hard reality: A vast majority of that renewable energy would be used even in the absence of the mines, so fossil fuel plants almost always need to produce additional electricity as a result of their operations.",
      "For example, the Jamestown mine\u2019s power demand causes coal or natural gas energy providers to generate electricity more than 90 percent of the time, WattTime found.",
      "Using a technique known as ",
      ", WattTime examined each mine\u2019s location and power use, identified which types of power plants had generated the additional energy needed, and estimated the resulting pollution. That method, and WattTime in particular, were recommended in a report by the Crypto Climate Accord, an initiative to reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint supported by more than 200 cryptocurrency companies.",
      "The analysis found that the 34 mines\u2019 power use was causing nearly 16.4 million tons of carbon pollution each year.",

He said his operation uses the electricity that is available on the grid and cannot control whether it comes from clean or dirty sources, which is affected by all customers\u2019 demand. The miners generally prefer calculating emissions based on that mix of power.",
      "Using that method, WattTime estimated that they consume 54 percent fossil fuel-generated power, resulting in nearly 10.4 million tons of carbon emissions.",
      "Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, a Bitcoin lobbying group, said in an email that the industry incentivizes the development of new renewable and natural gas plants. But power industry experts say that while some current wind farms may be benefiting modestly, renewable generation takes years to build and usually requires commitments from customers who can guarantee that they will buy power for a decade or more.",
      "According to Dr. Jenkins at Princeton, the Bitcoin operations\u2019 near-constant power demand is more likely to keep fossil fuel plants in business than to lead to more renewable energy.",
      "This proved true in upstate New York, where a gas-powered plant reopened and now powers a Bitcoin mine. Three other large operations are run by companies that also own the fossil fuel plants where they operate, including two burning waste coal in Pennsylvania.",
      "Some of the Bitcoin companies that WattTime found to be causing the most pollution have held themselves out as supporting renewables.",
      "For example, Riot Platforms\u2019 chief executive described Bitcoin mining as \u201cuniquely beneficial and supportive of renewable energy.\u201d Ninety-six percent of the power demand added by the company\u2019s mine was met by fossil fuels, the WattTime analysis showed.",
      "Mining Bitcoin produces steady revenue, but using so much electricity can also be a business model.",
      "Moments of extreme weather provide especially stark examples. Take June 23, 2022 \u2014 the eighth straight day of near-100-degree temperatures around Austin, which allowed Riot Platforms to demonstrate several ways they can turn electricity into money.",
      "Like many industrial buyers, the company had prepurchased its power at a fraction of the price available to residential customers. Riot\u2019s mine runs at 450 megawatts \u2014 the largest in the country.",
      "Each day that June, its computers\u2019 guesses were winning Bitcoin worth an average of about",
      "$342,000. But the company had two additional ways to improve its profit margins.",
      "First, it had signed up for the Responsive Reserve Service, a Texas power grid program that offers a way to quickly reduce strain if the grid becomes overloaded, acting as insurance against blackouts. The program pays miners, and other companies, for promising to stop using electricity upon request. In reality, they are rarely asked to shut down, but are still paid for making the pledge.",
      "From midnight to nearly 4 p.m. on June 23, Riot earned more than $42,000 from the program while continuing to mine Bitcoin. (Overall in 2022, Riot made nearly $9.3 million from participating in the program nearly 85 percent of the time, the data shows, though the grid operator asked companies to actually lower their use for about 3.5 hours.)",
      "Around that time, the company switched to the second technique: avoiding fees that Texas charges to maintain and strengthen the power grid. It did so by briefly shutting off almost completely.",
      "To incentivize big customers to conserve electricity, those fees are based on how much electricity they use during several peak summer moments. Riot reduced its power use by more than 99 percent.",
      "By 6:30 p.m., the company had resumed mining. If Riot had been fully operating all day, it would have incurred an estimated $5.5 million in fees \u2014 costs that are largely made up by other Texans. Over the course of the year, this saved Riot more than $27 million in potential fees.",
      "The company\u2019s actions were described in data published by the Texas grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT. Though the records refer to power suppliers by pseudonyms, The Times was able to identify six of the 10 Texas operations in the data.",
      "One final mechanism lets some companies make extra money when electricity prices spike: They can stop mining and resell electricity to other customers. That earned Riot roughly $18 million last year.",
      "From Bitcoin mining, the company earned $156.9 million last year.",
      "Five of the six Texas mines in the power grid data participate in the Responsive Reserve program. All six chose to turn off nearly every time fees were assessed in 2022, saving an estimated $62 million in fees.",
      "When asked whether Bitcoin companies are disproportionately able to take advantage of both programs, ERCOT said in a statement that it \u201cdoes not discriminate based on the type or activity\u201d of the companies that sign up.",
      "It is not unusual for companies in Texas to be able to anticipate moments when fees will be assessed and to reduce their demand, but unlike Bitcoin miners, most can stop using on average 5 percent to 30 percent of their electricity, industry consultants say.",
      "In a statement, Riot said it reducing its power load helped all power customers.",
      "\u201cThe company\u2019s decision to actively reduce its load during anticipated times of peak demand adds to grid reliability and ultimately helps to reduce peak power prices,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Mr. Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council said the benefits outweigh the cost.",
      "\u201cIn addition to providing jobs and positive economic impact, Bitcoin miners turn off when power prices rise and that power is then available for commercial and residential users,\u201d he said.",
      "Others say the companies are capitalizing on weaknesses in programs designed for very different industries.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re exploiting the system,\u201d said Severin Bornstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies electricity pricing. \u201cBut they will say, \u2018You know, the system was already there,\u2019 and I\u2019m sympathetic to that in some ways.\u201d",
      "After accounting for the savings and revenue from each of the strategies, Riot told investors its electricity cost in 2022 was 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour.",
      "By comparison, the average price for other industrial businesses in Texas was 7.2 cents.",
      "For",
      "residents, it was 13.5 cents.",
      "These opportunities have led some of the country\u2019s largest Bitcoin operations to choose Texas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a massive financial burden to Texans,\u201d said Ben Hertz-Shargel, who leads grid-related research at Wood Mackenzie, and was part of the team that conducted the market-based simulation for The Times based on historical ERCOT data. Because of how the Texas market operates, the increases are steepest for residential customers, said Mr. Hertz-Shargel, who has previously criticized Bitcoin\u2019s dependence on electricity as \u201cinessential.\u201d",
      "Others say increased prices will incentivize the development of cheaper types of power generation.",
      "\u201cExpanding Texas generation is crucial, and allowing different energy sources to compete in the market will help drive down prices,\u201d said Gideon Powell, chief executive at Cholla, an energy exploration company in Texas that is developing Bitcoin mines.",
      "As of last month, ERCOT had approved plans to connect an additional ",
      " of Bitcoin operations this year, which would nearly triple their consumption in Texas.",
      "In Congress, Democrats have called for a precise inventory of operations\u2019 power use and resulting emissions. Republicans have largely supported the industry, including by introducing a congressional resolution last month affirming its importance to the country\u2019s energy goals and economy.",

      " that would restrict tax breaks for miners and place strict limits on their participation in programs like the Responsive Reserve.",
      "In Rockdale, where two of the largest mines in the country operate just outside the city limits, the city manager, Barbara Holly, told The Times that the town used to be \u201ca fairly wealthy little community.\u201d She said that changed when a large industrial plant that had provided thousands of jobs closed more than a decade ago. \u201cIt just cut the legs out from under this community,\u201d she said.",

Operations can grow and shrink often; The Times\u2019s analysis reflects information available as of March 9. Companies confirmed the operating levels of 21 mines, declined to confirm specific numbers for five others and did not respond to repeated requests regarding the remaining eight. WattTime\u2019s calculations were based on each mine operating 95 percent of the time \u2014 a commonly accepted industry figure \u2014 except in the case of two companies that provided alternate numbers: Coinmint and TeraWulf. WattTime\u2019s calculations also assumed miners\u2019 offline hours were during the highest-polluting times.",

      "To calculate the number of households that collectively consume as much electricity as certain mines, The Times used 2020 census data on occupied housing units from the University of Minnesota\u2019s IPUMS NHGIS system and 2021 average national and state-level household electricity consumption rates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As he strode into a bar packed with margarita-sipping young Republicans here the other night, Representative George Santos of New York looked like a man who had finally gotten what he had always wanted.",
      "Nevermind the conspicuous giggling or an introducer\u2019s reference to \u201cbipartisan condemnation\u201d that he has inspired. It was a glorious spring night in the capital, and for eight minutes, Mr. Santos had something rare: an invitation to speak.",
      "Standing behind a high-top, he roasted Don Lemon, the former CNN anchor ",
      ", and offered advice about running for office. \u201cI didn\u2019t wait my turn,\u201d he said, adding an expletive. He added that Covid made people pick \u201cstupid presidents,\u201d and declared, with no apparent sense of irony, that \u201cthe truth will set you free.\u201d",

Mr. Santos seems eager to test whether he can make the journey from laughingstock to legitimacy by aligning himself with former President Donald J. Trump \u2014 or at least signaling that he\u2019s in on the joke.",
      "In just the last few weeks, he showed up outside the Manhattan courthouse where Mr. Trump was being arraigned, making himself, in a pair of oversized dark sunglasses, a brief sideshow for a mob of reporters. He\u2019s laughed gamely as a Trump impressionist ",
      " pretended to choose him, George Santos, as his vice-presidential running mate.",
      "And on Wednesday, he forced his colleagues to watch and listen as he withheld his support for a major Republican debt limit bill, finally committing his vote just after the clock ran out.",
      "If it is an unorthodox, and perhaps still futile path, Mr. Santos has few other options. He ",
      ". His local Republican Party has banned him from its events, and pushed other civic organizations to blackball him, too. The invitation by the Washington, D.C., Young Republicans was his first time on the capital speaking circuit.",
      "Mr. Santos insists this is all a good thing, leaving him more time to speak directly to constituents who ",
      " next year, to introduce bills \u2014 11 to date \u2014 and to draw attention to them in speeches on the House floor. But in an institution that requires cooperation to get anything done, he is stuck in a vacuum.",
      "Representative Jerrold Nadler, the dean of New York\u2019s congressional delegation, has barred him from regular, bipartisan meetings to discuss the state\u2019s priorities. Representatives for New York\u2019s senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, said he has yet to seek to work with them. And while House leaders navigating a razor-thin majority have stopped short of calling for his expulsion, colleagues say they have made clear they will only tolerate so much.",
      "\u201cI have no doubt that he will be a one-term congressman,\u201d said Representative Anthony D\u2019Esposito, a fellow New York Republican who, like Mr. Santos, flipped a Democratic-leaning suburban district on Long Island last November.",
      "Mr. D\u2019Esposito said he had gone out of his way to make sure his name did not appear on letters or bills with Mr. Santos, and bemoaned the constant churn that seemed to follow his colleague, and overshadow his own work.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s looking for life after this short stint on Capitol Hill,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Esposito said.",
      "Risa Heller, a Democrat and public relations guru who advises big-name clients in unsavory situations, said it was not impossible for Mr. Santos to entertain thoughts of re-election.",
      "\u201cWe live in a world where literally a reality TV star became president of the United States\u201d she said. But\u00a0then again, a future on reality TV may be more realistic, she added.",
      "\u201cCould he get a job on \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019? Probably. \u2018Survivor\u2019? \u2018Big Brother 2024\u2019? That all seems like a plausible option,\u201d she said.",
      "For now, Mr. Santos at least puts on the appearance of enjoying life on Capitol Hill.",
      "\u201cI came here to represent the people, and I don\u2019t dislike it. I genuinely don\u2019t,\u201d he said in an impromptu interview before stepping into an elevator outside his office.",
      "He was hoping to plunge down into the Capitol\u2019s subterranean tunnels, but instead the elevator shot up, giving him time for several minutes of banter. He lamented being trapped with a reporter (\u201cthat, I guarantee you, I don\u2019t want to do\u201d), cast a look at a woman speaking loudly into a cellphone, and when a fellow passenger complimented his pink silk tie, he tried a joke. It\u00a0did not land.",
      "\u201cLook, it\u2019s going to sound silly. It\u2019s pop culture. It\u2019s really bad,\u201d the congressman started to explain. \u201cRemember \u2018Mean Girls,\u2019 the movie? They would make the joke, \u2018on Wednesdays, we wear pink.\u2019\u201d",
      "Finally in the basement, Mr. Santos said reverently that he never talked about politics in the Capitol. He then proceeded to answer some questions about politics.",
      "No, he said, he was not concerned about the vow by Nassau County Republicans, who backed his 2020 and 2022 campaigns, to defeat him. Nor did he need to reintroduce himself to voters, though he quickly thought better of an offer to tour the district with a reporter. And rumors aside, he said he had never considered quitting.",
      "\u201cI live in the district. I\u2019m a constituent of the district. I know the people. I eat in the district. I shop in the district. Folks know me. They call me,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe reality is, trying to paint me as a boogeyman isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d",
      "Local Republicans dispute that he is a meaningful presence, outside of the occasional tour of a Coast Guard facility or veterans hospital. This week, Mr. Santos\u2019s ",
      " showed no upcoming events.",
      "\u201cA ghost!\u201d Bruce Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, wrote in a text.",
      "At the one event he did show up to in Washington this week, the dozens of Hill aides and America First-aligned young professionals who turned out seemed torn over whether Mr. Santos could be repackaged as a principled conservative or was doomed to remain a political circus act.",
      "\u201cTraditionally, Republicans when they get caught doing something with their pants down, they have to apologize and resign, so that brazenness of saying \u2018I\u2019m going to stick it out, I\u2019m going to fight,\u2019 I think we respect that mentality,\u201d said Kingsley Cortes, a former Trump campaign aide, adding that she was impressed by Mr. Santos\u2019s conservative voting record.",
      "But then again, Ms. Cortes, who helped lead a \u201cMAGA takeover\u201d of the club earlier this year, acknowledged that the invitation to the congressman\u00a0would also\u00a0goose attendance.",
      "\u201cWe want to be a place that creates buzz and draws people in,\u201d she added. \u201cSeeing someone like George Santos is exciting for a lot of people. You see skits about him on S.N.L. He\u2019s talked about constantly.\u201d",
      "At times in his eight-minute speech, Mr. Santos seemed just as torn \u2014 and perhaps even contrite.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m faulty, I\u2019ve made mistakes. All of you have made mistakes,\u201d he said, skipping over details of his own. \u201cThe truth will set you free. True statement \u2014 very, very true statement.\u201d",
      "Later, as he was skewering Mr. Lemon as a liar, Mr. Santos again turned the lens on himself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so easy to point fingers, so easy to be a jackass in life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, when it happens to you, you expect, you know, people to be sincere.\u201d",
      "He paused to rib another journalist in the room, then added: \u201cThe reality is you just have to take this life and live it.\u201d"

      "The nightmare shook the old man, who was now in his late 90s. He dreamed of falling from the sky. He awoke feeling helpless and afraid.",
      "John Wenzel, a veteran, automotive executive, father and grandfather, had recently moved into a senior living apartment in Brooklyn Heights, the Watermark on Clark Street, a new, frills-and-all building with a Manhattan skyline view. He would soon turn 99 and become the oldest resident there. Since his wife, Alice, died more than 10 years earlier, he had settled into a quiet rhythm, alone with his jazz records and his painting.",
      "And suddenly, out of nowhere, these nightmares. He feared he had suffered a seizure, but his vital signs were normal. His adult daughters, Emily and Abby, were also worried. Their father had always been so steady and predictable and was never prone to this sort of profound disquiet.",
      "Looking for its source would send Mr. Wenzel and his daughters on a journey back more than 70 years, to a time and a place he had worked purposely his entire adult life to leave behind, to World War II and the skies above Italy.",
      "Emily and Abby were young girls when they learned their father had fought in the war. They remember a day the family visited their grandmother\u2019s house and she proudly pulled four slender boxes from a drawer. Inside were several medals on bright ribbons.",
      "\u201cShe wanted us to take them home,\u201d Abby Wenzel, now 63, recently recalled. The girls were intensely curious \u2014 the medals were so beautiful \u2014 but their father\u2019s response was immediate: \u201cHe said, \u2018I got those in the war, and I don\u2019t want them.\u2019\u201d",
      "And so the medals stayed out of sight, where he preferred them, for decades.",
      "There are fewer and fewer soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen who lived through World War II. Close to 16 million Americans served in the war; ",
      ". Like Mr. Wenzel, many of these veterans put the war behind them. Much has been written about \u201cthe Greatest Generation\u201d and its valor abroad, as well as its humility back home. This narrative masked the individuals and the personal tolls they would pay.",
      "Over the years, the girls came to understand that their father had been a fighter pilot and that he had been wounded \u2014 in his rear end. This never failed to make them laugh. Did he need special pants? A special chair? And he would grin and endure their gentle teasing. He was a warm and funny man, but that grin was about all anyone got out of him on that subject.",
      "The family lived in Sea Cliff, on Long Island. Mr. Wenzel had worked at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City before joining Ideal Corporation, which manufactured stainless steel hose clamps for automobiles and aircraft in East New York. He worked his way up and eventually became president of the company.",
      "He retired and played a lot of golf until his aging body caught up with him. Finally, in 2023, living in Brooklyn and stooped and slowed by a broken hip, his 100th birthday approaching, he was suddenly overwhelmed by the stress he survived as a younger man.",
      "The nightmares sent his daughters back to those little rectangular boxes they had first seen at their grandmother\u2019s. They brought them to their father, along with some typed notes he\u2019d written at some point, as he began to finally speak about his time in the war.",
      "The writings begin abruptly. On Dec. 7, 1941, breaking news interrupted a game of bridge at Lafayette College, a liberal arts school in Pennsylvania. \u201cTrain came down from N.Y. with many guys like me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI joined them.\u201d",
      "The attack on Pearl Harbor pulled the United States and millions of its young men into uniform. John Wenzel was 19 when he enlisted and was dispatched to flight school in Miami. He had never even been on an airplane, but he emerged in 1944 as a fighter pilot and was sent off to the Italian front to fight the Nazis. He would fly the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bomber, the lone occupant of an eight-ton weapon when fully loaded.",
      "\u201cI never got good at marching or saluting,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut they made me a pretty good pilot.\u201d",
      "Lieutenant Wenzel flew scattered missions in Northern Italy, near Milan, and just over the Austrian border in early 1945. His bombs destroyed Axis railroad cars and a large gasoline truck outside a depot in Trento. In February, he bombed and strafed more than a dozen enemy cars with machine guns in Lienz, Austria. He severed a rail line and fired rockets at stalled enemy train cars in Novara in March.",
      "But it was all just a lead-up to April 1945.",
      "Fighting was furious then on the Italian ground, with the Allies depending on the roaring Thunderbolts overhead near Verona and along the Po River south of Milan.",
      "Lieutenant Wenzel was flying several attack missions every week, guiding his team through bad weather and, in Air Force parlance, \u201cpersistent and accurate antiaircraft fire.\u201d \u201cThe irony,\u201d he wrote later in his notes, \u201cis that we were working harder than ever, flying some of our best missions, but for the first time we talked openly about survival.\u201d",
      "He eluded enemy fire for the first 13 days of April.",
      "On April 14, Lieutenant Wenzel led a team of four fighter planes, providing air support for units pushing toward a rail hub in the town of Zocca. Lieutenant Wenzel scored a direct hit with his bombs, destroying enemy guns.",
      "Then a German shell burst right outside his cockpit. Fragments sliced into his plane, tearing his uniform. Bleeding from his neck, he circled around for another attack before guiding his heavily damaged aircraft back to the base.",
      "His actions that day would earn him a Purple Heart, but first, Lieutenant Wenzel returned to the air.",
      "\u201cGerman troops were on both sides of the river and were beating our guys up with all kinds of guns,\u201d Lieutenant Wenzel wrote later. His team flew toward a farmhouse that held a machine-gun nest.",
      "\u201cOn our first pass, there were plenty of tracers coming at us, and I got hit from underneath,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt felt like somebody had paddled my rear end.\u201d",
      "He asked another pilot to fly under his plane to eyeball the damage. Looks OK, the pilot reported, even as smoke started to fill Lieutenant Wenzel\u2019s cockpit and his parachute seemed to be on fire. He radioed his fellow pilots to coordinate another pass on the farmhouse.",
      "An officer got on the radio: \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be a jerk, John. Go home.\u2019\u201d The officer, Joseph Dickerson, was a captain and outranked the lieutenant. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have a military discipline handbook with me,\u201d Mr. Wenzel wrote. \u201cWe told him we were having too much fun to go home.\u201d",
      "The team attacked their target again until, satisfied, they turned toward Pisa and their air base. But Lieutenant Wenzel\u2019s troubles were mounting.",
      "\u201cI began to think that old Joe was right,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fire had consumed most of my chute, plus the seat of my pants, and was starting on my seatbelt, which burned like the wick to a cheap firecracker.\u201d",
      "He couldn\u2019t eject without a parachute, and opening the cockpit would feed the flames with oxygen. His only option was to push on to Pisa.",
      "He finally landed, and a crew hurried to extinguish the flames. A doctor \u201cpulled a few steel splinters out of me\u201d and treated him with burn ointment. He wisecracked: \u201cMy request for a replacement pair of trousers was denied.\u201d",
      "Earning a Purple Heart is usually a source of great pride, a testament to surviving an injury in combat. Earning two Purple Hearts in eight days would seem to place a man in the company of the very, very lucky.",
      "Lieutenant Wenzel shipped back home in late 1945. He graduated from Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, and ended up in New York City. He found an apartment on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village. But for a buddy or two from the service, he was alone.",
      "He liked to paint in a studio he rented for $20 a month on the Lower East Side. After a day of painting, he would walk toward home, but not quite get there. The first stop instead was the San Remo Cafe, also on Macdougal.",
      "The place, like the surrounding city, would have been thick with unmoored young veterans like himself, and Mr. Wenzel found comfort in their company \u2014 \u201cpeople like me,\u201d he\u2019d say later \u2014 without exactly interacting with them. He drank a lot, and he kept to himself.",
      "He would go on to call this \u201cthe dark times,\u201d and once told a grandnephew that he was \u201ca mess\u201d then.",
      "Eventually, he discovered his instinct for business. He met a young social worker, Alice Newman, and they married and started a family. He stayed busy, and the war faded into the background.",
      "And, for more than 70 years, that was where the war stayed. The nightmares arrived when he moved into his Brooklyn apartment \u2014 so vivid he believed they were real and scolded his home nurse for not saving him. Doctors could find no physical cause for the panic. A sleep specialist suggested he speak to a therapist.",
      "His daughters set him up with a counselor over Zoom, who suggested he consider opening up more about his past. And the stories slowly revealed themselves. The Wenzel daughters found their father, far out of character, eager to share.",
      "In early March, shortly before his 100th birthday, Mr. Wenzel agreed to an interview, conducted in his living room. Beside him were his medals, the first time he\u2019d seen them in decades \u2014 a Distinguished Flying Cross, an Air Medal, a Silver Star, his two Purple Hearts. His vision and hearing diminished, he spoke with effort about staying quiet for so long.",
      "\u201cThere was no place to talk about it, and no way to express myself,\u201d he said. He glanced toward the medals. \u201cFor many years, these were tucked away. We didn\u2019t have much reason to pull them out.\u201d",
      "He said that right after the war, even in a downtown bar filled with other soldiers, it was unbecoming to seem to seek attention. \u201cNobody asked me about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring it up.\u201d",
      "He became aware of reunions of his old fighter squadron. He rarely went. \u201cI didn\u2019t see why I should spend my time \u2026\u201d His voice trailed off.",
      "Years ago, his wife wanted to visit Italy and, in particular, Venice. No, thanks, he said reflexively. Not Venice.",
      "\u201cThere were certain places you weren\u2019t supposed to bomb or shoot up,\u201d he explained recently. \u201cVenice was one of them.\u201d",
      "He recalls flying over the untouchable city. \u201cGerman soldiers had occupied Venice, and were enjoying the sunshine and whatever else they got in Venice,\u201d he recalled. It angered him.",
      "Eventually, he relented and visited the city with Alice. \u201cShe liked Venice,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He chuckled. He said he hoped stories like his would keep the war from being forgotten.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid people are going to take it lightly \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got their own wars, and World War II is getting to be smaller and smaller.\u201d",
      "The bravado he had once shown in his writing \u2014 \u201ctoo much fun to go home\u201d \u2014 long ago fled him. The medals, for years hidden away, have filled that space. \u201cI found I needed to look at them,\u201d Mr. Wenzel said. The nightmares have stopped.",

      "But the impact of mass shootings is felt long after they fade from the headlines and is borne by an alarming number of Americans. A recent ",
      ", a public-health research group, found that more than half of adults said they or a relative had been affected by a gun-related incident, including being threatened or witnessing a shooting.",
      "The experiences of victims in the Brooklyn attack illustrate the long-term consequences: the damage not just to bodies, but also to a sense of safety and the ability to earn a living.",
      "Rudy Perez, 21, had arrived from Guatemala only about nine months before the attack. He had once hoped to go to college, but going abroad held more economic promise. His family paid about $17,000 to a smuggler who helped him cross the Texas border.",
      "He arrived on a Thursday and started working that Monday, at first laying tiles and then assisting an electrician. The morning of the attack, he was headed to a renovation job near Columbus Circle, where he would make about $140 for the day. But his ability to support himself and his family, and to repay that debt, would be severely compromised that morning.",
      "At the New Utrecht stop, he immediately noticed the attacker, Frank James, who appeared to have luggage with him, but he didn\u2019t think anything was amiss. Three stops later, the train had filled with riders. Smoke came from under a seat, everything turned gray and the shooting began.",
      "\u201cI started to panic,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the sound in my mind.\u201d",
      "The train paused before it pulled into 36th Street. Only then did Mr. Perez realize he was bleeding from his skinny calf. A bullet had hit the muscle, missing the bone. He was taken to N.Y.U. Langone Hospital in Brooklyn, where doctors extracted the bullet. Dr. Jonathan Cardwell, who treated him, recalled that he was pale and quiet, in a state of shock.",
      "In the months after, he languished. He couldn\u2019t walk and was left with no income. He called offices and lawyers in vain, often unable to communicate. He said that the state Office of Victim Services asked for a Social Security number, which he did not have, and he never received any compensation.",
      "He survived on rice, cereal and other basics delivered by a nonprofit, the Center for Family Life. A younger stepsister, who arrived after him and was working as a live-in maid, gave him money for rent.",
      "By the summer, he had started working here and there \u2014 and venturing out, trying the roller coasters in Coney Island with friends and even the Sunset Park public pool, though he was hesitant to put his leg in.",
      "N.Y.U. Langone and the center helped set up therapy sessions where he learned breathing exercises to control anxiety. He did sessions during his lunch breaks.",
      "The bullet had missed the bone, and he expects to make a full recovery. A lawyer is helping him file for a special visa for crime victims. He is now working whenever a job is available and thinks he\u2019ll be able to pay off his smuggling debt soon.",
      "One simple thing worried him: running. But he was late for his train on a recent morning and found himself sprinting.",
      "\u201cFrom there, I felt I could, and I was happy,\u201d he said.",
      "Aroldo Gonzalez\u2019s recovery has been rougher. The 19-year-old American-born son of Guatemalan immigrants was headed to Borough of Manhattan Community College, where he was working toward becoming a police officer.",
      "During the attack, a bullet had entered his calf and lodged under his knee. He thinks his favorite footwear, Doc Martens platform boots that make him an inch or so taller, saved his joint. He also had a surface wound on his torso.",
      "Doctors at Maimonides Medical Center left the bullet in his leg. But shortly after he returned home, the wound opened again and started gushing blood. He blacked out and received three transfusions at N.Y.U. Langone before surgery to extract the slug. The torso wound became infected and had to be operated on.",
      "Doctors said a full recovery would take three years.",
      "\u201cI hated the feeling of not being able to walk and having everyone do everything for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPrior to that, I didn\u2019t like asking for help. Now I was forced into taking it.\u201d",
      "His injuries impede his progress. He stayed in school, completing his work remotely, but with a reduced course load that delayed his graduation by a semester.",
      "He was frustrated that he couldn\u2019t help more over the Easter weekend as he, his mother, Olga Guinea, and his siblings moved into a new apartment. They had spent months searching for a place because he couldn\u2019t make it up and down the stairs in their previous walk-up. He still cannot walk too far and struggles with taking the train.",
      "The first time he did so, with his girlfriend, he panicked. They tried to walk the rest of the way, but ended up calling an Uber to go just a few blocks.",
      "\u201cI kind of still feel like a burden,\u201d he said.",

      "A top political adviser to Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York abruptly informed colleagues that he would resign on Sunday, citing ",
      " that called into question his political counsel and described a toxic work environment under him.",
      "The adviser, Adam C. Sullivan, was not a state government employee but had been the de facto head of Ms. Hochul\u2019s political operation, as well as a trusted and well-compensated confidant for more than a decade. He oversaw\u00a0her 2022 campaign\u00a0from his home in Colorado, and she had\u00a0deputized him to help steer the\u00a0beleaguered state Democratic Party.",
      "In an email Sunday to colleagues, including the state party chairman, Mr. Sullivan apologized for behavior that included belittling and marginalizing his subordinates\u00a0and said he and the governor\u00a0agreed he should relinquish his responsibilities\u00a0\u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn retrospect, I can see the toll that the campaign took on me,\u201d he wrote in the email, sent just after 5 p.m. \u201cAnd after some serious thinking, I think it best if I take some time away from politics and the campaign environment and get healthy.\u201d",
      "Ms. Hochul, a Democrat\u00a0who had praised Mr. Sullivan just last week, confirmed his resignation in a separate brief statement. She did not elaborate on who might fill his place, and Mr. Sullivan did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.",
      "\u201cI was disappointed by what was described in The New York Times story about Adam, and he and I agreed that he should step back,\u201d Ms. Hochul\u00a0said.",
      "The departure comes at a politically fraught time for the governor, as she is putting ",
      " that is a month overdue. Questions about Mr. Sullivan\u2019s political acumen and treatment of other Hochul aides had become a distraction in Albany in recent days, with labor leaders, ",
      " and lobbyists questioning how Ms. Hochul could continue relying on him.",
      "Some fellow Democrats said on Sunday said that Ms. Hochul had made the right decision.",
      "\u201cGiven that nobody knew what Mr. Sullivan was responsible for, perhaps his departure will add clarity to her organizational chart,\u201d said Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Democratic state senator from Manhattan. \u201cGovernor Hochul has a strong team on the second floor. This will improve the lines of communication between the governor and the Legislature.\u201d",
      "A friend and adviser to Ms. Hochul\u00a0since her 2011 special election to Congress, Mr. Sullivan, 42, amassed considerable influence after she unexpectedly became governor in August 2021. He helped build her administration, oversaw her widely criticized campaign for a full term and recently\u00a0took a more active role with the state party.",
      "During the campaign, he pushed back against other advisers\u00a0who wanted to see Ms. Hochul more actively address fears about crime \u2014 a potent line of attack used by Republicans.",
      "Mr. Sullivan argued that crime was a losing issue for a Democratic governor, and advised Ms. Hochul to stay focused on abortion rights, an issue he believed would motivate voters. Ms. Hochul narrowly won, but national Democrats have blamed her approach for costing House seats in New York.",
      "Ms. Hochul does have other important advisers who have played a role in building her political team, including Karen Persichilli Keogh, her top government aide, and Jefrey Pollock, her longtime pollster. But none played quite the role Mr. Sullivan did.",
      "Without a defined job title and no social media profile, Mr. Sullivan operated largely out of public view from his home 1,700 miles away in\u00a0Leadville, Colo.\u00a0He had few relationships with important political actors in the state and even his generous compensation was murky.",
      "Ms. Hochul\u2019s campaign reported paying $50,000 since 2021 to a limited liability company that Mr. Sullivan controls, \u201cACS Campaign Consulting.\u201d But The Times found that he had earned $500,000 or more in a secretive arrangement where he received a portion of what the campaign spent on TV ads.",
      "Mr. Sullivan also faced dissent from within Ms. Hochul\u2019s campaign team and the executive chamber. The Times\u2019s report cited more than 15 colleagues who said that Mr. Sullivan had disparaged subordinates, especially young women, froze out aides who disagreed with him and often shifted blame to others when the campaign faltered.",
      "The aides and advisers who spoke to The Times all requested anonymity for fear of retribution, but said they believed Mr. Sullivan was pulling down Ms. Hochul\u2019s political standing.",
      "In his email on Sunday, Mr. Sullivan apologized \u201cto anyone who felt harmed in any way by my behavior.\u201d",
      "He also suggested the break would be permanent.",
      "Ms. Hochul would govern \u201cwithout me interfering in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to watching her success from afar.\u201d"

      ", joking\u00a0to a crowd about his changing nicknames for Hillary Clinton and President Biden. He did not mention Ms. Carroll\u2019s testimony, or the civil trial going on 250 miles away. But he remarked cheerfully on a poll released that day, which showed him far and away leading the 2024 Republican primary field.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was ",
      ", his legal travails and his third presidential campaign have played out on ",
      " The courtroom dramas have taken place without news cameras present, even as the race has returned Mr. Trump to the spotlight that briefly dimmed after he left the Oval Office.",
      "Ms. Carroll\u2019s harrowing testimony, a visceral demonstration of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal peril, has emphasized\u00a0the\u00a0surreal nature of the divide. Mr. Trump is the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. But he has also been indicted on 34 felony false records charges, and in Ms. Carroll\u2019s case faces a nine-person jury that will determine whether he committed rape decades ago. And then there are the other investigations: for election interference, mishandling sensitive documents and his role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\u201cTo see a former and potential future president of the United States confront all these legal issues at once is bizarre,\u201d said Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party and a vocal opponent of Mr. Trump. \u201cBut what\u2019s really disturbing about it is that he\u2019s the front-runner for a major political party in this country. And you can\u2019t just blame that on him. You have to blame that on the leaders of the party and their primary base.\u201d",
      "The past week brought the former president a steady stream of setbacks. Ms. Carroll gave detailed and graphic testimony about the encounter with Mr. Trump. The judge in the case sought to limit Mr. Trump\u2019s posts on social media, as did the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office in its own case. And former Vice President Mike Pence ",

Mr. Trump\u2019s legal problems have yet to create significant political problems given the unflinching loyalty of his core supporters.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was indicted, his poll numbers have risen. Criminal investigations against him, in Georgia and Washington, as well as Ms. Carroll\u2019s trial and a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general\u2019s office, have done little to hamper him with his supporters.

      "But the investigations could cause Mr. Trump real harm. If he is convicted in Manhattan, where he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, he could face up to four years in prison. Criminal charges in Georgia and Washington could come with steeper punishments. And the New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit against him \u2014 which accused him of deceiving lenders and insurers by fraudulently overvaluing his assets \u2014 could exact a heavy financial toll.",
      "No matter the outcome, any direct connection between Mr. Trump\u2019s legal fate in the rape case and his political fortunes is tenuous. But Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers have reshaped a political bombshell from 2016 into a potent legal weapon: They plan to use ",

      "The assault, she said, took place in a sixth-floor dressing room. After Mr. Trump shut the door, she said, he shoved her against the wall hard enough\u00a0that she hit her head. He put his mouth against hers, Ms. Carroll said, pulled down her tights, put his fingers inside of her vagina and then his penis. ",
      "Ms. Carroll testified that she has been unable to have sex or a romantic relationship since.",
      "\u201cI am a happy person basically, but I\u2019m aware that I have lost out on one of the glorious experiences of any human being,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing in love with somebody else, making dinner with them, walking the dog together. I don\u2019t have that.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Joseph Tacopina, began cross-examining Ms. Carroll. He sought to highlight her memory lapses \u2014 most prominently her inability to provide the date of the alleged rape \u2014 and to elicit testimony that he suggested showed the jury how implausible the story seemed. He noted that Ms. Carroll herself had written in her 2019 memoir, where she first told her story, that some of the details were \u201codd\u201d and \u201cinconceivable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt all comes down to: Do you believe the unbelievable?\u201d Mr. Tacopina said during his opening statement.",
      "The jurors, six men and three women, will decide whether Ms. Carroll proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Trump committed the assault. Because the trial is civil, he would face monetary damages rather than a conviction.",
      "Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawsuit also seeks a retraction of what the suit says were defamatory comments on his Truth Social website last October, when he called her case \u201ca complete con job\u201d and \u201ca Hoax and a lie.\u201d",
      "The social platform is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most potent political tools. And the legal cases are threatening his ability to use it unhindered.",
      "On Tuesday, a prosecutor working for the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, ",
      " in the false business records criminal case to limit Mr. Trump from disseminating evidence online, including on that platform.",
      "And on Wednesday, after the former president made Truth Social posts calling Ms. Carroll\u2019s allegation a \u201cmade up SCAM\u201d and a \u201cfraudulent & false story,\u201d the federal judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, said they were \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d and suggested the former president was attempting to influence the jury.",
      "When, hours later, Judge Kaplan was told by Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyer that Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric had tweeted an attack on Ms. Carroll\u2019s case, the judge sternly suggested the former president might face criminal sanction.",

      "Last April, Jack Reid, a 17-year-old junior at one of the nation\u2019s elite boarding schools, tucked a Bible into his gym shorts and a note into his pocket directing his parents to a Google document explaining his feelings of despair. Then, inside his dorm room, he took his own life.",
      "On Sunday, the anniversary of Jack\u2019s death, the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey offered an extraordinary admission of failure, publicly acknowledging that it had been aware that Jack was being bullied by other students, but that it had fallen \u201ctragically short\u201d of its obligation to protect him.",
      "\u201cThe school acknowledges that bullying and unkind behavior, and actions taken or not taken by the school, likely contributed to Jack\u2019s death,\u201d Lawrenceville officials wrote in a ",
      " on the school\u2019s website.",
      "The school committed to taking a series of corrective actions including endowing a new dean\u2019s position that will be focused on mental health issues, with a goal of becoming a model for anti-bullying and student mental health.",
      "The statement was part of a negotiated settlement with Jack\u2019s parents, Elizabeth and Bill Reid.",
      "It offered a candid and detailed catalog of the school\u2019s missteps before Jack\u2019s death and a window into the culture of a private institution where room and board tops $76,000 a year. It also represents shifting attitudes surrounding the ",
      " and the ",
      " in an always complex set of factors that can contribute to suicide.",
      "\u201cWe feel like we both have life sentences without the possibility of parole,\u201d Dr. Reid, a clinical psychologist, said in an interview in which her husband also participated. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019d love to change here is to get Jack back. I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI do know if he were alive, he would want me \u2014 both of us \u2014 to try to make something good out of this and honor him in the way he lived his life.\u201d",
      "Richard Lieberman, the lead suicide prevention expert for the public school system in Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second-largest system, called Lawrenceville\u2019s response rare \u2014 and courageous. He said he had never before heard of a school\u2019s accepting responsibility so publicly after a suicide.",
      "\u201cWe need to talk more about this. We really do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a leading cause of death of our youth.\u201d",
      "Jack was bullied over the course of a year, the school said in the statement posted on Sunday.",
      "After his suicide, the school\u2019s board of trustees retained the law firm Petrillo Klein & Boxer to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death. The investigation included interviews with 45 students, faculty members and others, according to a detailed report on its findings, which the school provided to The New York Times.",
      "The firm also reviewed emails from more than 100 students and school personnel, as well as Jack\u2019s personal emails, phone records, text messages and internet searches, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe said from the beginning, \u2018Let\u2019s seek the truth and follow it where it leads us. Period,\u2019 \u201d Stephen S. Murray, Lawrenceville\u2019s head of school, said on Sunday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to do every step of the way.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis happened on my watch and I\u2019m grief stricken. And yet I can\u2019t begin to compare that to the grief and sorrow of Bill and Elizabeth Reid.\u201d",
      "Lawrenceville\u2019s statement said that its settlement with the Reids was aimed at \u201chonoring Jack, taking appropriate responsibility and instituting meaningful changes that will support the school\u2019s aspirations of becoming a model for anti-bullying and student mental health.\u201d",
      "The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated an already worrying mental ",
      " among teenagers, made worse by a severe shortage of therapists and treatment options and insufficient research to explain the trend. Nearly three in five girls ",
      " in 2021. Suicide rates also ticked up that year after a ",
      ", particularly in groups most affected by the pandemic, according to a ",
      " released in February by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Christine Yu Moutier, chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said the ",
      " were always complex and were never tied to only one stressor.",
      "\u201cBullying absolutely can be an important factor that can be part of the multi-factor convergence of things that culminates in suicide,\u201d Dr. Moutier said in an interview, speaking generally and not about Jack Reid\u2019s death or any other specific incident. \u201cBut it is not thought, in any case of suicide, to be the sole cause.\u201d",
      "The law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink, which represented the Reids, declined to comment on the settlement or whether it included a payment by the school to the family.",
      "Lawrenceville enrolls about 830 students on a spacious campus in western New Jersey, between Trenton and Princeton. It is considered by the school-ranking website Niche to be among the nation\u2019s ",
      ". Before enrolling in Lawrenceville as a sophomore, Jack attended the Buckley School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he was recalled as a leader who consistently stood out for his kindness. Roughly 900 people attended a funeral service, Jack\u2019s parents said, and 1,500 more watched it online.",
      "Jack\u2019s early days at Lawrenceville, where he arrived as a 10th grader in the fall of 2020, were happy ones, his parents said. He made friends and the dean\u2019s list.",
      "But in the spring of 2021, a persistent and untrue rumor that Jack was a rapist spread widely throughout the student body and led to cruel comments from some students, according to his parents.",
      "In September 2021, when he returned to school as a junior, he was nonetheless elected president of Dickinson House, one of the residential houses where the school\u2019s boarding students live. That appears to have increased animosity among some of his classmates and caused the rumor to spread further, his parents said.",
      "A few days after the election, the unfounded rape accusation was posted anonymously to a nationwide, student-run app popular with boarding-school students, Jack\u2019s parents said.",
      "The bullying spread quickly online, his parents said, and at Christmastime, during a secret Santa gift exchange among Lawrenceville classmates, Jack received a rape whistle and a book about how to make friends.",
      "Mr. Reid recalled that his son was hurt deeply, and that when Jack came home for Christmas he seemed withdrawn. \u201cDad, will this ever go away?\u201d he said his son asked him, \u201cWill it ever get off the website?\u201d",
      "Mr. Reid noted that the in-person bullying at school combined with the power of the internet posting compounded the rumor\u2019s impact.",
      "\u201cWe think bullying, with the 1,000 times echo chamber of the internet and everybody knowing, is much more devastating to kids and, in Jack\u2019s case, produced a very impulsive act,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had to escape the pain from the humiliation he was feeling.\u201d",
      "Early on, with support from his parents, Jack approached school officials and asked them to intervene, leading to a school-led investigation surrounding the bullying and the sexual assault allegation.",
      "The school inquiry found that the claim was bogus, and a classmate involved in spreading the rumors, who was later expelled for an unrelated violation of school rules, was formally disciplined for bullying Jack, according to the school\u2019s statement.",
      "But Lawrenceville never told Jack or his family \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 that the investigation had concluded that the rumors involving a sexual assault were utterly false.",
      "\u201cThere were steps that the school should in hindsight have taken but did not, including the fact that the school did not make a public or private statement that it investigated and found rumors about Jack that were untrue,\u201d Lawrenceville said in the statement.",
      "The school and the Reids also tried unsuccessfully to get comments related to the sexual assault claims removed from the app.",
      "The school also acknowledged that it had erred more specifically on the night Jack took his life, just hours after the classmate involved in the bullying was formally expelled. Instead of being supervised as he packed his belongings, the boy was permitted to participate in a drawn-out farewell that included a final run around campus and a group photograph. During the gathering, some students also made harsh comments about Jack, inaccurately blaming him for the boy\u2019s expulsion.",
      "\u201cSchool administrators did not notify or check on Jack,\u201d the school\u2019s statement acknowledged. \u201cThat night, Jack took his life, telling a friend that he could not go through this again.\u201d",
      "Dr. Reid said that Jack had been seeing a therapist at the time of his death because of the bullying, but that he had never discussed killing himself. Jack also displayed none of the underlying factors that might have indicated he was at risk for suicide, she said.",
      "The school said that it would contribute to a foundation the Reid family has established that will focus on education and prevention of bullying, and that it would make a recurring gift to a mental health organization to support research and best practices for suicide prevention in school environments.",
      "Public schools in most states are governed by laws that regulate the investigation and response to behavior considered bullying and require instruction aimed at limiting its spread.But private, parochial and boarding schools have far more autonomy in deciding how to address bullying.",
      "Mr. Reid said that the family also hoped to lobby for legislation in New York and New Jersey in an effort to broaden laws tied to bullying at private schools.",
      "Lawrenceville said in its statement that it would contract with a specialist to draft policies to identify and address behaviors that lead to school bullying and cyberbullying.",
      "\u201cWe acknowledge,\u201d the school said, \u201cthat more should have been done to protect Jack.\u201d"

The building was home to a women-only bar. An artist who might also have been a spy lived upstairs for decades. The penthouse once housed a pipe organ and a stuffed buffalo head.

      "Walking by 80 West 40th Street, you might notice the spectacular double-height windows. But it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine what is happening, and all that has happened, inside.",
      "The building opened in 1901. Its construction was funded by Col. Abraham Archibald Anderson, who commissioned the architect Charles A. Rich to design a 10-story structure with tall, north-facing windows that would contain space only for artists. Originally called Beaux Arts Studios, it was the first high-rise building of artist studios in New York City. Colonel Anderson, who had studied art in Paris and then ",

      "As someone with a (perfect, adorable) dog, I know how unhinged I must sound when talking to him. I make sounds I did not know existed within me, but I can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s just very cute and very good. Fortunately, I work from home mostly, so I don\u2019t have to subject anyone to this excessive display of adoration.",
      "Bringing dogs into the workplace only works if the dogs are well behaved and well managed by their humans. One or two or more people bringing their dogs to work shouldn\u2019t mean they become everyone\u2019s problem, because not everyone loves dogs! And even if you do love dogs, you don\u2019t necessarily love having your workday interrupted by baby-talking humans or a dog (obviously a good boy) that barks too much and roams the office to share its vocal enthusiasm.",
      "There should be clear, reasonable guidelines for bringing pets to work, if it is allowed. These guidelines should respect everyone\u2019s needs and also set the dogs up for success in a professional workplace. Is there a way to broach developing such guidelines with your manager? I\u2019m afraid the baby talking is an incurable condition, but can you speak with your colleagues about managing their dogs\u2019 barking? I firmly believe there\u2019s a solution here that will improve the situation. It just takes a little patience, a little kindness and having an honest but well-intended conversation or two.",
      "I can\u2019t really imagine what kind of power play this man would be making by offering blessings or benedictions, which are not, strictly, religious terms. A benediction is an offering of good wishes, though it can also be a prayer offered in, well, blessing. And he could be offering blessings in the Southern tradition that connotes quite the opposite, like a well-timed \u201cBless your heart.\u201d",
      "Now, your colleague is probably a Christian and is either suffused with the spirit at all times or trying to spread the good word (according to his beliefs). I can see how this would be grating in a workplace because if it\u2019s not inappropriate, it\u2019s certainly adjacent. It\u2019s fine to be petty and annoyed. If his blessings and benedictions escalate into proselytizing, which is an entirely different and unacceptable thing, it\u2019s time for you to engage in some professional escalation, too.",
      "One of the more unpalatable aspects of capitalism is having to choose between equally crappy professional options. What do you value more \u2014 a great boss and working environment but intense workload or a terrible boss and a reasonable workload? Downtime is incredibly important. It\u2019s challenging to sustain great performance at work if you never have the opportunity to recharge, spend time with loved ones and pursue personal interests. At the same time, how much will you enjoy that downtime if you\u2019re constantly aggravated by a terrible boss? Have you considered a third option \u2014 a position at a different company entirely?",
      "When you\u2019re employed in an at-will state, anything can be a fireable offense so long as the firing is not discrimination based. Your employer didn\u2019t need a pretext. That said, it is quite strange to be fired over an email signature, particularly when you recently received glowing reviews and a raise. Unless the brand is poor morale, how could one person\u2019s email signature undermine the brand? Being fired for a single, minor offense that isn\u2019t particularly offensive is overkill, at best.",
      "I\u2019m not sure how company managers can possibly justify this without a pattern of behavior. If they were planning layoffs and were looking to save costs, yes, they may have done this to avoid paying you severance which is deeply unfair. I\u2019d consult an employment lawyer to see what your options may be. Something is definitely off here.",

These stories\u00a0are often straightforward, rosy accounts of a determined person who\u00a0sets out to solve a problem. But a new generation of founders are distinguishing themselves with narratives that aren\u2019t clean-cut, easily digestible stories of how their businesses came to be, experts say. They include tales of homelessness, addiction, incarceration, mental illness and physical health.",

But what happens when companies reveal some of the darkest moments of their founders\u2019 lives? Will consumers relate or be turned off by too much information?",
      "In recent years, an increasing number of small-business owners have been\u00a0divulging sensitive details about their past in company messaging, said Tulin Erdem, a professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business and the chair of the university\u2019s marketing department. Dr. Erdem said it was a \u201cpositive trend\u201d that could inspire connection with customers, as long as it was genuine and relevant to a company\u2019s product or service.",

But she said that business owners should \u201cproceed with caution\u201d when it comes to oversharing, especially about complicated topics. She said, \u201cNuance is hard to convey when someone is quickly scanning a bio, or a social media post.\u201d",

The agency found that the \u201cabout\u201d page was the second-most-visited section on a business\u2019s site, after the home page, Mr. Gaz said.

      "\u201cI felt the power by owning, completely owning, a narrative that I ran away from for so long,\u201d said Mr. Bullock, who is based in Washington, D.C. Ultimately, he hopes that being transparent can help destigmatize assumptions about formerly incarcerated people. ",

      "I turn 43 in May. In recent years, I\u2019ve taken over managing my mother\u2019s finances, which will all go to me when she passes. My father has split his assets evenly between me and my half sister. Designating their heirs was easy and conventional: Leave everything to the kids. A perpetually single, childless woman like me? Convention offers no road map.",
      "My half sister is 20 years older than me, so I effectively grew up an only child. My Iranian mother has five sisters, but they and my cousins live in Tehran. My American father isn\u2019t close with his siblings, so I rarely saw his side of the family.",
      "But I\u2019ve built meaningful friendships throughout my life, and my friends are not just my chosen family. They are \u2014 aside from my mother, 79, father, 87, and stepfather, 77 \u2014 my only family.",
      "For years, I\u2019ve envisioned leaving all of my assets to my friends. And yet, I have so many people to consider, and who wants to think about mortality anyway? Making a will that honored my love for them felt overwhelmingly complicated, especially when \u201cintestate succession\u201d laws, which govern inheritance if a person dies without a will, stop at relatives by blood, adoption or marriage. No statute considers a nonrelative.",
      "Once I started looking into how I could bequeath all my earthly belongings to my friends, things that I assumed would be logistical nightmares turned out to be simple, from notifying far-flung friends (a contact information list should suffice) to following international tax laws. (Check to see if a country taxes the estate \u2014 as the United States does \u2014 or the beneficiary and adjust your bequest accordingly.)",
      "What I didn\u2019t appreciate is how putting friends in this role can mean asking them to accept major responsibilities as executors or health care agents. As a result, what I perceived to be a one-way gift is, in some ways, more true to the reciprocity of friendship itself.",
      "Speaking of friends, I reconnected with one for this article: my college hallmate Reid Weisbord, a professor at Rutgers Law School who specializes in wealth transfer. Even though he helped write two major textbooks on estate planning, my situation is not one he has considered in depth.",
      "Mr. Weisbord said people rarely considered estate-planning challenges like mine. \u201cOur society can be really biased against people who don\u2019t have children or aren\u2019t married,\u201d he said.",
      "Some ",
      " ",
      " advise circumventing wills altogether by giving assets to friends while you\u2019re alive and of sound mind so that no one can challenge your will in court after your death. According to Mr. Weisbord, only intestate heirs \u2014 family, in other words \u2014 and anyone who was named in a prior will can do so.",
      "Unfortunately, accurate statistics on the number of contested wills are scarce. Last year, Mr. Weisbord co-wrote ",
      " that examined 443 wills probated in San Francisco from 2014 to 2016 and found that 11.5 percent went into litigation \u2014 notably higher than the estimates of 1 to 3.5 percent from studies done between 1950 and 1987. Mr. Weisbord and his co-author, David Horton, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, found that the most common reasons for litigation were wrongful influence, or taking advantage of a person\u2019s incapacity, and concerns about the suitability of the executor.",
      "One potential way to limit such challenges is to note explicitly in your will if you are omitting someone, said John G. Kelso, an estate lawyer in Asheville, N.C.",
      "While Mr. Weisbord cautioned that it was difficult to make any broad conclusions from the data, given the geographic and temporal specificity, the article does touch upon an issue that both he and Mr. Kelso said I should pay closer attention to as a single, childless person: planning for incapacity.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a partner or a spouse or a child, you really need to think very carefully about an advanced medical directive, because there may not be a person that you\u2019re comfortable appointing as a proxy directive to make those decisions on your behalf,\u201d Mr. Weisbord said.",
      "Similar care should go into whom I ask to be executor. Mr. Weisbord said to choose someone trustworthy who is willing and able to do it competently.",
      "It\u2019s not as simple as asking your best friend, however. \u201cNaming somebody as executor is not an honorary role, you know \u2014 it\u2019s a job,\u201d Mr. Kelso said. \u201cThat comes with responsibilities and a time commitment, and liability.\u201d",
      "David Staehlin, 62, never married nor had children. \u201cI\u2019ve just been happy being single,\u201d he said. He made his first will when he joined the Navy in 1986, leaving everything to his parents. A lot had changed when he updated his will last June.",
      "Since 1996, Mr. Staehlin has lived outside St. Paul, Minn., far from his mother and five siblings, who live in Nebraska, Missouri and Colorado. \u201cI love my family and don\u2019t have any complaints against them,\u201d he said. However, he said, he is not very involved in their lives, given the distance.",
      "Mr. Staehlin plans to leave $10,000 to each of his siblings and his mother. He has also designated 75 percent of his 401(k) plan to his local Veterans of Foreign Wars post, where he volunteers several times a week.",
      "Everything else will go to his two best friends, whom he calls \u201cmy Minnesota family.\u201d Mr. Staehlin met Adam Ford in 2004 when Mr. Ford joined the volunteer St. Paul Police Reserve, where Mr. Staehlin was patrol commander. Soon, Mr. Ford introduced Mr. Staehlin to his partner, Ryan Calvin.",
      "Their friendship quickly deepened. Mr. Staehlin took care of Mr. Ford and Mr. Calvin\u2019s dogs when they traveled. When the couple married, Mr. Staehlin was Mr. Ford\u2019s witness. Mr. Staehlin once returned from vacation to find that the couple had rebuilt his back porch. They took Mr. Staehlin to San Diego to visit the U.S.S. Midway Museum to celebrate his retirement.",
      "Mr. Ford, who is an only child, described Mr. Staehlin as more like a brother than a friend.",
      "Mr. Staehlin first asked Mr. Ford and Mr. Calvin to serve as his primary and secondary health care agents, as his agents under power of attorney and as his executors, and they agreed. The couple already had a sense of the responsibilities: Mr. Calvin, 47, has a law degree, and Mr. Ford, 46, helped his mother when she had to execute the estates of her father and husband when they died within months of each other.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of work in doing this,\u201d Mr. Calvin said. At the same time, it is an honor, he said.",
      "The couple agreed without knowing how much Mr. Staehlin had left them. \u201cAdam and Ryan aren\u2019t doing bad financially,\u201d Mr. Staehlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s an appreciation of their friendship for me. It\u2019ll make their life even a little bit better than it already is.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t even opened the folder with their copy of the will since Mr. Staehlin gave it to them.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to know all the details,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just make the most of life and enjoy it as much as we can.\u201d",
      "Though she grew up and went to college in Colorado Springs, Stephanie Novakowski, 42, lives in Nova Scotia with her husband, a member of the Canadian military. Two years ago, the couple, who have no children, made their wills. The bulk of their assets currently go to their Canadian goddaughter.",
      "Ms. Novakowski, however, has two 401(k) accounts from working in the United States. To avoid international tax issues, she named two college friends who live there as the primary beneficiaries. Retirement accounts, like bank accounts and insurance policies, are \u201cpayable on death\u201d or \u201ctransfer on death\u201d and, therefore, can be passed along without a will if a beneficiary is listed.",
      "\u201cThese are the people that I feel ultimately know me better than sometimes I know myself,\u201d Ms. Novakowski said of her friends.",
      "She based her choices on who she felt would have the greatest need for retirement money. One friend, for example, takes care of her elderly parents as well as her children, and her husband is recovering from cancer.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t know how much savings they\u2019re really going to be able to accumulate by the time they go to retire,\u201d Ms. Novakowski said. A third friend married into wealth, so while she is Ms. Novakowski\u2019s backup health care proxy behind her husband, she is not a beneficiary.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even really generally think of it as my money,\u201d Ms. Novakowski said. \u201cI won\u2019t actually be touching that money unless we really need it.\u201d",
      "The imperfect analogy of friends as family is useful shorthand to explain their importance, given the ",
      " in our society when it comes to intimate, platonic friendships. In the absence of siblings, a partner and children, my friends are the ones who listen to my troubles, celebrate my wins and share my memories.",
      "\u201cAs single children, I think we probably value and regard our friendships perhaps more than people that have had multiple siblings,\u201d Ms. Novakowski said.",
      "Friends can also opt out of obligations without legal or cultural ramifications, which makes me treasure them more: My friends know me and stick with me anyway. Because they have no expectations of inheritance, leaving my assets to them is a joyful act.",
      "As Mr. Kelso asked: \u201cWhy are we leaving money to people anyway? Is it because they deserve it? Is it because they need it? Is it based on how much I love them?\u201d",
      "I don\u2019t know about merit, but I plan to pay attention to need when dividing my assets. Love is a given. Having assets to pass on is a privilege. Having friends to leave them to is a gift."

      "Mounting concerns over young people\u2019s mental health have prompted state legislatures across the country to propose a slew of age restrictions to protect minors online. Lawmakers say the rules should help shield young people from online pornography, predators and harmful social media posts.",
      "The current push for age restrictions on certain online content echoes a similar legislative drive three decades ago, when the internet was in its infancy. In 1996, Congress passed a major telecommunications bill that made it illegal to knowingly send or display \u201cobscene or indecent\u201d material to people under 18.",
      "That law had a longstanding precedent: federal rules dating ",

      ". But civil liberties groups thought the prohibitions on online indecency violated the First Amendment and squelched free speech. Among other objections, they said it was too difficult and expensive for websites to verify a visitor\u2019s age. That could have led sites to simply get rid of anything inappropriate for children, creating a Disneyfied internet.",
      "To protect Americans\u2019 access to information that could potentially be deemed indecent under the new law \u2014 like educational material about AIDS \u2014 the American Civil Liberties Union sued the government, challenging part of ",
      " called the Communications Decency Act.",
      "The A.C.L.U. wanted its name on the lawsuit, said ",
      ", a former senior lawyer for the group. But to be a plaintiff, the group needed to be directly threatened by the law and there was nothing on its website that could potentially \u201charm\u201d children. So the A.C.L.U. uploaded ",

      "After a federal court in Philadelphia temporarily halted the law, the government appealed, and the case, Reno v. A.C.L.U., named for Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney general, Janet Reno, was taken up by the Supreme Court. There, the A.C.L.U. argued that\u00a0the law\u2019s speech restrictions could curb the internet\u2019s unique potential and prevent people \u2014 including minors \u2014 from having access to all kinds of information.",

      "Language in printed material, which individuals freely perused, was more lightly regulated than in broadcast media, where audiences had less control over what they were exposed to.",

      "The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the A.C.L.U., finding that the federal restrictions could chill free speech.",
      "The judges said the blanket restrictions were unacceptable because parents would soon be able to use content-filtering software to protect their children, and because age-verification systems at the time, which had typically involved verifying a user\u2019s credit card, were not yet widely available",
      "(That has changed; today, many current online age-checking systems use credentials like a driver\u2019s licenses to verify a user\u2019s age. One vendor said they were now easily integrated and cost as little as 10 cents per visitor.)",
      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court upheld a longstanding principle in American law that \u201cyou can\u2019t censor speech to adults in the name of protecting minors,\u201d Mr. ",

The legislation would require online services that are likely to be used by young people \u2014 such as social media and video game platforms \u2014 to default to the highest privacy settings possible for minors.",

      "That\u2019s because Louisiana lawmakers had passed ",
      " last year requiring publishers of online material that could be \u201charmful to minors\u201d to verify that their users were adults.",
      "Louisiana is at the forefront of a sweeping national push to insulate young people from potentially harmful content by requiring certain online services to bar or limit minors on their platforms. As a result, people in many other states may soon find that they, too, need to use credentials like digitized drivers\u2019 licenses to access a host of services, including popular social media apps.",
      "The proposed restrictions, introduced by at least two dozen states over the last year, could alter not only the online experiences of children and adolescents. They could also remake the internet for millions of adults, ushering in a tectonic\u00a0cultural shift to a stricter, age-gated online world.",
      "The spate of new bills may come as a relief to parents who worry that their children are being bombarded by sexualized images or targeted by strangers online. But civil liberties groups say that certain bills could make it difficult for Americans, including minors, to view online information they have a constitutional right to see, violating free speech principles.",
      "Utah and Arkansas recently enacted laws that would require social apps like TikTok and Instagram to verify their users\u2019 ages and ",
      " before granting accounts to minors. While many sites already ask people signing up for accounts for their birth dates \u2014 a self-reporting system that children can often subvert by entering a fake birth year \u2014 the new state rules could prompt many platforms to institute more\u00a0stringent age-verification systems involving government IDs.",
      "In late April, four U.S. senators introduced the \u201cProtecting Kids on Social Media Act.\u201d ",
      " would require social networks to verify users\u2019 ages, bar children under 13 and obtain parental consent for users who are 13 to 17.",

      " that watching online porn as a child had \u201cdestroyed my brain.\u201d",
      "Ms. Schlegel said she believed the digital world needed the same kind of adult zones that exist in the physical world, where consumers are often asked to show a government ID before they can buy alcohol. As an example, she noted that Louisiana already required online gambling and alcohol delivery services to verify patrons\u2019 ages through credentials like drivers\u2019 licenses.",
      "\u201cWe have agreed as a society not to let a 15-year-old go to a bar or a strip club,\u201d Ms. Schlegel said. \u201cThe same protections should be in place online so that you know a 10-year-old is not looking at hard-core pornography.\u201d",
      "Ms. Schlegel added that she had crafted her age-verification bill with possible free speech challenges in mind. To try to avoid sweeping in health platforms, she said, the Louisiana measure covers sexually explicit sites where the content meets a longstanding legal test for \u201cmaterial harmful to minors.\u201d",
      "But civil liberties experts said that some of the proposed restrictions on harmful material and social media sites could create age-verification barriers for Americans seeking to freely access online information. If the rules were not overturned, these experts argue, they could radically alter the internet \u2014 by changing the online world into a patchwork of walled-off fiefdoms or causing popular platforms to narrow their offerings to avoid triggering the rules.",

      "Civil liberties groups said they were considering litigation to try to halt certain new laws.",
      "Attempts to impose age restrictions on the internet have faced constitutional challenges in the past. In 1997, the Supreme Court struck down federal rules that would have made it illegal to knowingly send or display \u201cobscene or indecent\u201d material to people under 18, saying the rules curtailed free speech.",
      "At the time, age-verification software was not yet widely available online. That is no longer the case.",
      "Louisiana emerged as a national leader on the issue partly because it had ready-made technology in place: a state-approved mobile app, called \u201cLA Wallet,\u201d that allows residents to make digital scans of their Louisiana driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "LA Wallet works by\u00a0verifying a\u00a0user\u2019s ID with the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles. That allows Louisianans\u00a0to use the app as they would a physical license to, say, prove their age at a bar.",
      "After the age-verification law for online pornography took effect in January, the number of new users on LA Wallet more than tripled to about 5,200 a day, according to ",
      ", the Louisiana software company behind the app. Now, when Louisiana users visit a site like Pornhub, the site asks them to enter a unique code to verify their age via LA Wallet. The app then checks the user\u2019s age and\u00a0notifies the porn site if the person is an adult.",
      "The system is designed to protect privacy, said Calvin Fabre, the president of Envoc. LA Wallet does not send personal information about its users to porn sites, he said, nor does it\u00a0retain information about the sites for which its users request age verification. ",

      "Even so, there are loopholes. To get around the age checks, for instance, people in Louisiana may\u00a0use location-masking software, which can make them appear to be in another state.",

Airline employees report glimpsing ghosts and claim that Native American music is played at night to appease the spirits of the dead buried below (Ms. Stegman said there are no graves and that the music is part of an art installation that, if not for a finicky sound system, would be on all the time). Uber drivers believe that dirt left over from the airport\u2019s construction was used to create artificial mountains to stash food for the apocalypse (Ms. Stegman just laughed and said she had not heard that one).",
      "When the Denver airport opened in 1995, it was ",
      " and $2 billion over budget. The difficulties attracted legal complaints and ",
      ", but also rumors, spread online and locally, that the extra time and cost had gone toward sinister design modifications \u2014 including more than a hundred miles of tunnels leading to subterranean meeting facilities, survival bunkers, deep underground military bases and even the North American Aerospace Defense Command near Colorado Springs.",
      "The airport\u2019s isolated location and disorienting size \u2014 the land that it owns makes it the second-largest airport in the world, after the King Fahd International Airport in Saudi Arabia, and bigger than actual U.S.\u00a0cities, such as San Francisco \u2014 lends itself to online mumblings that it will someday be used as a prison or concentration camp by a mysterious totalitarian global government known as the New World Order.",
      "But the airport\u2019s enormous layout, according to Ms. Stegman, was actually a visionary effort to factor in\u00a0future growth and efficiency. If anything, the design should have been more ambitious \u2014 it was intended to support 50 million travelers a year, but nearly 70 million people passed through last year, and nearly 100 million a year are expected by 2030.",
      "To address the squeeze, the airport recently began a $1.3 billion project to upgrade and expand its Great Hall. The work has pushed some of its most peculiar points of interest out of sight.",
      "That includes a pair of 28-foot ",
      " by Leo Tanguma, meant to depict humanity existing peacefully with the environment in postwar harmony. But over the decades, a far more alarming interpretation\u00a0developed: that the artwork\u2019s images of a soldier in a gas mask wielding a rifle and a sword, ruined buildings and weeping mothers cradling lifeless children were a prophetic vision of the end of the world.",
      "Unlike pieces in a museum or gallery, art in airports is often experienced as a surprise, said Sarah Magnatta, an assistant professor of global contemporary art at the University of Denver. Murals or installations in a terminal can increase exposure for local artists and add dimension to an otherwise utilitarian space, she said.",
      "\u201cI actually think that\u2019s the best way to view art \u2014 when it kind of happens to you,\u201d Dr. Magnatta said. \u201cIt\u2019s art that is made a part of everyday life, and you\u2019re forced to encounter it whether you want to or not, which can be a really powerful thing and a starting point for conversation.\u201d",
      "The removal of the Denver airport murals sparked rumors in Telegram channels and Reddit forums that construction was a cover for burying the truth. Ms. Stegman said the airport will always embrace \u201cthe conspiracy part\u201d of its identity but is not trying to hide anything.",
      "As for the mystery disappearance of the murals? They\u2019re in temporary storage to avoid damage, and will return."

      "Federal regulators were racing over the weekend to seize and sell the troubled First Republic Bank before financial markets open on Monday, according to people with knowledge of the matter, in a bid to put an end to a banking crisis that began last month with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.",
      "The effort, led by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, comes after First Republic\u2019s shares ",
      " since Monday, when the bank disclosed that customers had withdrawn more than half of its deposits. It became clear this past week that nobody was willing to ride to ",
      "\u2019s rescue before a government seizure because larger banks were worried that buying the company would saddle them with billions of dollars in losses.",
      "The F.D.I.C. has been talking with banks that include JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Services and Bank of America about a potential deal, three of the people said. A deal could be announced as soon as Sunday, these people said, cautioning the situation was rapidly evolving and might still change. Any buyer would most likely assume the deposits of First Republic, eliminating the need for a government guarantee of deposits in excess of $250,000 \u2014 the limit for deposit insurance.",
      "As of Sunday morning, at least a few bidders had been told that they had until noon to submit their offers, according to two people familiar with the matter. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation did not comment.",
      "It\u2019s possible that an agreement won\u2019t be reached, in which case the F.D.I.C. would need to decide if it would seize First Republic anyway and take ownership itself. In that case, federal officials could invoke a systemic risk exception to protect those bigger deposits, something they did after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March.",
      "If officials decided against that, some economists warned that the consequences could be serious.",
      "\u201cThe government needs to act in a way where the uninsured depositors get their money out in whole,\u201d Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary now at Harvard, said in an interview on Saturday, either through a takeover or by a government guarantee.",
      "Failing to do so \u201cruns a substantial risk of setting off a wave of further withdrawals from all but the largest of institutions,\u201d he added.",
      "The F.D.I.C. started sounding out potential buyers late last week as it became clear that there were few options outside a government takeover, one of the people said. By Friday, it had asked potential bidders to submit binding offers by Sunday, this person said. Those potential bidders have been given access to detailed information on First Republic\u2019s finances, one of the people said.",
      "The people requested anonymity because the process is confidential. ",
      " and ",
      " reported the talks earlier. The F.D.I.C. declined to comment. The F.D.I.C. is working with the financial advisory firm Guggenheim Partners on the process, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.",
      "Regulations preclude JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America from acquiring another deposit-taking bank because of their size, and regulators would have to grant an exemption if one of those banks were to acquire First Republic.",
      "Some progressive Democrats were not thrilled about the idea of having a large bank like JPMorgan take over First Republic, given that such a deal would make the already huge institution larger, and that probably tilted things slightly toward PNC, one person familiar with the situation said. Some other smaller regional banks also showed some interest in First Republic, this person said.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, PNC and Bank of America were part of a consortium of 11 large banks that temporarily ",
      " into First Republic last month as part of an industry effort to prop up the bank. But that lifeline did little to put to rest concerns about First Republic\u2019s viability.",
      "First Republic, which is based in San Francisco and has most of its branches on the coasts where it serves affluent customers who work in industries like technology and finance, has been considered the most vulnerable regional bank since the banking crisis began unfolding in March with the ",
      ". First Republic spooked investors and customers anew by revealing on Monday that it had lost $102 billion in customer deposits, much of it in just three weeks in March, not including the $30 billion in deposits it received from the 11 big banks. The outflow was well over half the $176 billion it held at the end of last year.",
      "Like Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic has also suffered losses on its loans and investments as the Federal Reserve rapidly raised interest rates to fight inflation.",
      "First Republic had been hoping to strike a deal before being put into F.D.I.C. receivership, because a government seizure would mean shareholders of the company and some of its bondholders would probably lose all or most of their investment. Until Thursday night, the bank and its advisers remained in conversation with the government, some banks and private equity firms about a potential deal. But neither the government nor the banks, were ultimately interested in such an arrangement, one of the people said.",
      "By Friday morning, it was clear to everybody involved that First Republic had no option other than a government takeover, the people said. First Republic\u2019s stock closed Friday down another 43 percent and continued falling in extended trading.",
      "First Republic was worth just $650 million as of Friday afternoon, down from more than $20 billion before the March crisis, a reflection of investors\u2019 realization that shareholders could be wiped out.",
      "A sale to a larger bank would likely mean that all of First Republic\u2019s deposits are protected since they would become accounts at the acquiring bank. That includes uninsured deposits, which stood at $50 billion at the end of March \u2014 a sum that includes the $30 billion from the 11 big banks.",
      "By seeking to line up a buyer for First Republic before formally putting the bank into receivership, regulators appear to be hoping to avoid the tumult that characterized the fall of Silicon Valley Bank. It took several weeks for government officials to sell that bank\u2019s remnants to ",
      ", in a deal that included about $72 billion in loans at a deeply discounted price.",
      "And the government appeared to be learning from the fall of Silicon Valley Bank in another way: The information it provided on First Republic\u2019s financial situation to potential buyers was much more detailed than what it provided in the case of Silicon Valley Bank, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Government officials spent additional time putting together a more cleaned-up set of facts that mapped out the bank\u2019s relationships and risks.",
      "The government prefers to find a buyer for a failed bank as quickly as possible to minimize potential losses to the government\u2019s deposit insurance fund. The longer it takes to find a buyer, the more likely that customers and employees will abandon a failed bank, leaving behind a rapidly withering business.",
      "PNC, one of the country\u2019s largest regional banks that is based in Pittsburgh, had previously considered buying First Republic. But PNC couldn\u2019t make a deal work because it would have to take on large losses from First Republic\u2019s relatively low-rate home mortgages and other loans, according to one of the people. The challenges of accounting for First Republic\u2019s loans put off other potential buyers, too.",
      "JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was a key ",
      " of the plan to inject $30 billion into First Republic Bank. During the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Dimon led the rescue of two banks \u2014 Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual."

      "An old Klingon proverb tells us, \u201cOnly a fool fights in a burning house.\u201d In light of that bit of wisdom from \u201cStar Trek,\u201d it might seem surprising that the Writers Guild of America West and East, the sister unions that represent the country\u2019s film and television writers, are engaged in a fraught labor negotiation with the studios and streaming companies that could lead, after their contract expires on May 1, to Hollywood\u2019s biggest strike in 15 years.",
      "Looking at the current state of the entertainment industry, we see a theatrical business still struggling to recover from Covid-era disruptions and a television landscape of consolidation and cutbacks in the wake of an unsustainable boom in streaming content.",
      "Surely this must be the absolute worst possible time for writers to strike and shut down scripted programming, right?",
      "Well, yes. Unfortunately, the current negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (an organization that represents the old Hollywood studios and upstart streaming companies alike) are absolutely make or break for writers. At stake is nothing less than the survival of film and television writing as a viable middle-class career for the majority of our membership.",
      "To be fair, screenwriting has always been a precarious, feast-or-famine way to make a living. With untold thousands drawn by the real and perceived glamour and wealth of Hollywood, the odds of selling a script or getting hired onto a show are long \u2014 like, high school football star making it in the N.F.L. long. Continuing to succeed consistently over the course of a career can often seem next to impossible.",
      "I only made it into the W.G.A. after eight years of rejection, working as a journalist by day and tapping out screenplays every evening until eventually getting hired onto a since-forgotten syndicated action hour, \u201cGene Roddenberry\u2019s Andromeda.\u201d It was the absolute lowest rung of scripted entertainment, but at the time it felt like heaven, and even paid enough for my little family to buy a home in an unglamorous corner of the San Fernando Valley.",
      "But after three seasons of steady television work and a screenplay credit on the hit movie \u201cAgent Cody Banks,\u201d my luck finally ran out. It took nearly three more years of meetings, pitches that went nowhere and buying groceries on credit cards before I got regular work again.",
      "Luckily, the W.G.A.\u2019s health insurance plan is structured so writers bank points that let us keep coverage between jobs, or else my family\u2019s financial solvency would have been in serious doubt. The W.G.A.\u2019s members make on average around $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s before taxes, union dues and commissions to agents, managers and lawyers. The reality is that the seemingly big paychecks of Hollywood have to last through the lean periods that nearly every writer experiences.",
      "Traditionally, one of the biggest buffers against that volatility is residuals: the money that writers earn from the reuse of our work, encompassing everything from cable and syndicated reruns of old television episodes to airlines licensing movies for in-flight viewing. The formulas used to calculate the money owed for various forms of reuse are complicated and vary widely across platforms. As a result, the payments can be relatively tiny or very large \u2014 and one of the more delightful parts of being a working screenwriter is opening your mailbox and seeing the distinctive green envelope that residuals come in, not knowing if the check inside will cover an In-N-Out burger or your mortgage payment.",
      "But the odds of a big check that bails out a writer in dire financial straights are growing ever longer. Programming is moving increasingly away from theatrical, broadcast and cable to streaming platforms, which typically pay residuals at a far lower rate. This is why one of the major areas in our current negotiation is bringing streaming residuals more in line with broadcast and cable rates.",
      "The issues being hashed out at the bargaining table include increasing the minimum compensation for writers and strengthening so-called span protection, which ensures that writers are paid fairly if the time spent creating a TV episode extends beyond two and a half weeks, as the industry shifts from the 22-episodes-a-year world of network television to the eight-episodes-every-18-months-if-you\u2019re-lucky model embraced by streaming companies. The W.G.A. is also pushing to address the proliferation in streaming television of so-called mini rooms \u2014 writing staffs that are smaller in size and active for a shorter duration than a traditional writers\u2019 room.",
      "The studios and streamers are, of course, loath to part with any more money than they need to. They point to their battered stock prices, reduced box office revenue and round after round of layoffs as evidence that things are tough all over.",
      "But allowing screenwriters to sustain a stable career is absolutely the smartest investment that the industry can make. After all, writers\u2019 imaginations are the ultimate source of the movies and shows that generate billions of dollars for their parent companies. One of my biggest thrills is walking onto a soundstage where grips are banging together a set and realizing that hundreds of people and millions of dollars have been marshaled to bring to life a scenario that once existed only in my brain.",
      "Keeping that spigot of creativity open is only possible if writers don\u2019t have to scramble for day jobs or contemplate a career switch every time the phone stops ringing. Marc Cherry created the hit show \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d while living on his \u201cGolden Girls\u201d residuals. And I wouldn\u2019t be able to spin my stories of rival wolf dynasties, cursed mountain climbers and quests for immortality were it not for the financial buffer provided by my good friends Thor and the X-Men.",
      "The last thing we need is for film and television to become like the music industry, another creative field disrupted by the internet and tech money, where the middle class has been hollowed out while risk has been pushed from the companies onto the artists themselves. The W.G.A.\u2019s fight isn\u2019t just about keeping writers employed but about maintaining the health of the entire ecosystem that makes our industry run and keeps the supply of quality film and television flowing for viewers around the world.",
      "I do worry that some of my fellow writers \u2014 especially younger ones who joined during the streaming-driven boom years, when the number of writers in the W.G.A. reporting earnings grew from 4,500 to more than 6,000 \u2014 have unrealistic ideas about what a successful negotiation can accomplish. No contract can bring back the 1990s model of shows that ran 22-episode seasons for eight years, or fully reinflate the 2010s streaming bubble. Whether we win concessions from the studios at the bargaining table or even through a strike, the brutal reality remains that, going forward, there will likely be fewer well-paying jobs in a volatile industry that may force us to hustle for work more than ever.",
      "So can the W.G.A., the studios and the streamers come to terms without a strike? Or are our positions irreconcilable?",
      "Conventional wisdom in Hollywood right now is that a strike \u2014 possibly a long one \u2014 is inevitable. But I\u2019m still hopeful that the two sides can reach a compromise that keeps the industry working, because regardless of whether they realize it, doing right by the writers is an investment that will benefit the companies that employ us, as well. Like my hero Captain James T. Kirk, I don\u2019t believe in a no-win scenario.",
      "Zack Stentz is a screenwriter and the co-writer of \u201cThor\u201d and \u201cX-Men: First Class,\u201d and has written for the TV shows \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cFringe.\u201d"

      "Oxford Economics did an initial run of its election forecasting model, which takes economic factors into account, and found that Biden is in line to get around 55 percent of the popular vote, without any assumption about his opponent, according to a research briefing on Wednesday. Paul Krugman, my Opinion colleague, ",

      "The truth is, though, that we really don\u2019t know who will win the 2024 election, or even what role the economy will play in it. As somebody who writes about economics, I\u2019d love to say that the state of the economy leading up to Nov. 5, 2024, will matter a lot. But that does not seem to be the case, according to people I spoke with this week. One possible reason is that voters have become more polarized and set in their preferences, and thus less swayed by the ups and downs of the economy.",
      "For example, let\u2019s say former President Donald Trump captures the Republican nomination. Most Biden supporters wouldn\u2019t vote for him no matter how bad the economy got in 2024 \u2014 just as most Trump supporters won\u2019t vote for Biden no matter how good the economy gets under the incumbent. James Carville\u2019s ",

      " by the Yale economist Ray Fair, \u201cThe Effect of Economic Events on Votes for President,\u201d made the case that \u201ceconomic events as measured by the change in real economic activity in the year of the election do appear to have an important effect on votes for president.\u201d In January, the model ",
      ", using his economic projections as inputs, that Biden, if renominated, would get 50.07 percent of the two-party presidential vote next year, with no assumption about the Republican opponent.",
      "Fair\u2019s model, which he has tweaked over the years, correctly predicted the winner of the popular vote in every election from 1980 through 2008 except for 1992, when it incorrectly predicted Bill Clinton would get only 43 percent of the two-party popular vote against George H.W. Bush. It hasn\u2019t done well lately, though: It predicted the Democrat would get less than half the popular vote in the two-candidate matchup in 2012, when President Barack Obama won a second term; in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost to Trump in the Electoral College; and in 2020, when Biden beat Trump.",
      "I asked Fair if it was fair to say that polarization of voters has weakened the predictive value of economic indicators. He acknowledged that Trump, an especially polarizing figure, had underperformed in both 2016 and 2020 given economic conditions that the Fair model considered favorable to him. (And he said it could happen again if Trump is the G.O.P. candidate next year.) But he said he\u2019s not convinced that his economic model has lost its predictive power. \u201cPersonally, I think there\u2019s still a pretty big middle group\u201d of voters who are influenced by economic factors, he said.",
      "A good example of why it\u2019s dangerous to over-rely on economic models is what happened in the spring of 2020, when Covid hit. Based on historical patterns, several of the best-known models (though not Fair\u2019s) put a heavy weight on how the economy performs in the second quarter of an election year, namely April through June. Because of the Covid shutdown, the gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 29.9 percent in the second quarter of 2020. Going by that one data point, the election should have been a disaster for the incumbent, Trump. But voters understood that Trump couldn\u2019t be blamed for Covid. What\u2019s more, the economy grew at an annual rate of 35.3 percent in the following quarter as it rebounded from the shutdown. In the end, Trump did worse than Fair\u2019s model had predicted, but way better than predicted by models that heavily weighted second-quarter economic growth.",
      "Another problem with some economics-based forecasting models such as Fair\u2019s is that they predict the popular vote, rather than the one that really matters, the Electoral College vote, which depends on state-by-state results. Fair is sticking to forecasting the popular vote because he thinks it\u2019s of academic interest. Some other forecasters have switched to predicting the Electoral College result, but it\u2019s much trickier. The outcome of the election comes down to a handful of swing states, and within those few states, to the behavior of a small minority of voters whose minds aren\u2019t made up. \u201cThe Electoral College throws a monkey wrench into the business,\u201d Alan Abramowitz, an emeritus professor of political science at Emory University, told me.",
      "One thing that puzzles me is why it\u2019s even worthwhile to plug economic factors into an election forecast. If the relevance of the economy is that it affects voters\u2019 feelings about the candidates, why not just cut to the chase and focus on the voters\u2019 feelings? (Nate Cohn, my colleague on the news side, pointed out this week in another ",
      " that the polls are showing a tight contest, with Biden slightly ahead of Trump and slightly behind Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in hypothetical matchups.)",
      "I asked Charles Tien, a political science professor at the City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center and Hunter College, why he and others put economic indicators into their models. \u201cWhen you add in the economy, it improves the results,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged that it\u2019s not obvious why that\u2019s the case. When I asked Fair the same question by email, he wrote, \u201cMy empirical results are quite strong that the economy has mattered over time.\u201d I wonder if it\u2019s because economic indicators signal something about voters\u2019 situations that they don\u2019t fully express in surveys, which in any case have become less reliable as response rates have declined.",
      "Peter Enns, a political scientist at Cornell who ran the Cornell-based Roper Center for Public Opinion Research until last year, told me he thinks it\u2019s too soon for predictions about the 2024 race. First, because there are too many unknowns, such as the field of candidates and the business cycle. Second, because at this stage voters should be focusing on who should win, not who will win. OK, that\u2019s fair. No more horse-race prognosticating from me. For now.",

Holy fools dwell in ordinary, secular life, but they approach it with completely different values. Rejecting respectability and embracing humility and love, holy fools are so profoundly out of step with the broader world that they appear to be ridiculous or even insane and often invite ridicule. And yet, they teach the rest of us how to live.",

It\u2019s about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves on and off the field.\u201d It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, of course, the kind of thing uttered as a sound bite in high school sports.

His marriage has dissolved. He longs to be nearer to his son back in the States (I find myself asking in the third season, as does Ted, why is he still in England?). Yet his incessant, childlike faith in people \u2014 his foolishness \u2014 allows Ted to lavish love on those around him. And wherever he goes \u2014 from the locker room to a meeting of the Diamond Dogs, his makeshift male support group \u2014 community flourishes.

      "In a time when our culture is marked by outrage, division and cynicism, Ted Lasso calls us back to humility. He asks us to lighten up a little, to not take ourselves too seriously. In doing so, he reminds everyone he encounters \u2014 including us watching at home \u2014 of our shared humanity. We are all, in the end, not winners or losers, successes or failures, pure heroes or villains, but people who long to be known, loved and delighted in. This is the gift of Ted Lasso.

It was clear that the virus was novel, that it was spreading widely and that it was killing many of the people it infected. And there was no vaccine or proven drug treatment. This was the context in which states first mandated masks, issued stay-at-home orders and closed schools, among other measures \u2014 an emergency.",

Which side is right? \u200c",
      "\u200cAs with most things about th\u200ce Covid pandemic, the answer is most likely somewhere in between. \u200c",
      "There is good evidence that masks can protect \u200c\u200cpeople who use them correctly and consistently. Laboratory studies clearly show that wearing a mask properly, when in the presence of the virus, will reduce \u200ca person\u2019s exposure to \u200c\u200cit. Other studies show that higher-quality masks, such as N95 respirators, are better able to keep the virus out than less well-fitting surgical masks or cloth masks.",
      "The confusion occurs when we shift from\u200c showing that masks",
      "work in a laboratory or for individual people to finding evidence that masking",
      "works at the population level\u200c and what interventions work to encourage it. At the population level, compliance and mask quality may vary, making it \u200cdifficult to find evidence to review on the effectiveness of masking in reducing the number of respiratory infections. \u200c\u200cThe Cochrane review tried to \u200c\u200cuntangle the evidence in one analysis. \u200cAnd according to that limited evidence, masking at the population level did not have a clear impact on reducing infections.",
      "How can this be? Part of the reason has to do with the quality of studies on masking. Though there have been studies observing differences in disease rates between places with masking policies and those without, evidence from these observational studies isn\u2019t of the highest quality because it doesn\u2019t fully account for other differences between masking and nonmasking populations.",
      "To address the quality issue of these studies, the Cochrane review looked only at randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness of masking. Randomized trials are particularly helpful for studying the impact of health interventions within populations because they help to minimize bias and confusion caused by other factors besides the one you are trying to evaluate. For example, if you looked at infections among people who choose to mask versus those who don\u2019t, you may be observing not just the effect of masking but also the effects of other protective decisions that people who are inclined to mask may also take, such as \u200cavoiding crowded indoor spaces.",
      "\u200cThere have been only a few randomized trials specific to masking, and most of the ones included in the Cochrane review were not conducted during the \u200cCovid-19 pandemic or in the United States. \u200c\u200cMany of the studies that the Cochrane review included looked at the spread of influenza.",
      "This is important because while we think there are some similarities between how \u200cthe novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses are spread, there also are likely to be important differences. \u200cCovid proved to be deadlier than seasonal influenza, which may have influenced how often and well people wore masks. Masking for Covid was also mandated throughout much of the United States, which most likely also influenced masking behavior.",
      "The pertinent question isn\u2019t whether masks work but why \u200c\u200cmasking didn\u2019t prove to be highly effective in the most rigorous studies. Was it because adherence to masking, not the masks themselves, was the problem? Is it because the population studied\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200c wore masks when around infected people but then got infected from family members? Maybe people didn\u2019t wear masks properly because they weren\u2019t comfortable or they didn\u2019t fit. Knowing the answers to these questions will help us know how best to use masks and help us better control the spread of infections. The Cochrane review authors ",
      " their examination was limited to whether interventions to promote mask wearing help to slow the spread of respiratory viruses. It\u2019s important to note that masks only work when people wear them, so adherence will always be the key.",
      "In early 2020, when we knew little about the virus but saw its toll, masks were a reasonable step because they had few harms. Considering the rapid spread of the virus and its deadly impact, we could not wait until we had all the data to understand how best to use them. And if a new, deadly respiratory disease emerged tomorrow, we\u2019d have few tools besides masks to prevent spread and protect ourselves.",
      "But we should have put into place efforts to rapidly collect and assess high-quality data to understand whether masks were having optimal effectiveness and, if not, how to increase that effectiveness. We should have done this for other mitigations, too, like school and business closings and policies that required exposed contacts of cases to quarantine. \u200cPandemic measures like masking and vaccination have been challenged by political leaders and in the courts. Without clear evidence at the population level that mitigation measures meaningfully change transmission rates, it will be harder to meet challenges that could block effective, life\u200csaving interventions.",
      "We \u200cneed to develop clear plans for \u200crandomized and other well-designed studies and get them funded. A ",
      " of research by investigators affiliated with U.S. governmental public health entities during the pandemic found very few studies that evaluated the impact of measures to control the spread of disease. It is ludicrous to simply hope academic researchers will spontaneously choose and muster the resources necessary to address the most pressing pandemic response questions. Just as we have established research networks and protocols to conduct the highest-quality evaluations of the effectiveness of vaccines, we should have the same for nonpharmaceutical interventions, like masking. We can and must identify the highest-priority research questions and the funding to systematically and rigorously investigate them.",

      "Anyway, trying to be tough-minded can cause political and public relations problems, too. Many economists, even among progressives, use ",
      " as an important indicator of \u201cunderlying\u201d inflation (although that\u2019s a ",
      ", as I wrote earlier this week). You need, however, to be careful not to suggest \u2014 as Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, ",
      " \u2014 that greedy workers are the villains behind inflation.",
      "Which brings me to the furor created by some ",
      " by Huw Pill, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist (what is it with the B.O.E., anyway?), to the effect that British inflation \u2014 which has been running ",
      " than inflation here \u2014 reflects a general unwillingness on the part of workers and others to \u201caccept the fact that they\u2019re worse off.\u201d",
      "Foot, enter mouth.",
      "But clumsiness aside, was Pill\u2019s diagnosis correct? The answer, I\u2019d argue, is that there was some truth to his analysis, but for the United States, at least, a lot of it was wrong \u2014 and I suspect that this is true for Britain as well.",
      "What Pill got right was describing inflation as a game of \u201cpass the parcel\u201d: Everyone is trying to get ahead by raising prices, but because everyone else is doing the same thing, on average, any gains people get from higher prices for the things they sell are offset by higher prices for the things they buy. So the overall effect of efforts by individual players to make gains at others\u2019 expense is inflation, which hurts everyone. A few months ago I wrote about the ",
      ", in which everyone stands up to get a better view, with the result that nobody\u2019s view is improved but everyone is less comfortable. That still seems right.",
      "What\u2019s more dubious about Pill\u2019s story is that he attributes this zero-sum jockeying for position to an attempt to avoid an inevitable decline in real income, brought on largely by higher energy prices. Although he was careful to include price hikes by firms as well as wage demands in his discussion, this is still basically the classic wage-price-spiral story. In that story, workers see a rise in their cost of living, say, because of surging energy prices, and demand wage increases to offset these losses \u2014 but firms then raise prices to reflect higher labor costs, and off we go.",
      "Well, for what it\u2019s worth, the International Monetary Fund has looked at data across several countries and found ",
      " that wage-price spirals are developing. And in the United States I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of one, either. Wage growth did accelerate, but this seems to have been mainly because workers were in demand in a very tight labor market. Indeed, wage growth has come down from its peak (although it\u2019s still running ",
      ") as indicators of labor-market tightness like the ",
      " come down.",
      "If anything, in the United States we have seen something like what Lael Brainard, the former second-in-command at the Fed and now the Biden administration\u2019s chief economist, calls a \u201c",
      ",\u201d in which some firms raise prices more than their costs go up. At least some of this may have involved firms believing that they could get away with exceptional price hikes because customers wouldn\u2019t notice in a time of widespread price hikes. (There\u2019s a lot about this in this paywalled ",
      ".)",
      "Now, Britain, which relies a lot on imported natural gas, has taken a much bigger real income hit from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine than the United States, which is a gas exporter. So the British story may be different. But my guess is that for the most part the overall picture is similar: Inflation mainly reflecting the combination of various disruptions and an overheated economy, rather than the obstinate unwillingness of ordinary workers to face reality.",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean that curing inflation will be painless. The latest data on U.S. wages, which seems to show them moving sideways rather than down, suggest that our economy still needs to cool further, which might involve a rise in the unemployment rate. But economists especially, although not only those with public positions, need to avoid even the appearance of blaming workers for the problem."

      "SARASOTA, Fla. \u2014 When I first met Matthew Lepinski, the faculty chair of New College of Florida, he was willing to give the right-wingers sent to remake his embattled progressive public school a chance.",
      "This was in January, a few weeks after Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida appointed six activist conservatives, including the culture war strategist Chris Rufo, to New College\u2019s board of trustees. Rufo, the ideological entrepreneur who made critical race theory a Republican boogeyman, was ",
      " about his ambition to turn the quirky, L.G.B.T.Q.-friendly liberal arts school into a public version of Hillsdale, a conservative Christian college in Michigan with close ties to both ",
      " and ",
      ". He hoped the transformation would be proof of concept for his dream: a conservative takeover of higher education across the country.",
      "So when Rufo and another new trustee, Eddie Speir, the co-founder of a private Christian school called Inspiration Academy, arrived at New College for meetings with students and faculty, they were received with skepticism and hostility. But Lepinski, a computer science professor and the faculty representative on the board of trustees, was hopeful that they might figure out a way to work together, and he urged the school community to hear them out.",
      "In the ensuing months, there was concern among Lepinski\u2019s colleagues that he wasn\u2019t doing enough to stand up to their new overlords. \u201cSome of us had been a little frustrated with his willingness to try and play nice,\u201d Amy Reid, a French professor and the head of New College\u2019s gender studies program, told me. But Lepinski believed in dialogue and compromise. \u201cI thought maybe there was a path forward with this board where we could focus on the things that unite us instead of the things that divide us,\u201d he said.",
      "That\u2019s why it was so striking when, at the end of a combative three-hour meeting on Wednesday in which the trustees rejected five tenure applications, Lepinski quit. He\u2019s not just leaving the board, but New College altogether. \u201cI can no longer see a way that I can be effective here, given the current board of trustees,\u201d he said at an impromptu news conference afterward.",
      "When I ",
      " in early January, he said that New College would look very different in the following 120 days. Nearly four months later, that hasn\u2019t entirely come to pass, but it\u2019s clear where things are headed.",
      "The new trustees fired the school\u2019s president, replacing her with Richard Corcoran, the Republican former speaker of the Florida House. They ",
      " its chief diversity officer and dismantled the diversity, equity and inclusion office. As I was writing this on Friday, several people sent me photographs of gender-neutral signage scraped off school bathrooms.",
      "But day-to-day, students, parents, and professors told me, life at New College has been pretty much the same. Faculty have mostly been left alone to do their jobs. Corcoran, several professors said, was rarely on campus. Sam Sharf, who chose New College in part because she feels safe there as a trans woman, said that classroom discussions in her Politics of the African Diaspora and Alternatives to Capitalism classes haven\u2019t changed, though she\u2019s constantly aware that such subjects might soon be taboo, and is planning to transfer.",
      "Whatever New College\u2019s administration does, this will likely be the last year classes like the ones Sharf is taking are offered, because a ",
      " making its way through the Florida Legislature requires the review of curriculums \u201cbased on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States.\u201d The sense of dread on campus, however, goes beyond what\u2019s happening in Tallahassee.",
      "Eliana Salzhauer, whose 17-year-old son is a New College economics student, compared the seemingly inexorable transformation of the school to Twitter under Elon Musk: It looked the same at first, even as it gradually degraded into a completely different experience. \u201cThey are turning a ",
      " academic institution into a third-rate athletic facility,\u201d she said.",
      "Salzhauer was referring, in part, to the hiring of Mariano Jimenez, who previously worked at Speir\u2019s Inspiration Academy, as athletic director and head baseball coach, even though there\u2019s no baseball diamond on campus. In the past, New College hasn\u2019t had traditional sports teams, but the administration is now recruiting student athletes, and Corcoran has said he wants to establish fraternities and sororities, likely creating a culture clash with New College\u2019s artsy queer kids, activists and autodidacts. Before Wednesday\u2019s board meeting, about 75 people held a protest outside. \u201cWe\u2019re Nerds & Geeks, not Jocks & Greeks,\u201d said one sign.",
      "For many, the board of trustees meeting was the clearest sign yet that this is the last semester of New College as they know it. The pivot point was the trustees\u2019 decision to override the typical tenure process. New College hired a large number of new faculty five years ago, and this year was the first that any of them could apply for tenure. Seven did, each going through the requisite hurdles, including getting a sign-off from New College\u2019s former president. In the past, trustee approval had been a ceremonial matter, and tenure candidates would bring family and friends to celebrate.",
      "Corcoran, however, had asked all the professors up for tenure this year to withdraw their applications because of the tumult at the school. Two of the seven agreed. The rest \u2014 three of them professors in the hard sciences \u2014 held out for the board\u2019s vote. This was widely seen as a referendum not just on the individual candidates, but on faculty independence.",
      "Fifty-four people registered to speak at the meeting. All but one of them either implored the trustees to grant the professors tenure or lambasted them for their designs on the school. Parents were particularly impassioned; many of them had been profoundly relieved to find an affordable school where their eccentric kids could thrive. Some tried to speak the language of conservatism: \u201cYou\u2019re violating my parental rights regarding our school choice,\u201d said Pam Pare, the mother of a biology major. One student, a second-year wrapped in a pink and blue trans flag, was escorted out of the meeting after cursing at Corcoran, but most tried to earnestly and calmly convey how much the professors up for tenure had taught them.",
      "It was all futile. A majority of the trustees voted down each of the candidates in turn as the crowd chanted, \u201cShame on you!\u201d That\u2019s when Lepinski quit, walking out of the room to cheers.",
      "The trustees framed their objections in terms of timing; the professors were applying after five years at New College instead of the more customary six, and would have the opportunity to reapply the next year. But, given Rufo\u2019s plans, this explanation seemed like a pretext for an administration that wants to bring in its own, ideologically aligned faculty. And once denied tenure, it wasn\u2019t clear how many of the professors were going to stick around to try again.",
      "\u201cSome faculty members have started to leave already, and obviously some students are thinking about what their future looks like,\u201d Lepinski said right after quitting. A few days later, we spoke again. \u201cThere\u2019s a grieving process for the New College that was, which is passing away,\u201d he said. \u201cI really loved the New College that was, but I am at peace that it\u2019s gone now.\u201d",
      "Rufo couldn\u2019t attend Wednesday\u2019s meeting in person, because he\u2019d been delayed coming home from Hungary, where he had a fellowship at a right-wing think tank closely tied to Viktor Orban\u2019s government. (This seemed fitting, since Orban\u2019s Hungary created the ",
      " for Rufo and Desantis\u2019s educational crusade.) Instead, he Zoomed in, his face projected on a movie screen behind the other trustees.",
      "After Lepinski quit, Rufo ",
      " that \u201cany faculty that prefer the old system of unfettered left-wing activism and a rubber-stamp board are free to self-select out.\u201d Turnover, he added, \u201cis to be expected \u2014 even welcomed. But we are making rapid, significant progress.\u201d He and his allies haven\u2019t built anything new at New College yet. They are succeeding, however, in tearing something down."

      "A patient of mine once shared with me a most unusual story. He had worked for years in the food industry with a modest salary and humble lifestyle. Then he won the lottery. Overnight, his life changed. He quit his job and moved into a large house in a gated community.",
      "Yet as he sat across from me, he sadly declared, \u201cWinning the lottery was one of the worst things that ever happened to me.\u201d Wealthy but alone, this once vivacious, social man no longer knew his neighbors and had lost touch with his former co-workers. He soon developed high blood pressure and diabetes.",
      "I thought about his story in 2017 when I found myself struggling with loneliness. My first stint as surgeon general had just ended. I was suddenly disconnected from the colleagues with whom I had spent most of my waking hours. It might not have been so bad had I not made a critical mistake: I had largely neglected my friendships during my tenure, convincing myself that I had to focus on work and I couldn\u2019t do both.",

After my job ended, I felt ashamed to reach out to friends I had ignored. I found myself increasingly lonely and isolated, and it felt as if I was the only one who felt that way. Loneliness \u2014 like depression, with which it can be associated \u2014 can chip away at your self-esteem and erode your sense of who you are. That\u2019s what happened to me.",
      "At any moment, about one out of every two Americans ",
      " measurable ",
      ".This includes introverts and extroverts, rich and poor, and younger and older Americans. Sometimes loneliness is set off by the loss of a loved one or a job, a move to a new city, or health or financial difficulties \u2014 or a once-in-a-century pandemic.",
      "Other times, it\u2019s hard to know how it arose but it\u2019s simply there. One thing is clear: Nearly everyone experiences it at some point. But its invisibility is part of what makes it so insidious. We need to acknowledge the loneliness and isolation that millions are experiencing and the grave consequences for our mental health, physical health and collective well-being.",
      "This week, for the first time, I will be proposing a national framework to rebuild social connection and community in America. Loneliness is more than just a bad feeling. When people are socially disconnected, their risk of anxiety and depression increases. So does their risk of heart disease (29 percent), dementia (50 percent), and stroke (32 percent). The increased risk of premature death associated with social disconnection is comparable to smoking daily \u2014 and may be even greater than the risk associated with obesity.",
      "Loneliness and isolation hurt whole communities. Social disconnection is associated with reduced productivity in the workplace, worse performance in school, and diminished civic engagement. When we are less invested in one another, we are more susceptible to polarization and less able to pull together to face the challenges that we cannot solve alone \u2014 from climate change and gun violence to economic inequality and future pandemics. As it has built for decades, the epidemic of loneliness and isolation has fueled other problems that are killing us and threaten to rip our country apart.",
      "Given these extraordinary costs, rebuilding social connection must be a top public health priority for our nation. It will require reorienting ourselves, our communities, and our institutions to prioritize human connection and healthy relationships. The good news is we know how to do this.",
      "First, we must strengthen social infrastructure \u2014 the programs, policies, and structures that aid the development of healthy relationships. That means supporting school-based programs that teach children about building healthy relationships, workplace design that fosters social connection, and community programs that bring people together.",
      "Second, we have to renegotiate our relationship with technology, creating space in our lives without our devices so we can be more present with one another. That also means choosing not to take part in online dialogues that amplify judgment and hate instead of understanding.",
      "Finally, we have to take steps in our personal lives to rebuild our connection to one another \u2014 and small steps can make a big difference. This is medicine hiding in plain sight: Evidence shows that connection is linked to better heart health, brain health and immunity. It could be spending 15 minutes each day to reach out to people we care about, introducing ourselves to our neighbors, checking on co-workers who may be having a hard time, sitting down with people with different views to get to know and understand them, and seeking opportunities to serve others recognizing that helping people is one of the most powerful antidotes to loneliness.",
      "If loneliness and isolation have left you struggling with distressing feelings, reach out to someone supportive or your health care provider, and if it is a crisis, call 988. And if you go through significant social changes, be open with your health care provider about them, as this may help them understand and manage potential health effects.",
      "For me, it took more than a year of struggling with the pain and shame of loneliness, but I eventually found my footing. I didn\u2019t do it on my own. My mother, Myetraie; father, Hallegere; and sister, Rashmi, called me every day to remind me that they loved me for who I was. My wife, Alice, reminded me that the light she had seen in me when we first met was still there, even if I couldn\u2019t see it at times. And my friends Sunny and Dave committed to doing video conferences once a month and texting and talking weekly about the issues that weighed on our hearts and minds.",
      "During one of my lowest lows, the people in my life patched me up with their acts of love and connection. It is still a work in progress, but years later, in my second tenure in public service, I am making a much bigger effort to build and maintain my relationships. I am a better father, husband, friend and surgeon general as a result.",
      "Every generation is called to take on challenges that threaten the underpinnings of society. Addressing the crisis of loneliness and isolation is one of our generation\u2019s greatest challenges. By building more connected lives and more connected communities, we can strengthen the foundation of our individual and collective well-being and we can be better poised to respond to the threats we are facing as a nation.",
      "This work will take all of us: schools, workplaces, community organizations, government, health workers, public health professionals, individuals, families and more working together. And it will be worth it because our need for human connection is like our need for food and water: essential for our survival. The joy I felt being reconnected with my friends and family is possible for our nation.",

And that brings us back to O\u2019Hare Truck Service. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a 7-2 majority, quoted case law and reaffirmed a clear constitutional principle: \u201cIf the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited.\u201d",

      ". The findings starkly illustrate the misery that the burning of fossil fuels, mostly by wealthy countries, inflicts on societies that emit almost nothing by comparison.",
      "In parts of the nations hit hardest by the drought \u2014 Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia \u2014 climate hazards have piled on top of political and economic vulnerabilities. The region\u2019s string of weak rainy seasons is now the longest in around 70 years of reliable rainfall records. But according to the study, what has made this drought exceptional isn\u2019t just the poor rain, but the high temperatures that have parched the land.",
      "The study estimated that periods as hot and dry as the recent one now have a roughly 5 percent chance of developing each year in the region \u2014 a figure that is poised to rise as the planet continues to warm, said Joyce Kimutai, principal meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to see the combined effect of low precipitation with temperatures causing really exceptional droughts in this part of the world.\u201d",
      "Climate groups have for years pointed to the calamity in East Africa as evidence of the immense harm inflicted on poor regions by global warming from emissions of heat-trapping gases. The new analysis could give more ammunition to those urging polluter nations to pay for the economic damage attributable to their emissions.",
      "\u201cThis vital study shows that climate change is not just something our children need to worry about \u2014 it\u2019s already here,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank in Nairobi, Kenya. \u201cPeople on the front lines of the climate crisis need, and deserve, financial help to recover and rebuild their lives.\u201d",

      "The new analysis was conducted by Dr. Kimutai and 18 other researchers as part of World Weather Attribution, a scientific collaboration that tries to untangle the influence of human-induced climate change on specific heat waves, floods and other episodes of extreme weather. The study has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, though it relies on methods that are widely used and accepted by researchers.",
      "Scientists know that global warming is increasing the average likelihood and severity of certain kinds of wild weather in many regions. But to understand how it has affected a particular one-off event, they need to dig deeper. It\u2019s like smoking and cancer: The two are undeniably linked, but not all smokers develop cancer, and not all cancer patients were smokers. Each person is slightly different, and so is every weather event.",
      "To determine the effects of global warming on individual weather episodes, climate researchers use computer simulations to compare the global climate as it really is \u2014 with billions of tons of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere by humans over decades \u2014 and a hypothetical climate without any of those emissions.",
      "The authors of the new study examined the drought in East Africa by looking at data on average rainfall over 24 months and during both of the region\u2019s wet seasons, one between March and May and the other between October and December. Their mathematical models showed that climate change had made springtime rains as weak as the recent ones about twice as likely. The models also showed that climate change was having the opposite effect on the fall rainy seasons, making them wetter. And they indicated no effect on combined rainfall over two-year periods.",
      "A different picture emerged, however, when the researchers looked at both rainfall and evapotranspiration, or how much water leaves the soil because of warm temperatures. Their models showed that global warming had made combinations of high evapotranspiration and poor rainfall as severe as the recent spell at least 100 times as likely as they were before the Industrial Revolution.",
      "Scientists are getting a much better grasp on the atmospheric conditions that lead the rains to fail above the Horn of Africa, and on how global warming might be affecting them.",
      "In recent decades, when the Pacific Ocean has experienced ",
      " conditions, the trade winds strengthen and push warm water from the ocean\u2019s eastern end toward its western one. Heat builds up in the western equatorial Pacific around Indonesia, causing moist air to rise from the sea surface and form thunderstorms. This in turn affects the circulation of air above the Indian Ocean, which draws more moisture from the western end of that ocean toward the eastern end, and leaves less to fall as rain above the Horn of Africa.",
      "Climate change has been steadily heating up the surface of the western Pacific, which amplifies this sequence of events and increases the odds of poor rains in East Africa during La Ni\u00f1a periods.",
      "Improved scientific understanding has helped forecasters predict the recent weak rainfall in East Africa months in advance, said Chris Funk, a climate scientist and director of the Climate Hazards Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s light-years ahead of where we were in 2010 or 2016,\u201d he said, referring to years that preceded past droughts in the region.",
      "Policymakers in East Africa need to help communities become better equipped to recover from future droughts \u2014 for instance, by encouraging the use of drought-tolerant crops and livestock, said Phoebe Wafubwa Shikuku, an adviser in Nairobi with the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies. \u201cDrought will continue to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we have to look at, How do we address the various impacts"

For the past several years, as his robusta trees have succumbed to pests and disease, he has replaced them with Liberica trees. On his six acres Mr. John now has just 50 robustas, and 1,000 Libericas.",
      "He drinks it, too. He says it\u2019s more aromatic than robusta, \u201cmore tasteful.\u201d",
      "Catherine Kiwuka, a coffee specialist at the National Agricultural Research Organization, called Liberica excelsa \u201ca neglected coffee species.\u201d She is part of an experiment to introduce it to the world.",
      "If it works, it could hold important lessons for smallholder coffee farmers elsewhere, demonstrating the ",
      " in a warming world. Liberica excelsa is native to tropical Central Africa. It was cultivated for a little while in the late 19th century before petering out. Then came the ravages of climate change. Growers resurrected Liberica once more.",
      "\u201cWith climate change we ought to think about other species that can sustain this industry, globally,\u201d Dr. Kiwuka said.",
      "At the moment, the goal is to grow high-quality Liberica excelsa for export.",
      "Volcafe, a global coffee trading company, is hoping to ship up to three tons this year to specialty roasters abroad, including in Britain and the United States.",
      "While Arabica and robusta are the two widely cultivated species of coffee, more than 100 species grow in the wild. One Liberica variety has been farmed in Southeast Asia for a century.",
      "Another variety is Liberica excelsa, the one that is native to the lowlands of Uganda. Compared with robusta, which is also native to Uganda and the dominant coffee species grown in the region, Liberica takes longer to mature and produce fruit.",
      "Libericas tower over robustas. Each tree can grow to a height of eight meters, so farmers need to hoist themselves up on bamboo ladders to harvest them. Or else they need to prune the trees so their branches grow wide and not up.",
      "Around 200 farmers have been growing Liberica in small pockets, selling it to local traders together with their robusta harvest, and getting robusta prices. Dr. Kiwuka said she felt as though the farmers \u201cwere cheated.\u201d",
      "Liberica has a stronger aroma and is a higher quality coffee, she said; farmers should have been getting higher prices.",
      "In 2016, she invited Aaron Davis, a coffee scientist from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, England, to Zirobwe. He was skeptical at first. He had tasted Liberica elsewhere and found it to be like \u201cvegetable soup,\u201d he said.",

      ".",
      "Dr. Kiwuka and Dr. Davis teamed up. They would encourage farmers to improve the harvesting and drying of their Liberica crop. Instead of tossing them in with the robusta beans, they would sell the Libericas separately. If they met certain standards, they would get a higher price.",

      "Thankfully, he had another two acres of Liberica.",
      "How does Liberica excelsa taste when it\u2019s dried, hulled and roasted? Dr. Davis called it \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201ceasy drinking.\u201d It is heavy in aroma, lower in caffeine than robusta.",

      "It long seemed as though African elephants were the champions of the all-nighter. They can get by on about two hours of sleep. Other mammals need much more, like koalas (20 hours) or you (at least seven plus at least one strong cup of coffee).",
      "But the largest living mammals on land have some competition at sea. Northern elephant seals are also able to sustain themselves on about two hours\u2019 sleep, according to a ",
      " published Thursday in the journal Science. The study found that Northern elephant seals sleep far less at sea than they do on land, and the z\u2019s they do catch at sea are caught hundreds of feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. The study\u2019s authors believe that sleeping in the deep allows the seals to power-nap without being eaten by prowling predators.",
      "Northern elephant seals, which are found along the West Coast, are champion divers that can descend to depths of 2,500 feet and stay under for about two hours. They are not as big as elephants, but males can weigh as much as a car and stretch 13 feet long. To maintain their blubbery bulk, Northern elephant seals must spend around seven months at sea each year, gorging on fish and squid.",
      "During these epic voyages, the seals are vulnerable to predation by great white sharks and killer whales. Some marine mammals, such as dolphins and fur seals, can rest half of their brain at a time. This type of slumber, known as unihemispheric sleep, enables some mammals at sea to snooze with one eye open, literally, which prevents predators from catching them off guard. However, elephant seals sleep like us, shutting down their brains completely.",
      "Jessica Kendall-Bar, now a postdoctoral fellow at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, wondered how Northern \u200b\u200belephant seals managed to sleep, given how much time they need to spend eating and avoiding being eaten while at sea.",
      "To find out how elephant seals avoid waking up in the maw of an orca or a shark, Dr. Kendall-Bar worked with colleagues at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to design a device that could monitor the seals\u2019 brain waves, heart rates, dive depths and movement. The device is noninvasive and fits atop the seal\u2019s head like a swim cap. The team attached the devices to the heads of several seals and monitored their sleeping habits for five days. The data collected by the devices revealed a bedtime routine unlike any other.",
      "\u201cThey dive down, stop swimming and begin to glide,\u201d Dr. Kendall-Bar said.",
      "As they go deeper, their brain activity starts to slow.",
      "\u201cThen they transition to REM sleep, where they flip upside down and spin in a circle, falling like a leaf,\u201d she said.",
      "While in rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep, which is the deepest stage of sleep, the seals stayed upside down, oblivious to their slow descent.",
      "After sleeping for around 10 minutes, the seals would suddenly wake up and make their way back to the surface. During these sleep dives, some seals sank over 1,000 feet, sometimes finding themselves on the seafloor.",
      "The seals Dr. Kendall-Bar and her colleagues monitored took several sleep dives each day, providing them with around two hours of sleep in total. When Northern elephant seals haul out on land to breed and molt, they sleep for over ",
      ". During that time, the seals aren\u2019t eating, which may explain their need for extra sleep.",
      "\u201cSleep is an adaptive trait,\u201d said Jerome Siegel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the evolution and function of sleep. \u201cAnimals have evolved to sleep in certain situations and not in others.\u201d It makes perfect sense, Dr. Siegel said, that elephant seals would limit the amount of time they spend sleeping while at sea to make the most of their food intake and reduce the amount of time they are vulnerable to predators.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make seal sleep habits any less impressive.",
      "\u201cNorthern elephant seals exhibit unparalleled flexibility in their sleep duration,\u201d Dr. Kendall-Bar said. \u201cNo other mammal goes from sleeping about two hours a day for over 200 days to sleeping 10.8 hours a day.\u201d",
      "Dr. Kendall-Bar hopes her team\u2019s findings will aid in the protection of marine mammals.",

      ". Usually found growing in relatively poor soil, the plants sprout pitcher-shaped cups with pretty, frilly tops that obscure their true purpose: trapping hapless insects. Look inside the pitchers and you\u2019ll find the half-digested bodies of the plants\u2019 victims.",
      "How do insects wind up in this unenviable situation? Do they just, ",
      ", fall in by accident? While studies suggest that the plants\u2019 colors and its nectar may attract prey, some scientists think pitchers\u2019 scent may play a role as well.",
      "In a study published ",
      ", a research team identified odor molecules emanating from four types of pitcher plants and found that the scents seemed to be correlated with the kinds of insects that wound up in the pitchers. While the study is small and more work is needed to confirm the link, the findings suggest that when insects meet their deaths at the bottom of a pitcher, it may be an aroma they\u2019re following.",
      "Humans tend to describe a pitcher plants\u2019 scent as floral or herbal, said Laurence Gaume, a scientist the French National Centre for Scientific Research and an author of the new paper. Insects may find the scent more striking. ",
      " that pitchers emitting more volatile compounds tended to attract more flies, but rigorous examinations of what exactly pitchers release and whether it\u2019s connected to the insects they attract have been missing.",
      "To answer this question, Dr. Gaume and her colleagues grew four different types of Sarracenia",
      "pitcher plants at their research station in Montpelier, France. They sampled the air above 39 of the pitchers, identifying dozens of volatile compounds, and sliced a number of pitchers open to sort through their contents. They also measured the pitchers\u2019 width and depth, to see whether their shape contributed to the type of prey they caught.",
      "Pitchers with aromas that were heavy on monoterpenes, fragrant substances known to attract pollinators, seemed to catch more moths and bees, the group found, while those emitting more fatty acids ended up with more flies and ants. Pitcher shape, too, was correlated with certain kinds of prey: Longer pitchers were heavier on bees and moths, while shorter pitchers caught more ants.",
      "In other words, it seems unlikely that insects are just falling into a given pitcher by chance, Dr. Gaume said.",
      "Future experiments might probe whether pitcher scents painted onto fake plants draw insects\u2019 attention the same way, or whether altering pitcher color or shape affect the allure of the odors.",
      "Some of the pitcher plants used in Dr. Gaume and colleagues\u2019 research are native to North America \u2014 in fact, they can be found in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Dr. Gaume wonders whether the same connections between scents emitted and prey caught would show up in plants grown outside of the experimental conditions of the study. She has hopes of a much larger study in North America someday to further explore these findings, with row after row of sprightly death traps, all releasing come-hither odors into the air."

      "But scientists didn\u2019t just affix this device for laughs: They are curious about the underlying brain mechanisms that allow fish to navigate their world, and how such mechanisms relate to the evolutionary roots of navigation for all creatures with brain circuitry.",
      "\u201cNavigation is an extremely important aspect of behavior because we navigate to find food, to find shelter, to escape predators,\u201d said Ronen Segev, a neuroscientist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel who was part of a team that fitted 15 fish with cybernetic headgear for a study ",
      ".",
      "Putting a computer on a goldfish to study how the neurons fire in its brain while navigating wasn\u2019t easy.",
      "It takes a careful hand because a goldfish\u2019s brain, which looks a bit like a small cluster of lentils, is only half an inch long. \u201cUnder a microscope, we exposed the brain and put the electrodes inside,\u201d said Lear Cohen, a neuroscientist and doctoral candidate at Ben-Gurion who performed the surgeries to attach the devices. Each of those electrodes was the diameter of a strand of human hair.",
      "It was also tricky to find a way to perform the procedure on dry land without harming the test subject. \u201cThe fish needs water and you need him not to move,\u201d he said. He and his colleagues solved both problems by pumping water and anesthetics into the fish\u2019s mouth.",
      "Once the electrodes were in the brain, they were connected to a small recording device, which could monitor neuronal activity and which was sealed in a waterproof case, mounted on the fish\u2019s forehead. To keep the computer from weighing the fish down and impeding its ability to swim, the researchers attached buoyant plastic foam to the device.",
      "After recovering from surgery, the fish debuted their headgear in an experiment. The goldfish navigated a two-foot-long, six-inch-wide tank. The closer the fish swam to the tank\u2019s edges, the more the navigational cells in their brains lit up.",
      "The fish\u2019s brain-computer helped reveal that goldfish use a system of navigation that is subtly different from ",
      ". For humans (and other members of our class), navigational cells specialize in pinging our precise location within our environment and building a map around that spot. Mammals have specialized neurons that create these \u201cyou are here\u201d pins in their mental maps; the researchers didn\u2019t find those cells in fish.",
      "Instead, goldfish rely on a type of neuron that fires to let the animal know it is approaching a boundary or an obstacle. By combining the information about how far it is from various barriers, the fish is able to orient itself in space.",
      "The mammalian navigation system, Dr. Segev said, amounts to cells that let an animal determine \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here.\u201d In goldfish, he said, the cells work to impart a different message: \u201cI\u2019m in this position along this axis, and this position along a different axis.\u201d",
      "Mr. Cohen suspects that the variations in animals\u2019 navigation circuits may correspond to the different challenges they face getting around their habitats. For instance, he said, the ever-shifting currents of a watery home could mean that, for fish, \u201cit\u2019s easier to know the distance from a salient feature in the environment than knowing an exact position.\u201d",
      "All of the experiments were approved by the university\u2019s animal welfare committee and the researchers euthanized the fish after their swimming trials so they could further examine their brains. The team hopes to continue learning how and why fish\u2019s navigational systems differ from ours.",
      "Adelaide Sibeaux, a biologist at Oxford University who was not involved with the study, said she found the project \u201cpretty amazing\u201d as well as important.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re modifying a lot of animals\u2019 environments, and, if you understand how an animal navigates, you will know if they are able to cope with changes that are happening in the world at the moment,\u201d Dr. Sibeaux said; for fish, that could include water that becomes murkier because of pollution."

      " a kiddie pool with a level of wild enthusiasm rivaling the most committed human dancer at an all-night rave.",
      "Humans\u2019 love of spinning around in circles, especially during childhood, is evidenced by the enduring popularity of playground merry-go-rounds, revolving fun park rides and the irresistible draw of somersaulting down a hill. But new research suggests that humans are not alone in their pursuit of spin-induced buzzes.",
      "According to findings ",
      ", other great ape species also seem to regularly enjoy stimulating their senses through spinning, possibly even in pursuit of altered mental states.",
      "\u201cSpinning around to make ourselves dizzy is something we usually think of as a distinctly human activity,\u201d said Marcus Perlman, a cognitive scientist at the University of Birmingham in England and an author of the study. \u201cSo it\u2019s really cool to find that other primates do this, too, and that they seem to do it for the same reason that children do: because it\u2019s fun and exhilarating.\u201d",
      "After Dr. Perlman saw the videos of Zola, he turned to YouTube to investigate whether other apes engaged in the behavior. He amassed nearly 400 videos showing great apes and other primates engaged in spinning behaviors, including somersaulting, rolling down hills, backflipping and pirouetting. But the new paper focuses on clips of apes spinning on ropes or ropelike materials.",
      "Dr. Perlman and Adriano Lameira, a primatologist and evolutionary psychologist at the University of Warwick in England, found 132 instances of rope-spinning across 40 videos involving orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. The videos mostly featured captive apes, but several involved wild mountain gorillas on vines.",
      "The researchers calculated the speed at which the apes spun. Most of the apes, they found, spun at an average rotation velocity of 1.43 revolutions per second \u2014 a speed rivaling professionally trained human dancers and aerialists. The longest spin session lasted 28 revolutions, and the fastest \u2014 achieved by a bonobo \u2014 clocked in at a brain-scrambling four revolutions per second.",
      "The researchers observed that the longer an ape spun, the more likely it was to show signs of dizziness, such as letting go of the rope and immediately sitting or lying down. Apes tended to repeat the process of spinning and stopping, engaging in an average of three bouts of spinning per session.",
      "The animals also often made \u201cplay faces\u201d while spinning, Dr. Perlman said, implying that they were most likely having fun rather than only seeking a way to relieve themselves of boredom in captivity.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the experience they enjoy,\u201d Dr. Perlman said.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who was not involved in the research, concurred. Based on her observations in the field, she said, \u201cwild apes love to spin.\u201d",

      "Moths and other insects are drawn to lights at night as reliably as planets orbit stars.",
      "Entomologists have long exploited this fact by setting out light traps whenever they want to collect insects. Poets have reached for the image of a moth drawn to flame to signify self-destructive behavior in works ranging from \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d",
      "to the Hindu epic the Bhagavad Gita",
      "Ecologists, more recently, ",
      " that the lure of artificial lights across Earth\u2019s nighttime surface may partially explain why insects are in global decline.",
      "But, despite all this, scientists still didn\u2019t know why.",
      "\u201cA lot of entomologists get asked this all the time,\u201d Avalon Owens, a biologist at Harvard, said.",
      "One prevailing theory, popular but flawed, she said, is that flying insects confuse our porch lights for the moon or another celestial body, and their sense of navigation gets scrambled. Another idea is that lights at night look like glimpses of daylight through a thicket of vegetation, prompting insects to try to \u201cescape\u201d by making a beeline toward what they think is open space.",
      "Now, though, ",
      " has the entomology world abuzz. A team led by biologists Samuel Fabian at Imperial College London and Yash Sondhi at Florida International University argue that when many insects see a bright light at night, they believe they\u2019ve found the direction of the sky and attempt to orient themselves along an up-and-down axis. That instinct prompts them to roll their backs toward the light, mistakenly in cases when the source of illumination is on the ground or mounted horizontally, causing them to go into endless, banking turns like a tiny airplane or to crash-land.",
      "The findings were published in a paper that was uploaded to the bioRxiv server but has yet to be peer-reviewed.",
      "In the daytime, entomologists knew, such directional instincts help flying insects stay level by keeping their backs pointed toward sunlight, even during aerial maneuvers. The new analysis, though, shows that lights at night appear to hijack this instinct.",
      "To arrive at this conclusion, the scientists took high-speed, lowlight video of dragonflies, butterflies and moths flying around light bulbs both in the lab and in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. Sometimes the insects would start making circular loops like an orbiting moon. Other times the insects would pass the bulbs, then tilt upward into a stall. Or they would fly above the bulbs, then flip themselves upside down and nose-dive toward the ground.",
      "In each case, though, the slowed-down footage showed that the insects always tried to keep their backs aimed toward the light, a result the team confirmed by gluing little motion trackers on the insects. In turn, the team found through computerized flight simulations that those inadvertent roll maneuvers could explain the bugs\u2019 looping, trapped flight trajectories.",
      "\u201cThis is the best argument so far for what explains this behavior,\u201d said Tyson Hedrick, an expert in the aerodynamics of insect flight at the University of North Carolina who said he had previously favored the idea that lights interfere with the celestial navigation of insects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of these things that we all sort of think we know about nature,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s getting overturned.\u201d",
      "The new study also offers a hint of how to mitigate the effect, which can kill insects in ways that are poetic \u2014 burning up in flame \u2014 or more sinister, like getting trapped in the web of a spider that has learned artificial lights provide prey. Some insects also simply run out of calories by flying in circles.",
      "The research team found that insects seem least affected when they fly under lights that are projected straight down, as opposed to lights that shine upward or that have been mounted horizontally. This finding dovetails with longstanding advice from researchers to limit light pollution by using downward pointing light fixtures that illuminate only the nearby ground.",
      "Aside from beckoning insects, lights can also interfere with the development of caterpillars, cause fireflies to stop flashing, and shrink the habitat of shyer nocturnal species that venture out only in pure darkness, Dr. Owens said.",
      "\u201cThe most effective way of solving this problem is always going to be turning off the lights,\u201d she said."

      " tightly wound inside most of our cells. Today, scientists are still struggling to decipher it.",

      " published in Science on Thursday has cast a bright light into the dark recesses of the human genome by comparing it with those of 239 other mammals, including narwhals, cheetahs and ",
      ".",
      "By tracing this genomic evolution over the past 100 million years, the so-called ",
      " has revealed millions of stretches of human DNA that have changed little since our shrew-like ancestors scurried in the shadows of dinosaurs. These ancient genetic elements most likely carry out essential functions in our bodies today, the project found, and mutations within them can put us at risk of a range of diseases.",
      "The project\u2019s strength lies in the huge amount of data analyzed \u2014 not just the genomes, but experiments on thousands of pieces of DNA and information from medical studies, said Alexander Palazzo, a geneticist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the work. \u201cThis is the way it needs to be done.\u201d",
      "The mammalian genomes also allowed the Zoonomia team to pinpoint pieces of human DNA with radical mutations that set them apart from other mammals. Some of these genetic adaptations may have had a major role in the evolution of our big, complex brains.",
      "The researchers have only scraped the surface of potential revelations in their database. Other researchers say it will serve as a treasure map to guide further explorations of the human genome.",
      "\u201cEvolution\u2019s crucible sees all,\u201d said Jay Shendure, a geneticist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the project.",
      "Scientists have long known that just a tiny fraction of our DNA contains so-called protein-coding genes, which make crucial proteins like digestive enzymes in our stomach, collagen in our skin and hemoglobin in our blood. All of our 20,000 protein-coding genes make up just 1.5 percent of our genome. The other 98.5 percent is ",
      ".",
      "Scientists have found that some bits of that inscrutable DNA help determine which proteins get made at certain places and at certain times. Other pieces of DNA act like switches, turning on nearby genes. And still others can amplify the production of those genes. And still others act like off switches.",
      "Through painstaking experiments, scientists have uncovered thousands of these switches nestled in long stretches of DNA that seem to do nothing for us \u2014 what some biologists call \u201cjunk DNA.\u201d Our genome contains thousands of broken copies of ",
      ", for example, and vestiges of ",
      " of our distant ancestors.",
      "But it\u2019s not yet possible for scientists to look directly at the human genome and identify all the switches. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the language that makes these things work,\u201d said Steven Reilly, a geneticist at the Yale School of Medicine and one of more than 100 members of the Zoonomia team.",
      "When the project began over a decade ago",
      " the researchers recognized that evolution could help them decipher this language. They reasoned that switches that endure for millions of years are probably essential to our survival.",
      "In every generation, mutations randomly strike the DNA of every species. If they hit a piece of DNA that isn\u2019t essential, they will cause no harm and may be passed down to future generations.",
      "Mutations that destroy an essential switch, on the other hand, probably won\u2019t get passed down. They may instead kill a mammal, such as by turning off genes essential for organ development. \u201cYou just won\u2019t get a kidney,\u201d said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and Uppsala University who initiated the Zoonomia Project.",
      "Dr. Lindblad-Toh and her colleagues determined that they would need to compare more than 200 mammal genomes to track these mutations over the past 100 million years. They collaborated with wildlife biologists to get tissue from species spread out across the mammalian evolutionary tree.",
      "The scientists worked out the sequence of genetic letters \u2014 known as bases \u2014 in each genome, and compared them with the sequences of other species to determine how mutations arose in different mammalian branches as they evolved from a common ancestor.",
      "\u201cIt took a lot of computer churn,\u201d said Katherine Pollard, a data scientist at Gladstone Institutes who helped build the Zoonomia database.",
      "The researchers found that a relatively small number of bases in the human genome \u2014 330 million, or ",
      " \u2014 gained few mutations in any branch of the mammalian tree, a sign that they were essential to the survival of all of these species, including our own.",
      "Our genes make up a small portion of that 10.7 percent. The rest lies outside our genes, and probably includes elements that turn genes on and off.",
      "Mutations in these little-changed parts of the genome were harmful for millions of years, and they remain harmful to us today, the researchers found. ",
      " typically alter bases that the researchers found had evolved little in the past 100 million years.",
      "Nicky Whiffin, a geneticist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the project, said that clinical geneticists struggle to find disease-causing mutations outside of protein-coding genes.",
      "Dr. Whiffin said the Zoonomia Project could guide geneticists to unexplored regions of the genome with health relevance. \u201cThat could massively narrow down the number of variants you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "The DNA that governs our essential biology has changed remarkably little over the past 100 million years. But of course, we are not identical to kangaroo rats or blue whales. The Zoonomia Project is allowing researchers to pinpoint mutations in the human genome that help make us unique.",
      "Dr. Pollard is focused on thousands of stretches of DNA that have not changed over that period of time \u2014 except in our own species. Intriguingly, many of these pieces of fast-evolving DNA are active in the developing human brain.",
      "Based on the new data, Dr. Pollard and her colleagues think they now understand how our species broke with 100 million years of tradition. In many cases, the first step was a mutation that accidentally created an extra copy of a long stretch of DNA. By making our DNA longer, this mutation ",
      ".",
      "As our DNA refolded, a genetic switch that once controlled a nearby gene no longer made contact with it. Instead, it now made contact with a new one. The switch eventually gained mutations allowing it to control its new neighbor. Dr. Pollard\u2019s research suggests that some of these shifts helped human brain cells grow for a longer period of time during childhood \u2014 a crucial step in the evolution of our large, powerful brains.",
      "Dr. Reilly, of Yale, has found other mutations that might have also helped our species build a more powerful brain: those that accidentally ",
      ".",
      "Scanning the Zoonomia genomes, Dr. Reilly and his colleagues looked for DNA that survived in species after species \u2014 but were then deleted in humans. They found 10,000 of these deletions. Most were just a few bases long, but some of them had profound effects on our species.",
      "One of the most striking deletions altered an off switch in the human genome. It is near a gene called LOXL2, which is active in the developing brain. Our ancestors lost just one base of DNA from the switch. That tiny change turned the off switch into an on switch.",
      "Dr. Reilly and his researchers ran experiments to see how the human version of LOXL2 behaved in neurons compared with the standard mammalian version. Their experiments suggest that LOXL2 stays active in children longer than it does in young apes. LOXL2 is known to keep neurons in a state where they can keep growing and sprouting branches. So staying switched on longer in childhood could allow our brains to grow more than ape brains.",
      "\u201cIt changes our idea of how evolution can work\u201d Dr. Reilly said. \u201cBreaking stuff in your genome can lead to new functions.\u201d",
      "The Zoonomia Project team has plans to add more mammalian genomes to their comparative database. Zhiping Weng, a computational biologist at UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, is particularly eager to look at 250 additional species of primates.",
      " suggests that virus-like pieces of DNA multiplied in the genomes of our monkey-like ancestors, inserting new copies of themselves and rewiring our on-off switches in the process. Comparing more primate genomes will let Dr. Weng get a clearer picture of how those changes may have rewired our genome.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still very obsessed with being a human,\u201d she said."

      "A new study of genetic data from a market in Wuhan, China, said the data did not support the case that the pandemic had started with illegally traded animals, touching off fresh debate about samples that other scientists see as critical pieces of the puzzle of how the coronavirus reached humans.",
      "The ",
      ", which examined the relative amounts of animal and viral material in swabs taken from surfaces at the market in early 2020, said it was difficult to draw conclusions about whether given samples of the virus had come from infected live animals or were simply from incidental contamination.",
      "But several outside experts said the analysis, posted online this week by the study\u2019s author, Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, could have been affected by a number of unknown variables and decisions about how to filter the data.",
      "For those reasons, they said, the findings did not do much to sway their impression of previous studies. Samples from the market containing animal and viral genetic material, they said, were consistent with the possibility that an animal there \u2014 perhaps a raccoon dog \u2014 had spread the virus to people, but did not prove that had happened.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty reasonable chance they picked up an infected raccoon dog, but that doesn\u2019t prove that was the origin,\u201d said Frederic Bushman, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in analyzing samples like those taken from the Wuhan market, but who was not involved in any of the market studies. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Bloom paper changes my thinking that much.\u201d",
      "Chinese researchers ",
      " last year and then made the genetic sequences available this year, allowing a team of international scientists to study them. That team ",
      " last month that based on the data, they could not conclusively identify an animal that had passed the virus to people.",
      "But they said the data confirmed that animals believed to be susceptible to the virus, like raccoon dogs and masked palm civets, a small Asian mammal implicated in the SARS outbreak two decades ago, were being sold at the market in late 2019. Many of the earliest Covid-19 patients also worked or shopped at the market.",
      "Because the market was one of only four places in Wuhan reported to be selling live animals of the sort that could plausibly spread the virus, the scientists said it was unlikely that so many early patients were linked to the market purely by chance. They said the genetic data also built on other evidence, including that two early lineages of the virus had been at the market.",
      "This week\u2019s study took a different approach to analyzing the gene sequences.",
      "Dr. Bloom investigated whether the amount of genetic material from the virus correlated with the amount of genetic material from susceptible animal species in the samples. If one species at the market was overwhelmingly responsible for shedding the virus, he said\u00a0in an interview, he would have expected to see a clear link between the amount of genetic material from the virus and the amount from that species.",
      "But the study found no clear correlations\u00a0of that kind. Instead, the strongest correlations involved various fish sold at the market that could not have been infected, an indication that infected people had probably deposited viral material where the fish was.",
      "Dr. Bloom said that finding suggested that the virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, was spread widely across the market by the time the swabs were collected in early 2020.",
      "\u201cIn the same way we shouldn\u2019t read much of anything into the fact that there\u2019s a bunch of SARS-CoV-2 mixed with largemouth bass and catfish samples, we also shouldn\u2019t read much into the fact that there\u2019s a raccoon dog sample with a SARS-CoV-2 read,\u201d Dr. Bloom said.",
      "But outside experts said that various features of the samples could throw off efforts to correlate animal and viral material. The international scientists said in their report that they had considered running a similar analysis, but that it risked producing misleading results. Dr. Bloom acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s an open question of whether that is an informative thing to calculate at all.\u201d",
      "Genetic material from the virus degrades quickly, said Christopher Mason, a specialist in environmental sampling at Weill Cornell Medicine. Crucially, viral material may decay at a different rate than material from animals, making it difficult to compare them in samples collected over the course of weeks after the market\u2019s closure.",
      "It could be that fish were most closely associated with the virus simply because the fish were likely to have been frozen or refrigerated, slowing the decay of viral material in those samples, said Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist at KU Leuven in Belgium.",
      "The latest analysis \u201cconfirms that looking at these sorts of correlations tells you next to nothing with respect to which host species could have been a plausible source of the pandemic,\u201d Dr. Wenseleers said. This leaves scientists in the same situation as before, he said, with market data that doesn\u2019t offer conclusive evidence of any particular origin scenario.",
      "The new study also looked closely at a swab from a cart at the market in which the international team had found a\u00a0trace\u00a0of the virus alongside genetic signatures of raccoon dogs, but no detectable genetic material from humans.",
      "Dr. Bloom wrote that the swab had only a minuscule amount of viral material, and that it was not clear why Chinese researchers had classified the swab as Covid-positive. His study said that swab was the only one that had substantial amounts of raccoon dog genetic material with any traces of the virus.",
      "Some scientists, though, said Dr. Bloom\u2019s analysis risked dismissing other Covid-positive swabs by setting too high of a bar for the amount of animal genetic material in a sample.",
      "Dr. Bushman, of the University of Pennsylvania, said that the threshold used in the analysis was \u201caggressive\u201d and that it was best to compare results obtained from a series of different cutoffs.",
      "Using a more sensitive threshold, the international team of scientists identified multiple\u00a0Covid-positive samples containing raccoon dog genetic material, as well as others with genetic signatures of different\u00a0animals\u00a0thought to be susceptible to the virus.",
      "Alexander Crits-Christoph, a computational biologist formerly at Johns Hopkins University who helped lead the international team\u2019s analysis, said the team also looked closely at whether the Chinese researchers had been right to describe the swab from the cart as positive for the virus.",
      "He noted that a number of other swabs from the same stall were clearly positive for the virus. He said results from sampling elsewhere in the market also indicated that unlike the swab from the cart, most of the truly negative swabs contained no traces of the virus at all.",

      "The United States is wiring Ukraine with sensors that can detect\u200c\u200c bursts of radiation from a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb and can confirm the identity of the attacker.",
      "In part, the goal is to make sure that if Russia detonates a radioactive weapon on Ukrainian soil, its atomic signature and Moscow\u2019s culpability could be verified.",
      "Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine 14 months ago, experts have worried about whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ",
      " for the first time since the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The preparations, mentioned last month in a House hearing and detailed Wednesday by the National Nuclear Security Administration, a federal agency that is part of the Energy Department, seem to constitute the hardest evidence to date that Washington is taking concrete steps to prepare for the worst possible outcomes of the invasion of Ukraine, Europe\u2019s second largest nation.",

      "That statement goes to the fog of nuclear war and how the United States could use the new system to pierce it.",
      "In one scenario, Washington could use information gathered by the network to rule out the possibility of misidentifying the attacker who set off a nuclear blast. That might seem like an unnecessary step given the distinctiveness of a mushroom cloud. But if a weapon was delivered by a truck, tank or boat instead of a conspicuous missile with a trackable flight path, figuring out its origins might prove near impossible.",

      "Earlier this year, astronomers announced that a tiny world beyond Neptune with a diameter about one-third that of Earth\u2019s moon possessed a Saturn-like ring that should not be there. It now turns out that there are two such \u201cimpossible\u201d rings.",
      "\u201cIt was a big surprise,\u201d said Chrystian Luciano Pereira, a doctoral student at the National Observatory in Brazil who led the observations of the world, known as Quaoar. \u201cThis implies that Quaoar is a more complex system than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The new ring, about six miles wide, encircles Quaoar at a distance of about 1,500 miles. The discovery ",
      " in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters.",
      "Scientists still do not fully understand how dust and gas in the early solar system coalesced into moons and planets.",
      "Like the ",
      ", announced by a team of astronomers in February, the second ring lies beyond what is known as the Roche limit. Material orbiting closer than this distance tends to be pulled apart by tidal forces. Thus, a ring within the Roche limit would tend to remain a ring, while a ring of debris outside the Roche limit would usually coalesce into a moon.",
      "For Quaoar, the Roche limit is calculated to be 1,100 miles. The second ring, at a distance of 1,500 miles from the center of Quaoar, is closer than the ring announced in February, which has a radius of about 2,500 miles.",
      "Quaoar (pronounced KWA-wahr, and the name of the creator god for the Indigenous Tongva people who live around Los Angeles) orbits the sun in the ",
      " a region of frozen debris beyond Neptune that includes Pluto.",
      "The ring is not visible in telescope images. Rather, astronomers found it indirectly, when distant stars happened to pass behind Quaoar, blocking the starlight. From 2018 to 2021, Quaoar passed in front of four stars, and astronomers on Earth were able to observe the shadow of the eclipses, also known as stellar occultations.",
      "They also observed some dimming of the starlight before and after the star blinked out, which pointed to the existence of the first ring.",
      "Another occultation occurred on Aug. 9 last year, and astronomers again pointed telescopes, large and small, at Quaoar in hopes of learning more about the ring.",
      "The new observations revealed more details including a dense, narrow core in the ring just a few miles wide, which is surrounded by an envelope of material that is more dispersed. The observations also revealed the second ring.",
      "Another occultation will occur on May 13, visible to telescopes in the United States and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis event involves a bright star and will be useful to constrain the Quaoar shape better, in addition to being a good opportunity to obtain more details about these two remarkable rings,\u201d Mr. Pereira said.",
      "A potential explanation for Quaoar\u2019s distant rings is the presence of a moon, Weywot. The moon may have created gravitational disturbances that prevented the ring\u2019s particles from accreting into additional moons. Both rings occur in locations near what are known as resonances with Weywot, and the resonances may turn out to be more important than the Roche limit for determining whether rings turn into moons or remain as rings."

      "Like basketball scouts discovering a nimble, super-tall teenager, astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope reported recently that they had identified a small, captivating group of baby galaxies near the dawn of time. These galaxies, the scientists say, could well grow into one of the biggest conglomerations of mass in the universe, a vast cluster of thousands of galaxies and trillions of stars.",
      "The seven galaxies\u00a0they identified\u00a0date to a moment 13 billion years ago, just 650 million years after the Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis could indeed have been the most massive system in the entire universe at the time,\u201d said Takahiro Morishita, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology\u2019s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center. He described the proto-cluster as the most distant and thus earliest such entity yet observed. Dr. Morishita was the lead author of a report on the discovery, which was published ",
      ".",
      "The\u00a0scientists\u2019 report is an outgrowth of a larger effort known as the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space, organized by Tommaso Treu, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles, to harvest early science results from the Webb telescope.",
      "The telescope was launched into orbit around the sun on Christmas Day in 2021. With its infrared detectors and a booming primary mirror 21 feet wide, it is ideal for investigating the early years of the universe. As the universe expands, galaxies that are so distant in space and time are racing away from Earth so fast that most of their visible light, and the information about them, has been stretched into invisible infrared wavelengths, like receding sirens lowering in pitch.",
      "In its first year, the Webb has already recovered a bounty of bright galaxies and big black holes that formed only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.",
      "The latest infant galaxies had been detected over the years by the Hubble Space Telescope as red dots of light, visible at such great remove only because they had been magnified by the space-warping gravity of Pandora\u2019s Cluster, an intervening cluster of galaxies in the constellation Sculptor.",
      "Spectroscopic measurements with the Webb telescope confirmed that the seven dots were galaxies and were all equally far from Earth. They occupy a region of space 400,000 light-years across, or about one-sixth the distance from here to the Milky Way galaxy\u2019s nearest cousin, the great spiral galaxy Andromeda.",
      "\u201cSo, our efforts of following up on the formerly known potential proto-cluster finally paid off after almost 10 years!\u201d Dr. Morishita wrote.",
      "According to calculations based on prevailing models of the universe, gravity will eventually draw these galaxies together into a massive cluster containing at least a trillion stars. \u201cWe can see these distant galaxies like small drops of water in different rivers, and we can see that eventually they will all become part of one big, mighty river,\u201d said Benedetta Vulcani of the National Institute of Astrophysics in Italy and a member of the research group.",
      "The spectroscopic data also allowed Dr. Morishita and his colleagues to determine that the stars populating some of these embryonic galaxies were surprisingly mature, containing sizable amounts of elements like oxygen and iron, which would have had to have been forged in the nuclear furnaces of generations of earlier stars. Others among the infant galaxies were more pristine. In theory, the very first stars in the universe would have been composed of pure hydrogen and helium, the first elements to emerge from the Big Bang.",
      "Some of these galaxies were birthing stars at a prodigious rate, more than 10 times as fast as the Milky Way, which is 10 to 100 times as big. Others in the young group were barely generating one star a year, \u201cwhich is an interesting diversity in a group of galaxies at this early epoch,\u201d Dr. Morishita said.",
      "All this adds to a suspicion among some cosmologists that the early universe was producing stars, galaxies and black holes much faster than the standard theory predicts. In an email, Dr. Morishita said there was not yet any \u201ccrisis\u201d in cosmology.",
      "\u201cThe easier explanation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that our prior understanding of star formation and dust production in the early universe, which are complex phenomena, was incomplete.\u201d"

However, the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates rocket launches, is investigating the events of the first launch and will have to be satisfied with SpaceX\u2019s adjustments and improvements before allowing another Starship flight.",

He said he expected four or five more Starship launches this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably got an 80 percent probability of reaching orbit this year,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tempt fate, but I think close to 100 percent chance of reaching orbit within 12 months.\u201d",

      "Called \u201cThe Conquest of Pestilence in New York City,\u201d it showed how strides in public health eventually quelled the epidemics of the 19th century. For the last century or so, the death rate \u2014 measured as the number of deaths per 1,000 residents \u2014 was relatively flat or declining, until the pandemic\u2019s disastrous first wave in early 2020.",
      "The spike in the city\u2019s\u00a0death rate in 2020 looks like something \u201cfrom a different era,\u201d the city\u2019s health commissioner, Dr. Ashwin Vasan, said in an interview. \u201cWhen you see this spike, there is a sense of \u2018Have we gone backwards?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 2019, the city logged six deaths per 1,000 residents, which jumped to more than nine deaths per 1,000 residents in 2020, a stunning increase of about 50 percent that has happened only a few times before. Further back in history, the typical\u00a0death rate was far higher.",
      "Throughout the 19th century, even during years without epidemics, the death rate was about 25 deaths per 1,000 people. That is about four times as high as it was in modern day New York just before the pandemic.",
      "But by the start of the 20th century, the death rate began dropping precipitously. Another significant drop in the death rate occurred over the last 30 years or so, attributable to a drop in smoking, the introduction of effective H.I.V. medication, and a range of other advances.",
      "The health department\u2019s calculations conclude that Covid-19 killed 241.3 people per 100,000 New Yorkers, while the 1918 influenza pandemic \u2014 the most severe pandemic of the 20th century \u2014 killed 228.9 people per 100,000.",
      "Covid-19 tended to kill the old, while the 1918 flu was unusually deadly for adults under 40.",
      "In addition, the death toll for influenza in 1918 seen in the \u201cConquest\u201d chart\u00a0and used in the\u00a0health department\u2019s death rate calculations may involve a dramatic undercount. Back then, the health department often distinguished between deaths from the initial influenza infection and the bacterial pneumonia that often followed. The health department\u2019s calculations\u00a0comparing 1918 to 2020 appear to only include the first category.",
      "The 4.6-year-drop in life expectancy across the city was also profound.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty dramatic decline in a short amount of time,\u201d Dr. Vasan said.",
      "Covid no longer poses the same deadly threat it did in 2020, but Dr. Vasan said he is worried that life expectancy won\u2019t rise back to prepandemic levels for years to come. The pandemic has had a \u201cripple effect\u201d as chronic diseases, ",
      " ",
      ", have gone unmanaged for many people, he said. Drug overdoses have increased. ",
      "The drop in life expectancy was not felt evenly. For white New Yorkers, the average life expectancy dropped by three years to 80.1, while the life expectancy of Black New Yorkers dropped about five years to 73 years. For Hispanic New Yorkers, the drop was 6 years, to 77.3 years. (Asian New Yorkers were not included in the analysis because of data issues.)",
      "This is partly explained by the fact that white New Yorkers ",
      " during the deadly first wave in the spring of 2020, and tended to have lower rates of some of the chronic diseases \u2014 such as diabetes, hypertension or kidney disease \u2014 that raise the risk of dying from Covid-19.",
      " were also starkly illuminated by data depicting the leading causes of premature death \u2014 that is, deaths of people under 65. For Hispanic, Asian and Black New Yorkers in 2020, Covid-19 was the leading cause of premature death.",
      "But it did not register in 2020 as even the first or even second cause of premature deaths among white New Yorkers. Those continued to be cancer and heart disease.",
      " In Brownsville, Brooklyn \u2014 an impoverished and predominately Black neighborhood with a high concentration of public housing developments \u2014 the premature death rate was nine times as high as in Greenwich Village and SoHo, predominantly white and wealthy Manhattan neighborhoods.",
      "When adjusted for age, the premature mortality rate in 2020 of Hispanic New Yorkers increased by 73 percent, by 56 percent for Asian New Yorkers, by 50 percent for Black New Yorkers and by 21 percent for white New Yorkers.",
      "Covid caused most of the loss in life expectancy in 2020, but not all of it.",
      "\u201cYou obviously see Covid as the principal driver, but that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story,\u201d Dr. Vasan said.",
      "Many ",
      " when Covid-19 arrived. Deaths from heart disease, for instance, were nearly 20 percent higher in 2020 than the year before.",
      "To a limited degree, the pandemic scrambled the trends of causes of death in modern New York. Diabetes, for instance, climbed in the rankings as a cause of death, as did drug overdoses, while influenza fell.",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning of us understanding this data,\u201d said Dr. Gretchen Van Wye, the department\u2019s deputy commissioner for epidemiology. \u201cThis is just the beginning of many people studying this for a long time to really understand what happened.\u201d"

      "People infected with the coronavirus were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes within a year of their infection, compared with those who had not been exposed to the virus, researchers in Canada reported on Tuesday.",

      "People who were admitted to intensive care were more than three times as likely to develop diabetes, the researchers also found. The findings add to a growing body of evidence about Covid\u2019s long-term effects.",

      "Covid vaccines became available in December 2020, and a majority of participants in both the exposed and unexposed groups had not been fully vaccinated.",
      "More than a dozen studies have looked at the link between Covid and diabetes, and a majority have reported an increase in diagnosis following infection, as well as higher risks for men and those with severe disease.",
      "The findings do not prove that the infection causes diabetes, however. Experts said it was possible, for instance, that patients recovering from Covid were more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes simply because they were receiving more regular care.",
      "Still, there are plausible biological explanations for a link between the two conditions, said Dr. Pamela Davis, a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, who ",

      "\u201cBut even if it\u2019s just an acceleration, this is going to be costly,\u201d she added. \u201cThe human suffering, the risk of complications in the eyes, the blood vessels, the heart, the kidneys, the days of productivity and work lost \u2014 all those things will be accelerated. I\u2019m worried about this.\u201d",
      "The coronavirus infects beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin, Dr. Davis said, and cause cell death. These cells are dotted with the ACE2 receptors that the virus uses as an entryway.",
      "\u201cIf you put the beta cells of the pancreas in a culture dish, the virus will avidly infect these cells and destroy them,\u201d she said.",
      "Stress also plays a role in the development of diabetes, and the inflammatory response that accompanies Covid has been linked to the destruction of beta cells. People with severe Covid may also produce antibodies that attack the patient\u2019s own body.",
      "Other viral infections have also been associated with the development of diabetes, according to Dr. Janjua, whose research before the pandemic focused on hepatitis.",
      "\u201cWith hepatitis C, we have strong evidence that the infection is associated with an increased risk of diabetes as well as cardiovascular outcomes and many other systemic outcomes outside the liver as well,\u201d Dr. Janjua said.",
      "The new study found that adults who had tested positive for the virus were 17 percent more likely to develop diabetes within a year of the positive test. Men were 22 percent more likely to develop diabetes, compared with unexposed individuals. The elevated risk for women was not statistically significant overall unless they were hospitalized or admitted to an intensive care unit.",
      "The researchers matched infected and unexposed people by age and sex, and made adjustments to account for differences in underlying health conditions, socioeconomic status, vaccination status and other factors.",
      "They calculated that of all new cases of diabetes, some 3.4 percent could be attributed to a Covid infection. For men, 4.75 percent of new cases were attributed to Covid."

Those who are unvaccinated can get a single dose of the bivalent booster, the agency said.",

Eligible Americans will be able to receive booster doses immediately.",

And instead of needing an initial series of two shots, unvaccinated people will now require just a single dose of the reformulated, or \u201cbivalent,\u201d Covid shot to be considered vaccinated.",

      "The bivalent vaccine targets the original variant of the coronavirus as well as variants BA.4 and BA.5, which were dominant last summer. But BA.4 and BA.5 were quickly supplanted by newer versions.",

The rationale is that most unvaccinated Americans now presumably have some measure of immunity from a prior infection and may not need two doses at the beginning, the F.D.A. said.",
      "Some experts were sharply critical of the advice. Reams of data suggest that the vaccines are most protective when given in two doses and followed by one or more boosters to reinforce the shield, said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College.",
      "\u201cF.D.A. has consistently over-interpreted the performance of the bivalent formulation when given as a booster,\u201d Dr. Moore said. \u201cNow it seems to have gone beyond the science and decided it has some kind of magic power as a first dose.\u201d",

      "\u201cI guess the F.D.A. is just trying to simplify given the reality on the ground,\u201d he said. But \u201cimmunologically, you\u2019d want to get two shots if it\u2019s your first exposure.\u201d",
      "The agency could instead recommend two doses of a bivalent vaccine and say that those who know of a prior infection can elect to forego the second dose, Dr. Bhattacharya said. But, he added, \u201cin reality, I doubt a clause like that would make much practical difference.\u201d",

      " and ",
      "? Also hazy. Treatment options are limited to ",
      " and just one non-hormonal drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration. All of which, Dr. Sholes-Douglas added, is a clear reflection of the scant attention and little funding devoted to medical research into this phase of a woman\u2019s life.",
      "In the last two decades, researchers have started to investigate another potential source of relief: diet. The idea stems from studies that have found that hot flashes ",
      " and might be a largely ",
      " experience. With that in mind, researchers have hypothesized that environmental factors, like diet, might play a part in this difference.",
      "But many of the studies on dietary interventions are small or inconclusive, said Dr. Stephanie Faubion, medical director for the North American Menopause Society and a director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women\u2019s Health. In studies that have suggested certain foods reduce hot flashes, the mechanisms at work are not fully understood, she added.",
      "Still, there is no harm in adjusting your diet to see if it might help manage your hot flashes, Dr. Faubion said.",
      ", like tofu and soybeans, contain isoflavones, which are chemicals that can bind to estrogen receptors in the body, said Neal Barnard, an adjunct professor of medicine at the George Washington School of Medicine. For that reason, the thinking goes, soy may mimic estrogen. It\u2019s one of the ",

      "In a pair of recent studies, Dr. Barnard and his team randomly assigned 84",

We have no idea.\u201d The women in the study also ended up losing weight, which Dr. Faubion said is noteworthy because some studies have shown ",

Beyond that, doctors often suggest avoiding certain foods and drinks that seemingly trigger a hot flash, said Dr. Hoosna Haque, an OB-GYN at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, such as \u201cspicy food, caffeine, alcohol and also really high-concentrated sugary foods and highly processed foods.\u201d",
      "But, she said, that recommendation is often based just on anecdotal evidence, and it\u2019s not fully understood why those foods and drinks might trigger a hot flash.",

      "Ultimately, \u201cwe counsel patients that a balanced, healthy diet may help relieve symptoms, but it isn\u2019t a treatment,\u201d Dr. Haque said.

      "Almost immediately after starting ",
      ", a diabetes medication known for inducing weight loss, Renata Lavach-Savy, 37, a medical writer in North Bergen, N.J., was left without any semblance of appetite. She started setting alarms to remind herself to eat. She was so exhausted that even after 10 hours of sleep, she would collapse onto her couch after work, unable to move.",
      "She left purses and clothes strewn across her bedroom floor, because she was so queasy all the time and worried that bending down to pick them up would make her vomit. Four months later, Ms. Lavach-Savy\u2019s dietitian told her that\u00a0she might be malnourished.",
      "Ms. Lavach-Savy was shocked. \u201cHow can I be malnourished? I\u2019m over 200 pounds,\u201d she recalled thinking. She stopped taking Ozempic last fall.",
      "Her doctor originally recommended Ozempic because Ms. Lavach-Savy had ",
      ", a hormonal condition that often occurs alongside insulin resistance. The weekly injections led to constant, low-level nausea, a squiggle of sickness in her stomach. She lost all desire to eat.",
      "Severe cases like Ms. Lavach-Savy\u2019s are rare, experts say. But some people taking Ozempic can experience such intense lack of appetite that they do become malnourished, said Dr. Andrew Kraftson, a clinical associate professor in the division of metabolism, endocrinology and diabetes at Michigan Medicine. Doctors say it is important that people are given clear guidance on proper diet and nutrition while on the medication. People who experience extreme outcomes from the medication ",
      " altogether.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t eat what you feel like or what you want,\u201d Ms. Lavach-Savy said in describing what it was like to be on the medication. \u201cYou have to eat what your body will accept.\u201d",
      "Ozempic works, in part, by blocking the brain\u2019s hunger signals, suppressing appetite; it also causes the stomach to empty more slowly, leading people to feel full for longer.",
      "When people are on a drug like Ozempic, doctors need to monitor them closely with regular check-ins, Dr. Kraftson said. He recommends a daily caloric intake \u2014 typically between 1,000 and 1,500 calories, individualized based on a person\u2019s starting weight and estimated metabolism \u2014 for his patients and counsels them on their diets to ensure they\u2019re getting enough nutrients.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make you vanish into nothingness,\u201d he said. If people are unable to eat enough while on the drug, he decreases the dose or tells them to stop taking the medication altogether.",
      "No standard nutritional guidelines have yet been established for patients taking Ozempic or other medications that work similarly, like Wegovy and ",
      ". Doctors usually give similar dietary recommendations to people taking drugs like Ozempic and other patients who are trying to lose weight or who have diabetes, said Dr. Robert Gabbay, the chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association. That means following a diet that is high in fruits, vegetables and fiber, like the ",
      ", said Dr. Janice Jin Hwang, the division chief of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.",
      "Avoiding high-fat foods is also critical, because they can make people taking Ozempic feel uncomfortably, even painfully full, Dr. Gabbay said. He urges people to eat slowly and pause halfway through a meal, assessing how full they actually are. \u201cYou could power through a cheeseburger and fries in five minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut wow, are you going to feel like you way overate.\u201d",
      "People taking Ozempic tend to lose weight because they consume fewer calories, not because the drug itself magically burns fat, Dr. Gabbay said. If\u00a0patients don\u2019t\u00a0regularly meet with\u00a0their doctors to ensure they are getting adequate nutrition, these medications could lead to, or exacerbate, disordered eating, Dr. Kraftson said.",
      "While scientists are still trying to understand how Ozempic affects the brain, a known side effect is that people\u2019s cravings can change. Ozempic contains semaglutide, which mimics a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1; when people take the drug, higher levels of that hormone flood the receptors in our brain that regulate our eating behaviors, Dr. Hwang said, changing how our neurons transmit signals to the rest of our body. Just as some people lose interest in once-beloved foods after ",
      ", those taking Ozempic often find that they no longer crave foods that are high in fat and sugar \u2014 both because their appetite decreases overall and potentially because of those neural changes, Dr. Hwang said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re given a choice of a salad versus fried chicken, it just becomes a little easier to make those healthy choices,\u201d she said.",
      "However, people taking these medications need to be aware of the complications that can arise from having little to no appetite. \u201cIt\u2019s never healthy to not eat,\u201d Dr. Hwang said."

But, with so many options, it\u2019s easy to reach for titles that aren\u2019t meant for beginners, said Sara Lazar, director of the Lazar Lab for Meditation Research at Massachusetts General Hospital. And that is how people \u201ctend to get into trouble,\u201d she said.",
      "So we asked half a dozen meditation experts \u2014 teachers, spiritual leaders\u200c and scientists \u2014 about their favorite beginner-friendly books. This is, by no means, an exhaustive list, but these titles might help you ",
      ".",
      "This straightforward and accessible guide, written by the Sri Lankan Buddhist monk playfully nicknamed Bhante G, is a favorite among meditation teachers and scientists alike. Written in 1994, the book presents a clear picture of mindfulness and meditation and provides insights on how to begin a practice. \u200c",
      "Dr. Jud Brewer, the director of research and innovation at Brown University\u2019s Mindfulness Center, turned to it repeatedly when he was starting to meditate, and he frequently recommends it to beginners, he said. Another plus: \u201cMindfulness in Plain English\u201d is available as a ",
      ", making it even more accessible.",
      "Ms. Salzberg, a co-founder of the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Mass., has been instrumental in popularizing mindfulness in the United States. (She also provided recommendations for this list.) \u201cReal Happiness,\u201d her 2009 title, has been popular for years, in large part because it\u2019s full of real-world examples that help illustrate the principles behind mindfulness.",
      "\u201cSalzberg\u2019s teaching style and communication style are very sensible, very thoughtful,\u201d said \u200cDr. Lazar\u200c.",
      "Several experts recommended works by Dr. Kabat-Zinn, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School who developed mindfulness-based stress reduction. In \u201cMindfulness for Beginners,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn urges readers to challenge what he calls their \u201ccurrent default setting,\u201d the automatic thoughts and reactions that govern our actions.",
      "Thich Nhat Hanh was a Vietnamese Thien Buddhist monk, activist and teacher\u200c and the author of more than 100 books. \u201cThe Miracle of Mindfulness,\u201d published in 1975, was \u200cwritten to offer advice to those suffering as a result of the Vietnam War.",
      "Ms. Salzberg recalled reading it early in her meditation years. \u201cHere was somebody actually expressing the beauty and the magic of living with more awareness and more clarity,\u201d she said. \u201cI never really heard it talked about in those terms.\u201d",
      "This 2017 title was written by Daniel Goleman, a psychologist and science journalist, and Richard Davidson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founder of the Center for Healthy Minds. While it does not necessarily offer direct instruction, it\u2019s a great way to learn all of the health benefits that a regular practice offers, said Maya Shankar, a cognitive scientist and host of the podcast \u201cA Slight Change of Plans.\u201d",
      "This book is also useful for \u201cdispelling some common myths\u201d about the science behind meditation, Dr. Shankar said.",
      "Pema Chodron began studying Tibetan Buddhism in her mid-thirties and became a novice Buddhist nun in 1974. \u200cMs. Salzberg recommended Pema Chodron\u2019s 1996 book \u201cWhen Things Fall Apart,\u201d which she said \u201cdestigmatizes states like anger, fear, sadness, and describes how to use meditation to work with them.\u201d But \u201cHow to Meditate\u201d sets beginners up with mindfulness basics without overlooking the obstacles that may emerge during the process.",
      "While not a how-to-meditate title, this 2014 memoir speaks directly to skeptics. Mr. Harris\u2019s \u201caha\u201d moment happened after he had an on-air panic attack on\u200c \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d He re-evaluated his life and turned to meditation.",
      "Mr. Harris \u201ctells a very relatable story\u201d of a high-achieving person working toward self-awareness, said Mr. Davidson, one of the authors of \u201cAltered Traits.\u201d It\u2019s an accessible read for anyone beginning their meditation path, he said.",

      "Suzuki, often called Suzuki Roshi, was a Zen Buddhist monk who helped popularize Zen in the United States. This book explains the basics \u2014 such as posture and breathing \u2014 of zazen meditation, practiced in Zen Buddhism, but it should not be considered a step-by-step tutorial. Instead, this short classic, published in 1970, is packed with insightful thoughts about the philosophy behind Zen, making an argument that keeping an open mind is critical, Ms. Salzberg said.",

      "; many of the monitoring systems that were set up at the beginning of the pandemic have also been wound down.",
      "Is this finally the beginning of the end of the pandemic, or just another spring ebb before a new variant initiates a summer wave? (For the past two years, numbers have fallen between March and June, before rising in July.) The New York Times spoke with epidemiologists and infectious disease experts to gauge how they\u2019re thinking about this particular juncture in the pandemic \u2014 what the risk is right now, what precautions they\u2019re continuing to take, who is still getting severely ill and dying, and what the future may bring.",
      "Experts agree that the risk from Covid-19 right now is low, and spring 2023 feels different from previous years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a stage of stability where people are making choices to return their lives to something closer to normal,\u201d said Dr. Robert Wachter, the chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cAnd I think that makes sense. Cases are relatively low; deaths are relatively low.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason for this improvement is that virtually everyone in the United States has some form of immunity now, whether from vaccines, a previous infection or both. Medications like ",
      " have also significantly reduced the risk of serious illness.",
      "Dr. Taison Bell, an infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia, said that in his intensive care unit, \u201cwe will see an occasional Covid-19 case, but we\u2019re not seeing a lot of cases that are leading to people being on the ventilator.\u201d Now, most of the people Dr. Bell is treating for Covid are older and either have pre-existing conditions that compromise their immune systems or lung function, or they haven\u2019t been vaccinated.

      " if they haven\u2019t already (a second dose was also ",

Variations of Omicron that have some immune-evading properties, such as the current dominant strain, ",
      ", have emerged, but Paxlovid and vaccines are still effective against them.",
      "Despite the good news, experts are still taking some precautions. Because while the numbers are headed in the right direction, roughly 100,000 Americans are still being infected with Covid-19 every week, and more than 150 are dying from the infection every day.",
      "Dr. Wachter continues to wear a mask in most crowded indoor settings, like on an airplane or in a museum, he said, but not if he needs to pop into a store quickly.",
      "His main motivation is wanting to avoid ",
      ". \u201cUnlike the way I felt two or three years ago, I have no fear that I\u2019m going to die of this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think long Covid is very real. My wife has a mild version of it, so I see it up close and personal.\u201d",
      "Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has young children, said that she stopped wearing a mask at the grocery store or in the office, though she still dons one on public transportation. She said that the disruptions Covid and other respiratory infections caused this winter, like missing school and work, were worth avoiding.",
      "The experts especially urged people to keep taking precautions, such as masking and testing before big indoor gatherings, if they or a loved one are at high risk.",
      "\u201cI think we have to do what we can to mitigate risk, not just for ourselves, but also we live in a community,\u201d said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician who still tests herself before going to events. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the person next to me is immunocompromised, and I don\u2019t want to give them Covid.\u201d",
      "The experts cautioned that it\u2019s always possible for a new variant to emerge and start another wave.",

      " for about 10 percent of cases in the United States and comes with a new symptom: conjunctivitis.",
      "Dr. Rivers is paying attention to another new subvariant, XBB.1.9.1, which makes up about 8 percent of U.S. infections right now. She expects cases to start rising again as the weather warms, driven by either these variants or one like them. \u201cWe generally see a quiet spring followed by a summer resurgence that starts in the South\u201d because people are more likely to gather indoors when it gets too hot, she said.",
      "And this, experts say, is likely our new normal. \u201cThe stage where we are now is probably a version of a stage we\u2019ll be in a year from now, maybe two years from now, maybe five years from now,\u201d Dr. Wachter said. \u201cIt could get a little worse, in which case I think people and societies change if they\u2019re being rational.

      "To maintain healthy blood sugar, energy and fullness levels until your next meal, getting ",

      "\u200cYour body needs protein to maintain your muscle mass, metabolism and physical strength\u00a0(among other things), Ms. Harris-Pincus said, but it can use only about 25 to 35 grams of protein per meal for those purposes. If you consume more protein in one sitting, your body will either use it as energy, store it as fat or excrete it.",

      ". In the vast debacle of global vaccine inequity, it was Africa that was left furthest behind as the pandemic raged, and that had the least leverage to negotiate contracts.",
      "African leaders vowed to make sure that never happened again. High-income nations and philanthropic groups promised to help fund the effort to make vaccine access more equitable. There was a flurry of announcements of new partnerships and investments: plans to modernize the handful of existing pharmaceutical manufacturing operations in Africa; plans to build new ones; plans to send shipping containers from Europe with pop-up facilities to produce the new mRNA vaccines; plans for an mRNA production incubator that would dispense open-source technology around the continent.",
      "Now, some of the hype has subsided, and there are some signs of real progress. But it\u2019s also become evident just how big the hurdles are.",
      "There aren\u2019t many shortcuts in the decades-long process of developing a sophisticated biotechnology industry that can make a routine vaccine for export, let alone develop a shot to protect against a new pathogen.",
      "The African Union has set a goal of having 60 percent of all vaccines used on the continent produced in African nations by 2040 \u2014 up from 1 percent now \u2014 an plan that looks wildly ambitious given the current production landscape.",
      "The big issue, as always, is money. The many-step process of making vaccines needs high\u00a0biosecurity and intense quality control. The expense of putting it all in place means that vaccines made in Africa are going to cost significantly more than those from the Indian pharmaceutical industry, which is the major supplier of routine vaccines used in Africa.",
      "Manufacturers such as the Serum Institute of India, the world\u2019s largest vaccine maker, have achieved huge economies of scale and have taken over much of the market share that was held by European producers. But the Covid vaccine rollout made clear that despite the low price of Indian-made vaccines, African leaders cannot afford to rely on them. In March 2021, when millions of Serum-made doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were bound for Africa, the Indian government imposed an export ban and rerouted those vaccines to its own population.",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the continent\u2019s existing vaccine market is worth an estimated $1.3 billion and is expected to grow to about $2.4 billion by 2030. But many who work in global health say buyers will have to pay a \u201cresilience premium\u201d \u2014 a higher price for African-made vaccines, the production of which helps build up the African industry. There is a lot less clarity about who is going to be willing to pay that higher price.",
      "The obvious candidate is Gavi, the organization that uses funds donated by high-income countries and major philanthropies to purchase routine and emergency vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. Gavi buys half the vaccines used in Africa today.",
      "Aur\u00e9lia Nguyen, Gavi\u2019s chief\u00a0program strategy officer, says the organization is ready to sign advance purchase contracts with new vaccine makers in developing countries, to assure business owners of an income stream that will defray investments in expansion.",
      "\u201cThe traditional market economics that got us to a place where we have strong developing-country manufacturers in Asia and Latin America are not going to get us to a place where we\u2019re going to have regional players in the African continent,\u201d she said. \u201cGavi is in a position to bridge the market failure.\u201d",
      "If Gavi is able to provide that cushion, these are the projects that experts\u00a0say are most likely to help the continent reach the goal of producing a majority of vaccines for Africans in Africa. Most will need at least three years before they have even a bottling-and-packaging line running.",
      "The Pasteur Institute of Dakar was making a million doses a year of yellow fever vaccine before Covid, and its business was flagging. But it has recently been a major target for new investment and has nearly completed a large expansion of its existing production plant. It is aiming to increase its production of yellow fever vaccine to 50 million doses a year. A second site will produce a low-cost rubella and measles vaccine for the African market, with a production target of 300 million doses.",
      "It will use a new\u00a0bio-manufacturing production platform from Univercells, a Belgian start-up that aims to make vaccine ingredients more quickly and in a smaller space.",
      "\u201cThe progress in Dakar is the fastest I\u2019ve seen anywhere in the world,\u201d said Prashant Yadav, a medical supply chain expert at the Center for Global Development who visited the institute several times over the past year.",
      "Aspen Pharmacare, one of the few serious pharmaceutical players in Africa before Covid, received an infusion of $30 million in philanthropic funds to\u00a0build up a production process for four of the main childhood vaccines, including shots for pneumonia and rotavirus.",
      "In 2021, the World Health Organization set up an \u201cmRNA production hub\u201d at a small biotechnology company in Cape Town called Afrigen\u00a0Biologics and Vaccines, with the goal of reverse-engineering the Moderna Covid vaccine and then sharing mRNA production knowledge across the global south. Afrigen will put its Covid shot into clinical trials in early 2024. There is no longer a market for Covid vaccines, but the hope is that the process of designing, testing and producing this product will build up technological know-how to make others including an mRNA shot for tuberculosis, an Afrigen priority.",
      "Afrigen\u2019s production partner is the nearby\u00a0BioVac Institute, which makes childhood vaccines for South Africa. BioVac signed a deal to bottle Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine (a process called fill-finish), and has a new licensing and technology transfer deal to produce an oral cholera vaccine with the International Vaccine Institute, a United Nations-backed international organization based in South Korea.",
      "Six shipping containers arrived in the country in mid-March to form the first \u201cBioNTainer \u2014 a pop-up mRNA vaccine manufacturing line packaged in the containers \u2014 donated by BioNTech, the maker of the mRNA technology in Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine. The modular site is intended to form the core of a new vaccine manufacturing center. It will be staffed by Europeans for the first five years, according to BioNTech.",
      "A key challenge here is that the site has no vaccine to make: There is no demand for the Covid vaccine, and BioNTech does not currently make any other product. A malaria or tuberculosis mRNA vaccine that could be useful for Rwanda and the region is most likely a decade away. The new capacity in the country is only for production; in Rwanda, as in most other African countries, there is no biotech industry capable of the kind of research and development that is essential when responding to a new pathogen, said Alain Alsalhani, a vaccines expert with Doctors Without Borders\u2019 access-to-medicines campaign.",
      "Two more companies \u2014 Biogeneric Pharma in Egypt, which will receive an mRNA technology transfer from Afrigen, and SENSYO Pharmatech in Morocco \u2014 have received significant investment to expand their production. And in Kenya, the government is having the Kenya BioVax Institute switch from producing animal vaccines to making human ones. It has tapped Dr. Michael Lusiola, an expatriate Kenyan who was a senior executive with AstraZeneca in the United Kingdom, to come home and run it.",
      "Ms. Nguyen said that having the ability to manufacture large numbers of vaccines would help to give Africa security in the event of another pandemic. The continent could build that capacity while making routine vaccines for the African market, she said.",
      "In most cases, that will mean starting with fill-finish agreements for existing vaccines \u2014 putting a bulk vaccine made somewhere else into vials. Then companies can begin manufacturing the actual drug substance and, eventually, conduct the research and develop the vaccines, either for known pathogens or for new ones.",
      "Countries will need stronger regulatory agencies so their vaccines can be quickly approved for export. They will also need better supply chains of everything that goes into vaccines. The Africa C.D.C. hopes to create regional ones, in which some countries make glass vials and others make drug substances, as a way to ensure equitable access in a future pandemic.",
      "Ms. Nguyen said she was encouraged by the number of African\u00a0initiatives that were embracing new technologies that would allow them to \u201cleapfrog.\u201d In the past, making vaccines required a huge physical footprint, so that meant producing huge volumes to pay for it.",
      "\u201cHaving a small unit that can get up and running and do five or 10 million doses and then switch to something else \u2014 I think that really changes the established marketplace,\u201d she said.",
      "Many of the new initiatives are heavily dependent on philanthropic funding, much of it from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the multilateral Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, as well as low-cost bilateral loans. It\u2019s not clear how long that enthusiasm will last. Martin Friede, who leads the vaccine research unit at the W.H.O., predicted \u201cthe Covid guilt will be over by this afternoon.\u201d He added, \u201cI just don\u2019t see South Africa agreeing to buy vaccines from Nigeria at a higher price than vaccines from India or Europe \u2014 that\u2019s a tough ask.\u201d",
      "Patrick Tippoo, the head scientist at Biovac in Cape Town and a key player in the African network of manufacturers, said that was similar to what he and his colleagues were hearing in meetings.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good will\u00a0from development financing institutions,\u201d he said, but concern about how manufacturers can repay loans. \u201cThat\u2019s reliant on product volumes and access to markets,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we kind of go around in circles a little bit.\u201d",
      "BioVac\u2019s new cholera vaccine is a prime example of the promise of this new manufacturing capacity, and the obstacles it faces. There is a ",
      ", and outbreaks are raging in several sub-Saharan countries. This will be the first time in decades that an African drugmaker will be developing a strategic vaccine, taking it through the full chain of clinical development and into manufacturing, regulatory authorization and, BioVac hopes, prequalification by the W.H.O. for global use. But it will be a many-year process \u2014 and will require construction of costly new facilities.",
      "\u201cA number of things have advanced, and if half of them succeed we will be doing well,\u201d Mr. Tippoo said. \u201cIt will take us closer \u2014 the question is, Will it take us close enough?\u201d"

      "Kaiser Permanente, a large California-based health care group with 39 hospitals and 24,000 doctors, said on Wednesday that it expected to acquire Geisinger Health, a smaller East Coast group, in an effort to develop a new company that would operate nonprofit community health systems.",
      "\u201cIf we can take much of what is in our value-based care platform and extend that to these leading community health systems, then we extend our mission,\u201d Greg A. Adams, Kaiser\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cWe reach more people, we drive greater affordability for health care in this country.\u201d Both organizations are nonprofit.",
      "Kaiser will not absorb Geisinger, which will keep its name. Instead, Geisinger, which is headquartered in Danville, Pa., will be folded into Risant Health, a new nonprofit group that will operate independently. Geisinger\u2019s chief executive, Dr. Jaewon Ryu, will serve as Risant\u2019s chief executive when the deal is closed.",
      "Federal and state regulators must approve the deal. While Mr. Adams did not say what other health systems he might be talking to regarding acquisitions, Kaiser said it hoped to invest $5 billion in Risant over the next five years, in addition to its spending on Kaiser\u2019s core operations. The company expects to add five or six health systems to Risant in that time.",
      "Kaiser, which serves 13 million people in eight states and the District of Columbia, has built a reputation for delivering high-quality care at low costs. The organization operates like a health maintenance organization, in which it is paid a fixed sum to care for someone through a closed network of hospitals and doctors. But it has not succeeded in offering its model broadly across the country.",
      "The creation of Risant Health represents an opportunity for Kaiser, which had $95 billion in revenue last year, to become an even bigger and more influential organization by working with other hospital groups and health plans.",
      "The formation of the company is also a response to the rapid changes taking place in the health care industry. Large for-profit companies like health insurers, pharmacy chains and other corporations are scooping up physician practices and urgent care centers and devouring more of the country\u2019s health care dollars.",
      "In keeping with Kaiser\u2019s model, the community health systems under Risant would invest in technology and preventive care to keep patients healthy, so they would need less expensive specialty and hospital care, Mr. Adams said.",
      "As national systems and new players grow larger, \u201cthey are pulling away in some respects from our communities and from our community health systems,\u201d he said.",
      "The new venture \u201cis a way to really ensure that not-for-profit, value-based community health is not only alive but is thriving in this country,\u201d Mr. Adams added.",
      "As hospital groups emerge from the pandemic, many are struggling with higher expenses for supplies and labor. Both Kaiser and Geisinger reported operating losses in 2022.",
      "\u201cCovid has really shown not having integrated, value-based relationships puts our health systems and our communities at risk,\u201d Mr. Adams said.",
      "While Geisinger has long focused on improving care, Dr. Ryu said the health system would benefit from Kaiser\u2019s ability to invest in the kind of technology and preventive care necessary to keep people healthier. \u201cThis model made sense to us as a way to accelerate and further bolster those capabilities and bring better health into our communities,\u201d he said.",
      "Because it has specialized in providing care under arrangements where it is paid a fixed amount, Kaiser has become one of the largest insurers in the profitable Medicare Advantage market, where its private plans are sold as an alternative to traditional Medicare.",
      "But Kaiser has not been immune to criticism for ",
      " the federal government, and some people say its financial model means it can be slow to refer patients for costly services. Kaiser has defended its billing practices and says its doctors work with patients to provide the most appropriate care."

      "More than 75 members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine demanded on Thursday that the organization explain why it has for years failed to return or repurpose millions of dollars donated by the Sackler family, including some who led Purdue Pharma.",
      "The company\u2019s drug, OxyContin, helped set in motion a prescription opioid crisis that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The New York Times reported this month that even as the Academies advised the government on opioid policy, the organization ",
      " and appointed influential members to its committees who had financial ties to Purdue Pharma.",
      "One report issued by the Academies claimed that 100 million, or 40 percent of Americans, were in chronic pain. The figure, later found to be inflated, was cited by drugmakers to convince doctors to write large numbers of opioid prescriptions.",
      "In a letter delivered to Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academies of Sciences, scientists and economists called on the organization to clarify how research committee members who ran nonprofits heavily funded by Purdue were chosen to provide guidance to federal authorities on opioid policy: \u201cHow did the system fail in the past?\u201d the letter asked.",
      "\u201cThe academy was looking like it had been morally asleep for the last 30 years,\u201d Robert Putnam, an author of the letter and Harvard public policy professor, said in an interview.",
      "\u201cWe of course take the concerns of National Academy of Sciences members seriously, and their concerns were in part what prompted very serious conversations here about returning or repurposing the funds, to which the N.A.S. remains committed,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Friday. ",
      "The National Academies was chartered in 1863 by Abraham Lincoln to advise the nation on scientific and medical questions. The institution elects new members each year \u2014 elite scientists and physicians \u2014 and delivers influential advice to the White House, Congress and federal agencies.",
      "Though about 70 percent of the National Academies budget comes from federal funds, it also raises private donations from individuals, nonprofits and companies, including Chevron, Google, Merck and Medtronic.",
      "\u201cIf they begin to see the problem \u2014 that is, this huge influx of private money, and private money often comes with implicit strings \u2014 they will see it\u2019s a threat to the core principles of the Academies,\u201d Dr. Putnam said of the National Academies\u2019 current leadership.",
      "Signatories of the letter include eight Nobel Prize winners. Two authors are National Academies of Sciences members who in 2017 urged top officials to distance the organization from the Sacklers.",
      "Robert M. Hauser, a prominent social scientist, wrote in an October 2017 email to two top Academies officials: \u201cI have been thinking about the willingness of the N.A.S. to accept support from the Sackler family and to produce events and awards \u2014 lectures, forums, colloquia, prizes \u2014 however meritorious, in their name.\u201d",
      "He and another Academies member had concluded \u201cthat the N.A.S. should disassociate itself from the Sacklers.\u201d The other member was Angus Deaton, a Nobel Laureate and co-author of a book about surging deaths tied to substance use and suicide among members of the white working class.",
      "Dr. Deaton said in an interview that he and Dr. Hauser had asked for a call with top officials about the Sacklers\u2019 involvement.",
      "\u201cWe wanted more than anything to warn them that there was a lot of trouble ahead down this route, and that tens of thousands of people were dying and the Sacklers were giving them money,\u201d Dr. Deaton recalled in an interview.",
      "Dr. Hauser, who worked at the National Academies from 2010 to 2016, referenced an in-depth ",
      " about the Sackler family\u2019s \u201cruthless\u201d marketing of OxyContin in the email, which was sent to Bruce Darling, then the executive officer, and James Hinchman, then the chief operating officer.",
      "\u201cSooner or later I thought this was going to blow up in their faces,\u201d Dr. Hauser said in an interview. \u201cAnd it would really besmirch the reputation of the Academies, which I felt strongly about defending.\u201d",
      "Four minutes after Dr. Hauser\u2019s initial request was emailed, he received a reply from Mr. Darling: \u201cWe had a conversation at the N.A.S. Council this past summer on the very issue that you raise, and we made a decision that I would be pleased to discuss with you.\u201d",
      "Mr. Darling and Mr. Hinchman did not respond to messages requesting comment. ",
      "Dr. Hauser recalled that Mr. Darling summarized the Sacklers\u2019 donations as something that had been discussed and required no new action. Dr. Deaton and Dr. Hauser felt their concerns had been dismissed.",
      "Two National Academies reports on opioids have faced criticism from experts. One published in 2011 included two panelists with significant financial ties to Purdue and concluded that 100 million Americans were in chronic pain, a number that proved to be greatly inflated. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later estimated that the condition affects 17 million to 52 million Americans.)",
      "Still, the report armed drug companies with a talking point that ",
      " with Food and Drug Administration officials who oversaw opioid approvals. It was also ",
      " in their response to a Senate inquiry.",
      "Another Academies committee on opioid policy was ",
      " by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, because of some members\u2019 links to Purdue. That panel, formed in 2016, went forward with a study after four members were replaced.",
      "Articles in ",
      " and in ",
      " ",
      ", or the British Medical Journal, have also noted the Sacklers\u2019 ties to the Academies and identified additional committee members with links to Purdue.",
      "The letter on Friday asked for \u201cclear answers\u201d to what procedures are in place to \u201censure that advisory committee members are properly vetted,\u201d among other questions.",
      "The Academies told The Times that beginning in 2019 Sackler family donations were no longer used for science-related events, research and awards, the purposes for which they were intended. The funds \u201cwere never used to support any advisory activities on the use of opioids,\u201d Megan Lowry, a spokeswoman, said.",
      "The donations amounted to roughly $19 million and, as invested funds in the institution\u2019s endowment, were worth about $31 million in late 2021, the most recent accounting available. Universities that accepted Sackler funds, including Tufts and Brown, have reallocated some of the money to addiction prevention and treatment efforts.",
      "Members of the Sackler family who were active in running Purdue Pharma began donating in 2008 to the National Academies of Sciences. The money was used to sponsor forums and studies.",
      "In 2015, family members ",
      ", according to reports by the organization\u2019s treasurer. Dr. and Ms. Sackler died in 2017 and 2019. An attorney for the family said those donations had \u201cnothing at all to do with pain, medications or anything related to the company.\u201d",
      "Dame Jillian Sackler, whose husband, Arthur, died years before OxyContin arrived on the market, began giving to the Academies in 2000, and donated $5 million by 2017, Academies reports show.",

      "A perceived lack of urgency in the statement helped prompt the new letter from Academies members. \u201cIt\u2019s another brushoff the way we read it,\u201d Dr. Hauser said.",

      "An old tuberculosis vaccine known to bolster the immune system did not prevent Covid infections among health care workers, scientists reported on Thursday.",
      "But the trial was shorter and smaller than originally designed, and the investigators said that the results did not rule out other potential benefits associated with the vaccine, known as B.C.G. for bacille Calmette-Guerin.",
      "The ",
      " was the largest clinical trial of the vaccine\u2019s potential to protect against Covid infections. B.C.G. was developed in the early 1900s to combat TB, but has since also been shown to confer protection against other illnesses, including respiratory diseases.",
      "The trial of health care workers began in March 2020, during the early days of the pandemic, when no effective treatments for Covid were available and a new vaccine against the highly infectious disease seemed to be a remote fantasy. The hope was that the old vaccine might be repurposed to save lives.",
      "Six months after vaccination with B.C.G., however, there were no significant differences between the two groups of health care workers: While 14.7 percent of those inoculated with B.C.G. developed symptomatic Covid infections, 12.3 percent of those who received saline placebo shots got sick.",
      "Five participants in each group were hospitalized, and one participant who got the placebo died. The differences were not statistically significant.",
      "The remarkably rapid development of mRNA vaccines made it impossible to complete the B.C.G. trial as designed because health care workers were first in line to get the newly available mRNA shots.",
      "The goal of the B.C.G. trial had been to follow 10,000 participants from five countries \u2014 Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, Britain and Brazil \u2014 for 12 months, but the new paper reports on only 4,000 adults who were followed for six months.",
      "The mRNA vaccines were \u201can absolute miracle of modern science,\u201d said Dr. Nigel Curtis, the trial\u2019s chief investigator, who is a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Melbourne in Australia. \u201cBut from the trial\u2019s point of view, it was fairly disastrous.\u201d",
      "A still larger trial would have been required to see whether the vaccine protected against not just infections but also hospitalizations and deaths from Covid.",
      "The vaccine is still widely used in the developing world, where many babies die before their first birthdays. Scientists have found that B.C.G. inoculation reduces infant mortality. In addition to protecting babies from tuberculosis, the vaccine appears to train the immune system to respond to other pathogens, and reduces rates of respiratory illnesses and other diseases.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of our trial \u2014 that B.C.G. does not protect health care workers against mild or moderate Covid \u2014 is true,\u201d Dr. Curtis said.",
      "But it may still hold promise, he added: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the ability to protect people in other age groups against infections. B.C.G. is still a very important concept in infants.\u201d",
      "Additional analysis of the data collected from inoculated health care workers is continuing. The vaccine\u2019s effects may vary depending on the virus or bacterium it is pitted against, Dr. Curtis said.",
      "The B.C.G. vaccine contains live modified bacteria that have been cultivated in labs around the world for decades, introducing mutations that have led to a number of strains. Differing strains of B.C.G. and varying inoculation regimens may account for inconsistent results in other studies, some experts say.",
      "One of the most successful so far has been a ",
      " who received multiple B.C.G. inoculations before the pandemic in an effort to improve their blood sugar levels and to reduce infections.",
      "That study found that those who received B.C.G. had far fewer Covid infections than participants who got placebo shots."

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 In the fall of 1994, the psychiatrist Dr. Judith Herman was at the height of her influence. Her book \u201cTrauma and Recovery,\u201d published two years earlier, had been ",
      " as \u201cone of the most important psychiatric works to be published since Freud.\u201d",
      "Her research on sexual abuse in the white, working class city of Somerville, Mass., laid out a thesis that was, at the time, radical: that trauma can occur not only in the blind terror of combat, but quietly, within the four walls of a house, at the hands of a trusted person.",
      "More than most areas of science, psychology has been driven by individual thinkers and communicators. So what happened to Dr. Herman \u2014 as arbitrary as it was \u2014 had consequences for the field. She was in a hotel ballroom, preparing to present her latest findings, when she tripped on the edge of a rug and smashed her kneecap.",
      "\u201cJust, wham,\u201d she said. \u201cSmack.\u201d",
      "On and off for more than two decades, Dr. Herman groped her way through a fog of chronic pain, undergoing repeated surgeries and, finally, falling back on painkillers. The trauma researchers who surrounded her in the Boston area moved on with their work, and the field of trauma studies swung toward neurobiology.",
      "\u201cShe is a brilliant woman who lost 25 years of her career,\u201d said her friend and colleague Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, whose 2014 book, \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score,\u201d helped propel the field toward brain science. \u201cIf you talk about tragedy, that is a tragedy.\u201d",
      "At the age of 81, Dr. Herman has rejoined the conversation, publishing ",
      "\u201cTrauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence \u2014 From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror.\u201d During that period, trauma has gained broad acceptance in popular culture as a way to understand mental health.",
      "But the dominant idea now comes from Dr. van der Kolk, who argues that traumatic experiences are stored in the body and can best be addressed through the unconscious mind. \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score\u201d has appeared ",
      ". TikTok bulges with testimonials from members of Gen Z, identifying ",
      " as trauma responses.",
      "Dr. Herman does not want to use this flush of attention to debate her old friend. But in \u201cTruth and Repair,\u201d she picks up where she left off in 1992, arguing that trauma is, at its heart, a social problem rather than an individual one.",
      "Drawing on interviews with survivors, she ",
      " designed to help them heal, centering on collective acknowledgment of what they have suffered. Her approach is frankly political, rooted in the feminist movement and unlikely to go viral on TikTok.",
      "This does not seem to trouble her at all. \u201cIn my own life, I feel like I\u2019m in a good place,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, I think psychiatry will have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into any kind of progressive future.\u201d",
      "When Dr. Herman and Dr. van der Kolk met in the 1980s, she was treating the daughters of working-class Irish and Italian families, who were coming forward with stories of sexual abuse. He had been treating veterans who seemed trapped in the past, exploding with extreme rage at minor frustrations.",
      "She was reserved; he was expansive. Dr. Herman likes to call herself \u201cplain vanilla,\u201d doggedly faithful to psychodynamic psychotherapy; Dr. van der Kolk is \u201cflavor of the month,\u201d always exploring new treatments, first Prozac, then body work and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.",
      "They had this in common: The patients they treated had been routinely dismissed by the psychiatric establishment as malingerers or hysterics. \u201cWe were in explicit agreement,\u201d Dr. van der Kolk said. \u201cWe noted that people in academia were often very cruel to each other, and we made a pledge to have each other\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "The diagnosis of PTSD was brand-new, having first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, in 1980, and the Boston area, Dr. van der Kolk said, \u201cwas to trauma what Vienna was to music.\u201d A trauma study group convened monthly in the elegant stretch of Cambridge mansions known as Professors\u2019 Row.",
      "Passing around glasses of sherry and cups of coffee, they argued, Dr. Herman said, about \u201cwhat counted\u201d as trauma. \u201cThe guys who worked with the vets, we had some back and forth, shall we say,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had some knockdown drag-outs, calling out the sexism of the men who thought combat trauma was trauma and everything else was just whining.\u201d",
      "Dr. Herman is widely credited with putting this question to rest. \u201cTrauma and Recovery\u201d addressed a general audience in \u201cmeasured, gripping, almost surgically precise\u201d language, as the Times review put it, and with the authority of a Harvard psychiatrist.",
      "Her ideas also radiated into the communities where she practiced, said Rosie McMahan, whose family worked with Dr. Herman and her colleague Emily Schatzow to confront sexual abuse by her father.",
      "\u201cShe did this remarkable thing \u2014 \u2018Wait a minute, the same things that were happening to those soldiers, in a sense, happened in families,\u2019\u201d said Ms. McMahan, whose book, ",
      " describes her family\u2019s reconciliation. \u201cThey recognized that it was trauma and called it such. They behaved as if it was.\u201d",
      "Their ideas were gaining ground. In 1994, the editors of the DSM expanded the definition of PTSD, dropping the requirement that the traumatic event be \u201coutside the range of usual human experience.\u201d Dr. Herman and Dr. van der Kolk began lobbying for the inclusion of complex PTSD, the result of recurring or long-term traumatic events.",
      "Then came what\u2019s known as the \u201cmemory wars\u201d \u2014 a pushback from leading psychiatrists against therapy that encouraged patients to unearth memories of sexual abuse. The criticism often zeroed in on Dr. van der Kolk, who served as an expert witness in high-profile cases, and Dr. Herman, whose work on dissociation was regularly cited by defenders of repressed-memory therapy.",
      "Dr. Herman shrugged off this critique as \u201cpredictable,\u201d the same resistance that Vietnam War veterans and rape victims had encountered when they came forward. \u201cYou know, history is a dialectical process,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you have a movement that challenges the power structure, you\u2019re going to have a backlash.\u201d",
      "Some clinicians did go overboard, Dr. van der Kolk said. They \u201cstarted talking about satanic ritual abuse, kids being sacrificed in altars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt got a little bit weird. Judy and I never went with that crowd. But they were part of our crowd.\u201d",
      "By the time the debate faded, his laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital had been shut down, and he lost his affiliation with Harvard Medical School. \u201cAlmost all of us bit the dust in the memory wars,\u201d he added.",
      "Since the mid-1990s, the editors of the DSM have consistently opposed further expanding the definition of PTSD. The original definition was \u201cintentionally strict, meant to avoid the possibility that all mental disorders are simply caused by trauma,\u201d said Dr. Allen Frances, who chaired the task force for the DSM\u2019s fourth edition.",
      "While stress contributes to most psychiatric problems, he said, PTSD diagnoses can be made quickly and carelessly, without pursuing underlying mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Taking that leap, he added, means \u201call the rest of the knowledge ever accumulated about mental disorders goes out the window.\u201d",
      "Dr. Frances was similarly skeptical of \u201ctrauma-informed therapy,\u201d which he said provided \u201ca misleadingly reassuring explanation\u201d to complicated psychiatric problems. He added that proponents of the idea, like Dr. Herman and Dr. van der Kolk, had succeeded in winning over a large part of the general public.",
      "\u201cYou can write best-sellers on this because it\u2019s an appealing model for people searching for an explanation for the distress in life,\u201d Dr. Frances said. That avenue was closing. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing that happened.",
      "On the day she broke her kneecap, Dr. Herman was preparing to deliver a workshop on her latest findings, and was carrying a carousel of slides to a projector. She was distracted and did not see that a binding had come loose from the rug.",
      "Dr. Herman has offered vague explanations for the 30-year gap between her books. \u201cLife intervened, in the form of illnesses and a move to an assisted-living community,\u201d she writes in a forward to \u201cTruth and Repair.\u201d In an interview, she flicked away the question, calling it \u201ca very long, sad tale which I won\u2019t bore you with.\u201d",
      "But there is a story. Her kneecap healed, but nerve tumors had formed in her leg, and the pain grew steadily worse. For long stretches, daily life became a challenge. There were remissions, but there were also times she could not get out of bed, where even changing positions was \u201cextremely, extremely painful.\u201d At one point, she was so desperate that she asked a doctor if he could amputate her leg.",
      "\u201cAll you could think about was pain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even thinking about pain. It was being pain. One\u2019s existence was just pain. It\u2019s like being in a tunnel.\u201d Like \u201cyour whole existence is pain, and nothing exists outside of it,\u201d she added.",
      "There was a subtext in her doctors\u2019 response, early on, which she, as a fellow physician, was uniquely qualified to identify: They did not quite believe her. \u201cI was a middle-aged woman with pain of unexplained origin,\u201d she said. In the jargon of medical residents, she said, she was a \u201ccrock,\u201d or a female hypochondriac.",
      "Eleven years and three surgeries later, her doctors said there was nothing more they could do. This was the worst of it, when there was no hope of reprieve. \u201cIt made me not want to live,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is literally what happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cJudy\u2019s fall had a gigantic impact,\u201d Dr. van der Kolk said. \u201cWhen you talk about suffering, that was suffering. She was really suffering physically. A large part of the joy and triumph of publishing a great book she did not get to enjoy.\u201d",
      "He also said the injury had created a distance in their relationship. He was on fire with the ideas that would later become \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score,\u201d among them a view that chronic pain may be an expression of suppressed trauma. He thought he could help. But she was, he said, \u201ctoo injured to be all that curious.\u201d After that, he said, \u201cJudy and I started to go in different directions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt really was the source of sadness on my part, as I was entering this body world, that Judy did not go in the same direction,\u201d he said.",
      "Dr. Herman had little recollection of this exchange. But she did not see any larger meaning to her pain; it was just pain, a bunch of malfunctioning neurons, and it preoccupied her entirely. She was fitted with a brace and crutches, and managed to continue teaching and supervising trainees by taking large doses of fentanyl, applied through a transdermal patch.",
      "Asked what the experience taught her, she paused and said, \u201cI guess I just had more empathy for people who go through various forms of torture.\u201d",
      "A remedy appeared in 2019, almost by chance. She had gone to see a surgeon about arthritis in her hand, and instead, he peered at her knee. After she left, he emailed her ",
      " about a surgery that had been developed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to treat amputees, war veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "Later that year, surgeons removed the damaged nerves, sutured them to a motor nerve harvested from her quadriceps and then implanted them into her muscle. She weaned herself off fentanyl, set aside the brace and the crutches. She compared the relief she felt to the sensation women have when childbirth ends.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s really heavenly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in a permanent state of gratitude.\u201d",
      "And that, she said, was why she had the energy to finish another book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a totally crazy story,\u201d she said. \u201cI owe it all to the forever wars.\u201d",
      "When Dr. Herman walked into a launch event at the Harvard Book Store last month, wearing orthopedic shoes and multiple shades of purple, there was an intake of breath from the audience, largely made up of older women in mental health professions.",
      "The store offered books on healing trauma through weight lifting, quitting one\u2019s job or blocking the nerves known as the stellate ganglion; books on trauma in the music of Dolly Parton, polyamorous families and the Indian caste system; and, of course, \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score,\u201d one of those books that, the store\u2019s buying manager said, \u201ceven people who aren\u2019t necessarily readers have heard about.\u201d",
      "This did not escape Dr. Herman\u2019s admirers, who waited in folding chairs, grumbling discreetly about the authors who rode on her coattails. \u201cAll the noise around trauma is all about white men,\u201d remarked Mary Gorman, a psychiatric nurse specialist. \u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s the forgotten stepchild.\u201d",
      "Dr. van der Kolk, who has been helping Dr. Herman to publicize her book, was acutely aware of this dynamic. \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score,\u201d he said, benefited enormously from its focus on neurobiology. \u201cIn the culture right now, if it\u2019s based on the brain, it\u2019s real,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything else is woozy stuff.\u201d",
      "As his book neared publication, he said, he worried that it would supplant Dr. Herman\u2019s as the best-known title on trauma. \u201cShe must have known that, to some degree, I would bump her to second position,\u201d he said. \u201cI wondered how she would deal with it.\u201d",
      "Considering the whole story, he sounded stricken. Were it not for her injury, he said, \u201cJudy really would have been the queen of trauma.\u201d",
      "Dr. Herman, in contrast, sounded cheerful as she looked back on it all. For a woman of her generation to become a full professor at Harvard was a big deal, she said. As for the years lost to pain, she said that the work she had done in her 40s and 50s had already helped to launch a generation of younger scholars.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much of a cult of personality,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field is haunted by all that. But in my case, once \u2018Trauma and Recovery\u2019 came out, I wasn\u2019t the only messenger.\u201d",
      "At 81, she has the aches and pains of old age, but cannot shake the feeling of having been reborn. In the Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movements, and in the psychiatric residents she supervises, she sees a return to the politics that shaped her as a young doctor. ",
      "\u201cI\u2019m back in that exploring kind of moment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite exciting. I just wish I had a 40-year-old body instead of an 80-year-old body to be able to keep up with it.\u201d"

      "Speaking two languages provides the enviable ability to make friends in unusual places. A new study suggests that bilingualism may also come with another benefit: improved memory in later life.",

      " of learning, memory, language and self-control than patients who spoke only one language.",
      "The findings, published in the April issue of the journal Neurobiology of Aging, add to two decades of work ",
      " and cognitive decline in older people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s promising that they report that early and middle-life bilingualism has a beneficial effect on cognitive health in later life,\u201d said Miguel Arce Renter\u00eda, a neuropsychologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis would line up with the existing literature.\u201d",
      "In recent years, scientists have gained a greater understanding of bilingualism and the aging brain, though not all their findings have aligned. Some have found that if people who have fluency in two languages develop dementia, they\u2019ll ",
      " than people who speak one language. But other research has shown ",
      " from bilingualism.",
      "Neuroscientists hypothesize that because bilingual people ",
      ", they may be able to deploy similar strategies in other skills \u2014 such as multitasking, managing emotions and self-control \u2014 that help delay dementia later on.",
      "The new study tested 746 people age 59 to 76. Roughly 40 percent of the volunteers had no memory problems, while the others were patients at memory clinics and had experienced confusion or memory loss.",
      "All were tested on a variety of vocabulary, memory, attention and calculation tasks. They were asked to recall previously named objects, for example, and to spell words backward, follow three-part commands and copy designs presented to them.",
      "Volunteers who reported using a second language daily between age 13 and 30 or between age 30 and 65 had higher scores on language, memory, focus, attention, and decision-making abilities compared with those who were not bilingual at those ages.",
      "Investigating bilingualism at different life stages is a unique approach, said Boon Lead Tee, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. With the impressively large sample size, she said, the authors of the study can probably generate other novel results, such as whether the age at which a person acquired each language affected their cognition in later life.",
      "She cautioned, however, that the study only focused on one aspect of bilingualism: using two languages every day for long periods of time. The positive effects on cognition may turn out to be caused by another factor, such as the age at which the two languages were encoded into memory, or the particular demographic or life experiences of people who happen to be bilingual.",
      "Other experts agreed that the results might have been different if the researchers had asked volunteers if they had spoken a second language once a week, or even less frequently, rather than every day.",
      "\u201cI think there isn\u2019t a definition that everybody agrees upon, and I think there will never be because being a bilingual is a full spectrum,\u201d said Esti Blanco-Elorrieta, a language researcher at Harvard University.",
      "It\u2019s also crucial for future research to look at the broader benefits of bilingualism, said Dr. Blanco-Elorrieta, who speaks Basque, English, German and Spanish.",
      "\u201cThe advantage of being bilingual doesn\u2019t really lie on these milliseconds of advantage that one can have in a cognitive task,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the importance of being bilingual is being able to communicate with two cultures and two ways of seeing the world.\u201d"

      "Scientists have long known that dense breast tissue is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in women. A ",
      " in JAMA Oncology adds a new twist, finding that while breast density declines with age, a slower rate of decline in one breast often precedes a cancer diagnosis in that breast.",
      "Scientists at Washington University in St. Louis analyzed breast density changes over a 10-year period in 10,000 women who were free of cancer when the study started. Some 289 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in that time; the study compared changes in their breast tissue to those in 658 similar women who did not develop breast cancer.",
      "Breast density was higher from the start in the women who went on to develop breast cancer, and density declined in all women over time. But when each breast\u2019s density was measured separately, scientists found a significantly slower decline in density in breasts that developed cancer, when compared with the other breast in the same patient.",
      "Shu Jiang, the study\u2019s lead author and an associate professor of public health sciences at Washington University, said the findings might provide an individualized and dynamic tool for assessing a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk. \u201cI hope they can get this into clinical use as soon as possible \u2014 it will make a huge difference,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, everybody only looks at density at one point in time,\u201d Dr. Jiang added. But women have mammograms at regular intervals throughout their lives, and the density of each breast is measured each time.",
      "\u201cSo this information is actually already available, but it\u2019s not being utilized,\u201d she said. Now, a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer could \u201cbe updated every time she gets a new mammogram.\u201d",
      "Breast density is now an acknowledged risk factor for breast cancer, albeit one of many. Dense tissue also makes tumors harder to detect in imaging scans.",
      "Dozens of states have started requiring mammography centers to notify women if they have dense breast tissue. In March, the Food and Drug Administration recommended that providers tell women about their breast density.",
      "But this is the first study to measure changes in density over time and to report a link to breast cancer.",
      "Though larger studies will need to be done to confirm the findings, Karen Knudsen, chief executive of the American Cancer Society, called the data \u201cexciting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the first study I\u2019ve seen that looks specifically across time at changes from breast to breast, instead of averaging the two breasts, where you might miss these changes,\u201d Dr. Knudsen said.",
      "Although women are provided the information about breast density and the risks associated with it, the study suggests that information could be better used. \u201cWe need to know how to follow women with dense breasts, instead of just alerting them,\u201d Dr. Knudsen said.",
      "One next step may to be examine breast density over time in women taking medication to prevent breast cancer to see if the density decreases, Dr. Knudsen suggested.",
      "\u201cThere could be different risk stratification guidelines set up to monitor those who are having much slower decline in tissue density, versus those who are not,\u201d Dr. Jiang said."

      "But at the heart of the league are its players, most of whom could not cut it at the major league level or never made it there in the first place. That is where Murphy stands out. At his peak, he was a star making more than $108,000 a game. In the Atlantic League, the maximum allowable salary is $3,000 a month. The league\u2019s other players are dreaming of a career that Murphy already had.",
      "A solid hitter and second baseman for the bulk of his tenure with the Mets, he had a breakout stretch in the team\u2019s run to the 2015 World Series. Utilizing a dramatically reworked swing, he ",

      "On the heels of his success, he signed a three-year, $37.5 million contract with the Washington Nationals and took his game to another level. As the face of ",
      ", he made back-to-back All-Star Games, led the National League in doubles twice and finished second to Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs for the N.L.\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award in 2016.",
      "After a trade to the Cubs and two disappointing years with the Colorado Rockies, Murphy, at 35, suddenly faced the moment every athlete fears: The game no longer wanted him.",
      "Murphy was known for prioritizing his family. His decision to take parental leave for the birth of one of his three children was criticized by fans but led to ",
      ". So it was not surprising that his plans for retirement included taking college classes and spending more time with his two sons and his daughter. But baseball didn\u2019t let go.",
      "In his spare time, he found himself rewatching Ken Burns\u2019s \u201cBaseball,\u201d a nine-part, 18-hour documentary on the history of America\u2019s national pastime. Murphy saw the game with fresh eyes and wanted back in.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how cool our game was,\u201d Murphy said at the Ducks\u2019 Fan Fest on Saturday. He added, \u201cI think when you\u2019re in it, and you\u2019re trying to be as productive as you can and as good a teammate as you can be, and a husband and a father, I underestimated just how cool our game was and how cool the guys were who played before me.\u201d",
      "In a league known for its innovations, Murphy\u2019s comeback attempt has an experiment of his own, which was inspired by watching his children play baseball.",
      "\u201cI observed the way my children moved,\u201d he said. \u201cMy swing wasn\u2019t the same as theirs. They seemed to swing it with their whole body. I was probably a bit more of a hand swinger. It seemed to be similar to the way Ted Williams and Willie Mays and Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth swung the bat. They looked like they played like children. So I\u2019m going to try to play like a child.\u201d",
      "In bringing that new swing to the Ducks, Murphy chose a difficult path back to baseball\u2019s biggest stage. But it is one that worked for other former M.L.B. stars, including Dontrelle Willis and Carlos Baerga, who parlayed late-career stints with the Ducks into brief returns to the majors. Overall, the Ducks have sent 27 players to the big leagues in their 35-year history.",
      "This year, the Ducks\u2019 roster features a typical blend of young, undrafted players; minor leaguers released before they earned a call-up; and a few other major leaguers attempting comebacks. Adeiny Hechavarr\u00eda, who played for the Mets and the Yankees, is on the roster. So is Rub\u00e9n Tejada, a teammate of Murphy\u2019s on the 2015 Mets who ",

      ".",
      "There was even speculation that the former Mets pitcher Matt Harvey could join the squad after his surprising performances for Italy in the World Baseball Classic.",
      "For now, however, Murphy, who went 3 for 4 on Friday, is the main attraction.",
      "Last weekend, Tommy Palamara, 13, of Setauket, N.Y., had waited eagerly in the stands for Murphy to sign autographs. \u201cI know him because of the 2015 Mets,\u201d he said, before admitting, \u201cI was too young to remember it, but I\u2019m told I watched him.\u201d",
      "Scott Nitz, a Mets fan and Ducks season-ticket holder from West Islip, N.Y., said he is excited to cheer on Murphy this season. \u201cHe\u2019s been at the top. But he\u2019s at a level now where he\u2019s humble,\u201d Nitz said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that he came back. I hope someone picks him up, and I hope it\u2019s fast.\u201d",
      "Ducks Manager Wally Backman, himself a former second baseman for the Mets, thinks Murphy has as good a chance as any.",
      "\u201cHe still has all the bat speed,\u201d Backman said. \u201cI know the last year he was with Colorado, he had a bad hand, and he tried to play through it. I believe just from watching him play yesterday, with the National League bringing in the D.H., I think there\u2019ll be a spot for him.\u201d",
      "And beyond Murphy\u2019s own goals, Backman said his experience could make a huge difference for the Ducks\u2019 younger players.",
      "\u201cThe older guys and the levels they\u2019ve been at, they\u2019re not going to let those younger guys out-hustle them,\u201d Backman said. \u201cWe saw it yesterday when Murphy hit a ball down the right-field line and he had to leg out a double, and then later he makes a diving play at first base. That rubs off on the young guys. They\u2019ll bust their butt because they see the work ethic in the older guys.\u201d",
      "Murphy, for his part, is trying to focus on the journey.",
      "\u201cThis is a brand-new adventure,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a bit of baseball left in me, and I want to find out.\u201d",
      "Glancing at his younger teammates, he added: \u201cI still like base hits, though. It\u2019s a lot more fun when you get hits.\u201d"

This time, Young gave the Celtics fits \u2014 averaging 29.2 points and 10.2 assists over the series \u2014 but Boston dumped Young\u2019s Hawks from the playoffs in six games.",
      "Now Young, who just finished his fifth season, is facing an existential challenge more daunting than any one playoff round: the Narrative. It once made him a star. It can also take that distinction away.",

But for us internally, we see Trae, the human. Trae, the man. And how is he continuously taking his game 1 percent better, 2 percent better over time? So the expectation is really to grow.\u201d",

      "The Knicks walked off the court at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon with their shoulders slumped. The energy that gripped the arena at the start of the game against Miami had dissolved into a m\u00e9lange of people shuffling out, Heat fans boasting and a few Knicks fans shouting insults, mostly at the game officials and the Heat fans.",
      "Perspective is difficult to have in a moment like this.",
      "\u201cI was horrific,\u201d said Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson, who scored 25 points but missed all seven of his 3-point attempts.",
      "On Sunday, the Knicks lost to the Heat, 108-101, in Game 1 of the N.B.A.\u2019s Eastern Conference semifinals. They lost even though the Heat star Jimmy Butler didn\u2019t have the kind of scoring explosion he used to knock off the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the playoffs.",
      "But despite the dour mood that engulfed the Garden after the game, it would be unwise to bury the Knicks for their performance. In some ways, everything the Knicks are doing in the playoffs is a bonus. Perhaps more important, there is still time for them to survive this series.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thought this game was going to be, or the series was going to be, won or lost in the first game,\u201d Knicks guard Josh Hart said. He added later: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an opportunity that we let slip away. It\u2019s going to be a tough, physical series and every game\u2019s different.\u201d",
      "Neither the Heat nor the Knicks were expected to last very long in the playoffs.",
      "The Knicks finished the regular season as the fifth seed in the East, facing a Cleveland Cavaliers team that had traded for the star the Knicks wouldn\u2019t \u2014 Donovan Mitchell.",
      "The Heat faced even longer odds as the eighth seed against a Bucks team expected to compete for the championship and led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is a finalist for this year\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award.",
      "Instead, the Heat and the Knicks easily dispatched their first-round opponents, each needing just five games to do it. Miami benefited from an injury to Antetokounmpo and the dynamism of Butler. Butler scored 56 points in Miami\u2019s Game 4 win against the Bucks and 42 in the series-clinching win two days later.",
      "That meant containing Butler would be critical for the Knicks, a team driven by its defense and depth.",
      "The Knicks had home-court advantage and a tactical advantage in that Coach Tom Thibodeau knows Butler well. He coached Butler with the Chicago Bulls for Butler\u2019s first four seasons in the N.B.A., and again when Butler played for the Minnesota Timberwolves.",
      "On Sunday, Butler had 25 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. More critically, the attention he commanded on the court made things easier for his teammates, many of whom have thrived under playoff pressure before.",
      "The Knicks\u2019 shooting was also particularly damaging for them. Brunson wasn\u2019t the only one who struggled from 3. Overall, the Knicks made only 20.6 percent of their 3-pointers, including just 3 of 16 in the first half.",
      "With 5 minutes 5 seconds remaining, Butler struggled to rise from the court after turning his ankle while tangling with Hart. He refused to leave the game. With Butler hobbled, the Heat relied on guard Kyle Lowry and extended their lead to 11 points from 3.",
      "\u201cThat certainly is inspiring that he would not come out of the game,\u201d Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd to be able to finish the game just infused a bunch of confidence to the rest of the guys that we have to finish this off.\u201d",
      "Historically, when the Heat and Knicks have played each other in the playoffs, the battles have more closely resembled boxing matches than basketball games. Their physicality was legendary in the 1990s, with the Knicks\u2019 Patrick Ewing and Miami\u2019s Alonzo Mourning, both of whom were at Sunday\u2019s game, going at each other in the paint.",
      "Sunday\u2019s game was higher scoring than those contests from a quarter-century ago, but was similarly physical.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t just assume that each game is going to look like this,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played these guys four times during the regular season. Two of the games were in the mud like this, the throwback Heat and Knicks that you would expect. And then we had two shootouts.\u201d",
      "But he also said he expected the series to be a \u201ccagefight.\u201d",
      "What the Knicks have done already this postseason is cause for optimism for their future.",
      "They were not supposed to make a deep playoff run this year even with Brunson, who was a finalist for the league\u2019s Most Improved Player Award. The Knicks are widely considered to be one superstar away from being championship contenders. If they win this series and get to the conference finals, they will have surpassed most expectations.",
      "They have avoided the kind of ridiculous drama that characterized the decade-long desert they wandered through until creating a stable environment with Thibodeau at the helm.",
      "The Knicks beat the Cavaliers soundly, justifying their unwillingness to gut their roster in order to trade for Mitchell.",
      "Their depth propelled them against Cleveland. It is why they have often succeeded even when playing short-handed.",
      "On Sunday, they were playing without Julius Randle, who is out with a sprained ankle. Thibodeau refused to use that as an excuse for why they lost the game.",
      "\u201cWe have more than enough,\u201d he said after the game.",
      "The Heat were also missing a key player \u2014 guard Tyler Herro, who broke his hand during the first round and is expected to be out for several weeks.",
      "Butler did not address reporters after the game, and Spoelstra said he didn\u2019t know the status of Butler\u2019s injury. But if it is serious, it could change the complexion of the series. Still, the Knicks saw what the Heat did in the first round against the Bucks and know how difficult they can be.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re never going to give up,\u201d Knicks forward RJ Barrett said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I personally enjoy about this series. It\u2019s going to be hard-fought. It\u2019s going to be tough. You\u2019ve got to go out there and kind of take it.\u201d"

      "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In an otherwise quiet moment before the Sacramento Kings took the court for their most important playoff game in nearly two decades, Harrison Barnes gathered his teammates around him and urged them to focus on the task at hand so they could take the series back to Sacramento.",
      "At the ripe age of 30, Barnes is considered a voice of wisdom on a team brimming with youth. The Kings are so bouncy and bubbly that they seem almost carbonated. Perhaps their postseason inexperience is serving them well in their first-round series with the Golden State Warriors.",
      "After all, the basketball gods were not favoring the Kings ahead of Game 6 on Friday night. They were on the brink of elimination after having lost three straight, a grim stretch that included a loss in Sacramento on Wednesday. De\u2019Aaron Fox, the team\u2019s All-Star point guard, was coping with a broken finger on his shooting hand. And, of course, the Kings were facing Golden State, a championship-tested team that appeared to have found its rhythm.",
      "So, what did the Kings do? They assembled one of their most complete games of the season in a 118-99 victory that tied the series at three games apiece and ensured a Game 7 in Sacramento on Sunday afternoon, signaling to everyone \u2014 as if anyone needed proof at this late stage \u2014 that ",
      ".",
      "There was never any question that the Kings were talented and brash. But they are resilient, too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no pressure for us because didn\u2019t nobody think we would be here,\u201d said the Kings guard Malik Monk, 25, who ",
      " off the bench. \u201cMan, I\u2019ve never been to a Game 7, so I don\u2019t know what to expect. I just know I\u2019m going to go out there and play 110 percent, give it my all and continue to do what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d",
      "The winner of the game on Sunday will face the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals starting Tuesday. The Lakers advanced by defeating the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, 125-85, in Game 6 of their first-round series.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big opportunity,\u201d said Fox, 25, who scored 26 points with an avulsion fracture on his left index finger, an injury that he sustained earlier in the series. \u201cEverybody doesn\u2019t get to experience a Game 7, and not a lot of people get to experience a Game 7 in Sacramento.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cFrom start to finish, I feel like this is probably the best game that we\u2019ve played this year.\u201d",
      "The Warriors remain a mystery. Even as ",
      ", they have not exactly carried themselves with an air of inevitability, as they did in the 2014-15 season, when they coasted into the playoffs with a 67-15 record, or in the 2017-18 season, which they punctuated with their third title in four years.",
      "This latest iteration of the Warriors \u2014 even with their familiar core \u2014 is an abstract painting. There is ",
      ". Momentum is a foreign concept. Some nights, they produce basketball as high art. Other nights, they look uninspired or \u2014 gasp! \u2014 a little old. During the regular season, they had the one of the best records in the league at home and one of the worst records in the league on the road. Go figure.",
      "But Golden State\u2019s victory at Sacramento in Game 5 was one of those rare road triumphs. And it seemed a strong indication that the Warriors had unearthed some of their former magic, that they were, according to Coach Steve Kerr, \u201ca different team\u201d than they had been earlier this season or even ",
      ". More cohesive. More determined. And fully capable of elevating their play in the postseason.",
      "Back home for Game 6 on Friday, Golden State was in a position to do what it had done so many times before \u2014 win and advance. Instead, the Kings went with a smaller lineup, pushed the pace and still managed to outrebound the Warriors, 53-42. Golden State shot 37.2 percent from the field. Stephen Curry missed three free throws and committed five turnovers.",
      "\u201cThey was a little tired,\u201d Monk said. \u201cWe were a little younger than they are, so we knew we could take advantage of that. So we\u2019re going to try to do the same thing on Sunday.\u201d",
      "Curry, 35, who scored 29 points in the loss, cited \u201cmental errors\u201d as the culprit.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if that was an energy thing or a focus thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you have to be able to learn those lessons quick. Because we put ourselves in a situation where we have to be the team that\u2019s playing with desperation.\u201d",
      "Before they closed out the regular season as the No. 3 seed in the West, the Kings had gone 16 seasons without a playoff appearance. It has been 19 seasons since they won a series.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to play at our best,\u201d the Kings Coach Mike Brown said of Game 7. \u201cThey\u2019re the champions. We\u2019re going to have to play at an elite level for 48 minutes against these guys because they\u2019re going to bring it, trust me.\u201d",
      "After wins this season, the Kings have been ",
      " from the roof of Golden 1 Center, their arena in Sacramento. When the team goes on the road, the players bring a bit of the beam with them, affixing a pair of pocket-size, purple-hued strobe lights to stalls in the visiting locker room.",
      "Those lights were flashing after the game on Friday, a small celebration that the Kings hope foreshadows a more significant one."

      "Presumably, Daniel Levy was going for a more flattering vibe. One day last month, Levy, the chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, told the students of the Cambridge University Union that he hoped a statue of Harry Kane would stand outside the club\u2019s stadium one day, possibly its greatest-ever striker immortalized in bronze.",
      "Levy was, surely, simply trying to illustrate the scale of Kane\u2019s achievements, the esteem in which he is held, ",
      " at the club he supported as a child and has frequently carried as an adult. It was merely unfortunate that it came across as just a little bit like emotional blackmail.",
      "This is, of course, a pivotal summer for Kane. At the end of June, he will formally enter the final 12 months of the six-year contract he signed at Tottenham on the eve of the World Cup in 2018. A few weeks later, he will turn 30. If he is to leave Spurs, then it is hard to escape the impression that it is now or never.",
      "On the surface, that decision should be an easy one. Kane is the England captain. Only Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney have scored more goals than him in the Premier League, and he is already on Rooney\u2019s shoulder, waiting to breeze past. Kane is the sort of forward who would slot easily into any team. He can play as a focal point, he can act as a poacher, but by inclination he is a playmaker, too. He is, in essence, a false False Nine.",
      "There would, then, be no shortage of teams willing to take on his \u2014 by the standards of his peers \u2014 relatively reasonable salary. Bayern Munich has long admired Kane, in particular. Chelsea might be able to reunite him with Mauricio Pochettino. Manchester United, as things stand, has younger alternatives in mind, but if they were to prove unattainable and Kane was available, it hardly requires a great leap of imagination to suggest that might change.",
      "Any and all of his suitors could offer him not only a lavish salary but a chance at the glory that has thus far eluded him, too. Bayern, certainly, would be almost a guarantee of trophies and medals in great, heaving piles. Chelsea, like Manchester United, has on several occasions in the recent past won competitions basically by accident. Tottenham, by contrast, can offer him a statue.",
      "That, of course, is reductive. Kane\u2019s leaving Spurs would not be a simple thing. Not just for his sincere, deep-rooted attachment to the club, but for more hard-nosed, professional reasons. Staying at Tottenham \u2014 or at least in England \u2014 would almost certainly allow ",
      ", an honor that may mean as much to him as winning a couple of Bundesliga titles. Besides, his yearning for a trophy may well come to an end with England at next year\u2019s European Championship.",
      "Increasingly, though, it appears it might be his only viable choice. Back in 2018, when Kane signed his current deal, the club filmed a short video to announce the news to delighted, relieved fans. In it, Kane was depicted in the control room of ",
      ". It had not yet opened. Nobody had played there, scored there, booed their team off there, demanded the chairman\u2019s resignation there.",
      "It was easy to see it as a package-fresh vision of Tottenham\u2019s gleaming future, virgin and unsullied, a place of nothing but promise. Kane, having committed the prime of his career to the club \u2014 his club \u2014 saw only the potential. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to keep on the train,\u201d he said, possibly misunderstanding the theme of the video, \u201cand see where it can go.\u201d",
      "Initially, of course, it stayed on track. A year later, Spurs had made the Champions League final; Kane was playing for his childhood club and gracing the grandest stage European soccer can offer. Tottenham felt agonizingly close to becoming the final member of the Premier League\u2019s dominant triumvirate, alongside Manchester City and Liverpool.",
      "That was not quite what happened.",
      "In the summer when Kane signed his new contract, as Pochettino encouraged Levy to \u201cbe brave and take risks,\u201d Tottenham did not sign a single new player. Eventually, that lack of reinforcements proved telling. Spurs\u2019 form dipped. Pochettino was fired, a few months after leading it in the biggest game in the club\u2019s history.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho replaced him. Results briefly got better, then got worse again. He was fired a few days before a cup final. The club spent months without a manager, and then appointed Nuno Espirito Santo out of, well, desperation, really. It was not a success. He left, too.",
      "Antonio Conte stepped in, complained long and loud about so many subjects that it became obvious his real gripe was with the indignity of coaching Spurs. In March, he finally talked himself out of a job. His former assistant was appointed the caretaker replacement. The man in charge of finding his long-term replacement was banned from soccer. Spurs duly conceded five goals in 20 minutes at Newcastle.",
      "All that time, the club\u2019s playing squad \u2014 the one that had brought Spurs to such prominence that the club was invited to be part of the European Super League, an insult that it seemed to regard as a compliment \u2014 has been decaying. Tottenham\u2019s reputational stock, its appeal to potential recruits, has been tumbling.",
      "It had taken years of painstaking work, not least from Levy, to turn Spurs into a meaningful force in England and Europe. It took about two seasons for it all to unravel completely.",
      "Once more, there will be a new manager this summer. The current front-runner, Julian Nagelsmann, seems perfectly tailored to what the club needs: still nauseatingly young, but possessed of considerable experience; keen to rehabilitate his image, so unlikely to feel Tottenham is lucky to have him; a purveyor of bright, attractive soccer; the owner of ",
      ".",
      "Levy would doubtless hope that Nagelsmann\u2019s appointment would be enough to convince Kane of the club\u2019s seriousness, its ambition, its attractiveness. To believe that, though, the striker would have to ignore everything else he has seen in the five years since he signed his contract. All of the disappointments. All of the missed opportunities. All of the glaring strategic errors. Spurs might get the right manager. There is no evidence to suggest it will provide him with the players or the time or the environment he needs to succeed.",
      "Kane\u2019s statue outside the stadium that was supposed to represent the club\u2019s transformation should not be dependent on whether he remains at Tottenham in perpetuity. He has already given the club more than enough to make the case for a monument in his honor. He has fulfilled his side of the bargain. He has lived up to his promise.",
      "The same cannot be said for Spurs. Kane knows where this train is going; or, more pertinently, he knows where it is not. It will hardly fill him with glee, but he will know, without doubt, that this is his stop.",
      "Tottenham\u2019s players volunteering to reimburse those fans who had made the long journey to Newcastle \u2014 only to see their hapless, witless team fall 5-0 behind after 21 minutes \u2014 for the price of their tickets is a gesture rooted in the very finest of intentions. It is humble, generous, considerate. It speaks extremely well of them. It is, without question, A Nice Thing To Do.",
      "Sadly, it is also completely wrongheaded. Newcastle is a long way from London, certainly by British standards. Depending on your preferred unit of measurement, it is 280 miles; three hours (at best) and your life savings by train; or two and a half weeks on the country\u2019s traffic-clogged, potholed and pit-scarred roads by car.",
      "Throw in the price of the ticket, and those Spurs fans would have committed a couple of hundred pounds and many hours of their lives to attend the game. That the players then turned in what must rank as one of the most inept performances of any club in the Premier League era must be galling to the point of offensive. That some of those fans should have gone public with a demand for refunds is an understandable reflex.",
      "Unfortunately, that is not how sport is meant to work. A ticket to a sporting event is not a guarantee of satisfaction. There is a chance, when you go to see your team or your favorite athlete play, that they will lose. There is a slim chance, too, that they will be humiliated.",
      "That is the risk that you take. The ticket gets you access to a sporting event, one in which the outcome and the nature of it is uncertain by definition. To expect or to demand a minimum standard of performance or your money back is, on one level, to miss the point of the entire exercise.",
      "Fan, we are told frequently, should not be a synonym for customer. The entrenched loyalty of the supporter should not be taken for granted, should not monetized, should not be milked for revenue. But that precious bond, between fan and team, works both ways. You buy a ticket for a game to support your team regardless of what happens. It is an act of hope, not expectation.",
      "That interpretation has withered, at least in part, because of the attitude of the clubs themselves; it should be no surprise that fans should start to behave as customers when they are treated as such. Customers demand a refund when their hopes are dashed. In any sport, though, that is just part of the deal.",
      "Arsenal has at last succumbed to cold, harsh economic reality. The Premier League, really, should make sure to send a note of thanks and a bouquet of flowers to Mikel Arteta and his players at the end of this season\u2019s campaign. It is only because of their sudden, heartening rise that English soccer has even had a veneer of competitiveness for the last 10 months.",
      "The season, though, will end as recent seasons routinely do: with Manchester City being crowned champion. Doing anything other than wildly celebrating City\u2019s success will be met, as ever, with accusations of bitterness and jealousy, of course, but then that has always been the flaw in Abu Dhabi\u2019s master plan for the sporting arm of its foreign policy. As a rule, you can either win, or you can be loved. Rarely, if ever, do the two go together.",
      "Elsewhere in Europe, though, things are a little more uplifting. This newsletter makes no bones about the fact that it is desperate to see Napoli win Serie A \u2014 perhaps as soon as this weekend \u2014 if only to answer, once and for all, the question of whether the city itself ",
      ".",
      "But Luciano Spalletti\u2019s team may not be the continent\u2019s only unexpected champion. Feyenoord is eight points clear at the top of the Dutch Eredivisie, with only four games left. Ajax, at this rate, might not qualify for the Champions League. Either Panathinaikos or AEK Athens will win the Greek Super League, dethroning Olympiacos.",
      "And, of course, Bayern Munich has kindly decided to self-detonate at just the right time to give Borussia Dortmund the chance to end Bayern\u2019s run of 10 straight domestic championships. Dortmund is a point ahead with five games left, but three of those matches are at home, and none of them against especially daunting opponents. Its young team will never have a better chance, if it can hold its nerve.",
      "Quite why this is happening is open to question: the World Cup, doubtless, has something to do with it. It may be, to some extent, because the financial might of the Premier League has had the effect of diminishing the great and the good of other domestic leagues. Whatever it is, though, it is to be welcomed, and not just by those who stand to benefit directly.",
      "An intriguing question from ",
      "to start this week. \u201cDoes Italy not qualifying for the World Cup explain the country having three teams in the Champions League quarterfinals?\u201d he asks, omitting (as I did, last week) that it also has two Europa League semifinalists and one representative still standing in the illustrious ",
      ".",
      "My answer here is a resounding possibly. It might even be a probably. As with the sudden changes at the summit of the Bundesliga and the Eredivisie, the likelihood is that there are a rich variety of factors at play, but it seems rational to suggest that the added midseason rest for the vast majority of Napoli, Inter and A.C. Milan players has not been a hindrance.",
      "The issue of how soccer might change rumbles on, too. Several of you, including ",
      ", would tweak the offside rule so that it was judged only on foot position \u2014 this seems reasonable to me \u2014 while ",
      "prefers using a player\u2019s \u201ccenter of mass,\u201d though I would suggest the length of his email might undermine his idea\u2019s viability.",
      ", on the other hand, offered at least one immortal sentence. \u201cTo hell with pleasing restless, bored teenagers,\u201d he wrote, which is a sentiment I think anyone who has ever met a teenager can get behind. \u201cThe sport\u2019s popularity is growing. There is no need to change. Stop worrying, and spend more time with your dog.\u201d",
      "My dog is very much on board with that idea, Jim: I\u2019ve been trying to get him into games for a while by explaining that I am his emotional support human, but nobody seems to be buying it.",
      "And thanks to ",
      ", enjoying the last days of summer in Buenos Aires, for directing me to a mural of Lionel Messi \u2014 clad in his beloved bisht, and clutching the World Cup \u2014 in the city\u2019s upscale Palermo district. It is, she notes, recorded on Google Maps as a \u201cplace of worship.\u201d This seems entirely fitting."

      "SACRAMENTO \u2014 The Golden State Warriors prepared for the finale of their first-round playoff series with the Sacramento Kings by gathering for an off-day film session on Saturday on an upper floor of Chase Center, their home arena in San Francisco, with a panoramic view of the bay.",
      "Coach Steve Kerr likes to stage his film sessions there when the space is available. Otherwise, he said, the team is stuck \u201cin the dungeon down below,\u201d outside its locker room. He was grateful for the open space, especially ahead of Sunday\u2019s Game 7. It was a therapeutic experience.",
      "\u201cI do think there has to be a sense of perspective,\u201d Kerr said, \u201ceven if it\u2019s just a nice view and some sunshine and a chance to breathe and relax between games. That can make a difference.\u201d",
      "Something else can make a difference, too: Stephen Curry. No one seemed more Zen on Sunday than Curry, who led the Warriors to a series-clinching, 120-100 victory by skewering the Kings in every conceivable way on his way to 50 points \u2014 ",
      ". He sank parabolic 3-pointers. He drove for layups. He toyed with defenders. And he sent scores of Kings fans streaming into the streets of Sacramento before the game had ended.",
      "\u201cSublime,\u201d Kerr said.",
      "\u201cTotal domination,\u201d Warriors forward Draymond Green said.",
      "\u201cA joy to watch,\u201d guard Klay Thompson said.",
      "Curry, Thompson and Green have spent years demolishing opponents as one of the N.B.A.\u2019s most celebrated cores. The Kings, on the other hand, were making ",
      " since 2006. They had ",
      ". The Warriors have ",
      ".",
      "\u201cIt was a great time to put it all together,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThere\u2019s still nerves and anxiousness and anticipation before a big night. But when we get out there, our experience takes over.\u201d",
      "Curry, who arrived at the Golden 1 Center in an all-black ensemble, as if dressed for a wake, shot 20 of 38 from the field and 7 of 18 from 3-point range. He also had eight rebounds and six assists.",
      "\u201cWhat an incredible all-time performance,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "Golden State, the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference, will face the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in a conference semifinal, starting in San Francisco on Tuesday. The Lakers eliminated the second-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in their first-round series on Friday.",
      "\u201cTo do this for a decade, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Kerr said of his core players. \u201cThe energy that it takes to fight off challengers year after year, and have to prepare and win games, and do it over and over \u2014 there\u2019s a reason these guys are Hall of Famers and champions.\u201d",
      "The Warriors and Kings franchises have long been based less than 100 miles apart, but for much of the past decade they have produced very different brands of basketball \u2014 opposite brands of basketball, in fact.",
      "As the Warriors busied themselves by winning championships (four), playing in N.B.A. finals (six) and re-engineering the way basketball is played thanks to the Splash Brothers (Curry and Thompson), the Kings spent the past decade-plus scuffling through a desert of futility that had them bordering on irrelevance.",
      "Their overhaul began last season when they acquired Sabonis, an All-Star center, in a deal with Indiana. It continued over the off-season when they signed the reserve guard Malik Monk in free agency, traded with Atlanta for Kevin Huerter and hired Mike Brown, one of Kerr\u2019s assistants, as their coach.",
      "Sure enough, led by De\u2019Aaron Fox, their All-Star point guard, the Kings went 48-34 during the regular season, christening each victory by shooting a beam of purple light from the roof of their arena. \u201c",
      ", helping to bury \u2014 if not completely erase \u2014 the dysfunction of years past.",
      "On Saturday night, ahead of Game 7, Brown dined at a Sacramento-area restaurant with his partner\u2019s son. A small parade of young boys approached their table to ask Brown some incisive questions about the team\u2019s players. They asked about Sabonis\u2019s right thumb, which he had fractured during the regular season. They asked about Fox\u2019s broken left index finger. They asked if the first-year forward Keegan Murray would be ready to shoot in Game 7.",
      "\u201cAnd one of the kids was a Warriors fan, so they started ribbing him,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not! No, I\u2019m not!\u2019 But he had a Golden State Warriors hat on.\u201d",
      "More than anything, Brown said, he could sense their excitement \u2014 a type of postseason anticipation that Sacramento had not experienced in years.",
      "As for the Warriors, their roster seemed to constantly be in a state of flux during the regular season. Curry injured a shoulder and sprained an ankle. Andrew Wiggins, their starting small forward, left the team in mid-February citing personal reasons and missed the final 25 games of the regular season.",
      "Kerr, meanwhile, struggled to strike a balance between securing a playoff berth (no sure thing) and developing young players like Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga and James Wiseman, who was eventually traded midseason. Ultimately, Kerr kept leaning on the usual suspects \u2014 Curry, Thompson and Green, a defensive stalwart \u2014 as the postseason came into sharper focus.",
      "The Warriors welcomed Wiggins\u2019s return for the start of the playoffs, then lost their first two games, which presented a new obstacle: Curry, Thompson and Green found themselves trailing in a playoff series, 2-0, for the first time in their careers. Perhaps they needed a fresh challenge.",
      "On Sunday, Sacramento led, 58-56, at halftime, which is when Golden State \u2014 a team known for years for ",
      " \u2014 went about its usual business. Curry sank a 3-pointer. He sliced through a mix of defenders to scoop in a layup. He drained a floater.",
      "\u201cYou can tell when he\u2019s locked in or laser-focused,\u201d Green said.",
      "By the time Kevon Looney, the team\u2019s starting center, scored off an offensive rebound, Golden State led by 9.",
      "The prevailing mood of the Kings fans inside the arena was not necessarily panic, but there was certainly angst. Curry had already been in this sort of situation on so many occasions, and none of it \u2014 not the hostile environment, not the pressure of a Game 7 \u2014 appeared to bother him. In fact, he was feeding off it.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the best players in the history of the game,\u201d Kerr said, adding: \u201cThe resilience and the work that goes into that, the focus, it\u2019s incredible to watch.",
      "As Golden State\u2019s lead swelled in the fourth quarter, the crowd\u2019s angst turned to resignation.",
      "Looney ",
      " with a double-double, 11 points and 21 rebounds.",
      "\u201cThe guy is a flat-out winner and a machine,\u201d Kerr said.",
      "The stage, though, belonged to Curry, which was no surprise. Another one awaits against the Lakers. After Sunday\u2019s game, Curry was asked if anyone could stop him.",
      "\u201cHopefully, we never find out,\u201d he said."

      "The only thing in doubt after 10 laps, really, was which Red Bull would win the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Sunday. But even that, by the end, was no contest.",
      "Sergio P\u00e9rez outclassed both the field and his teammate, Max Verstappen, to win on Sunday in Baku. The finish was P\u00e9rez\u2019s second victory of the season \u2014 Verstappen has won the other two events \u2014 and was the third time in four races that Red Bull\u2019s cars had crossed the line first and second.",
      "The results also left little doubt about Red Bull\u2019s advantage over every other team in Formula 1 this season, when it has been fastest in practice, in qualifying and on Sundays. But the contest also set the stage for a long, hot summer of racing between the two Red Bull drivers; P\u00e9rez now trails Verstappen by only six points in the season standings.",
      "\u201cWell done, guys, we dominated this weekend,\u201d P\u00e9rez told his team over the radio after his victory. \u201cWe are in the fight.\u201d",
      "Charles Leclerc of Ferrari grabbed a consolation prize by finishing third, just holding off Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin. It was Leclerc\u2019s first podium finish of the year, but he \u2014 just like everyone else \u2014 was well beaten by Red Bull. Again.",
      "For the second consecutive race, Formula 1 narrowly avoided tragedy when people came onto the track before the race had ended.",
      "In Australia it had been fans who encroached, slipping through gaps in the fencing to gain access to the track even as the cars were still racing at full speed. On Sunday, the scare came in pit lane, where photographers, crew members and safety officials who had come out of the garage area to watch P\u00e9rez and Verstappen cross the finish line were sent scrambling when Alpine\u2019s Esteban Ocon entered the area.",
      "The photographers were gathering in front of the area in pit lane where the podium finishers park their cars before the awards ceremony, and team mechanics \u2014 including those from Red Bull \u2014 were celebrating on the pit wall.",
      "But the race, at that point, was not over. Ocon\u2019s stop was not optional if he wanted to claim the points earned from his finish. Drivers must complete at least one pit stop to change tires during a race, and he had not been in yet.",
      "Organizers of the Australian Grand Prix opened an investigation after the track incursions in Melbourne, which one acknowledged \u201c",
      ".\u201d But those appeared to be the fans\u2019 fault.",

      "Red Bull had already told Verstappen to pit when the safety car emerged, allowing P\u00e9rez \u2014 who had slipped into the lead \u2014 to essentially save time by making his stop while the field was crawling around the track, and came out of the pit with the lead and a set of fresh tires. (Verstappen, by going in early, had lost much more ground and wound up playing catch-up all day.)",

      "Moroz, 44, had been running since he was a child. He and his family live in Irpin, just west of Kyiv, and \u201cit was impossible not to run,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ",
      " last year, Moroz would start his day by running: at sunrise through a nearby forest before going to work\u00a0at large construction sites, where he was a project manager.",
      "Then war arrived.",
      "Moroz joined the military in late March 2022, after watching Russian soldiers attack Irpin, and became a platoon commander. On Sept. 14, he and his unit were hit by a rocket in the Kherson region. If not for Polish doctors and paramedics, he would have died, he said, but both his legs were amputated below the knee. At first, he couldn\u2019t imagine being able to stand again, he said.",
      "While in a hospital in Mykolaiv, he watched a documentary on YouTube about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and the way the city and running community had come back stronger in 2014.",
      "The movie gave him a goal: Run the Boston Marathon, which was then six months away.",
      "Social media facilitated a key connection as he began his pursuit. Nadiia Osmankina, a Ukrainian who came to the United States a year ago for the Boston Marathon and stayed because of the war, saw his story and reached out to him. Running Boston changed her life, she said, and she wanted Moroz to get that same opportunity.",
      "She had connections with both the Ukrainian Running Club in New York City and the president of a foundation, Revived Soldiers Ukraine, that helps wounded Ukrainian service members. The foundation\u2019s president, Iryna Vashchuk, had been a professional runner and was born in Irpin.",
      "The foundation has a center in Orlando, Fla., where soldiers are fitted for prosthetics. They were able to provide Moroz with both regular walking prosthetics, for daily life, and a specialized type used for running, which are carbon fiber curves that have rubber treads around the edges of the \u201cfeet.\u201d",
      "Moroz arrived late last month and figured that while he was in the United States, he could run some races. The Ukrainian Running Club has a big presence at many races staged by the New York Road Runners, the organizer of the New York City Marathon, and they connected the Road Runners and Moroz so he could pick a race.",
      "But becoming accustomed to new prosthetics, especially running blades, isn\u2019t like slipping on a new pair of sneakers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different muscle memory, especially for above-the-knee amputees,\u201d said Mary Johnson, who had one leg amputated above the knee after a traumatic injury.",
      "You have to trust that your foot will hit the ground underneath you where you expect, or you\u2019ll land on the ground, she said.",
      "The Central Park race in early April came just a week after Moroz had arrived in the United States. By then, reality had set in: He wouldn\u2019t be competing on his new running blades. Still, he was back out there on a racecourse.",
      "Organizers allowed Moroz and Osmankina to start 10 minutes early so he wouldn\u2019t be jostled in the crowded corrals. Except for walking across the starting line, this first race would be in a wheelchair. Some runners from the Ukrainian club cheered at a spot on the course.",
      "Just after he finished, Moroz was already looking ahead to his next race: Boston, in two weeks. Not the marathon, but the five-kilometer race the Boston Athletic Association puts on two days earlier. This year, it fell on the 10th anniversary of the ",
      ". Even with his slow early progress, Moroz thought he might be able to run on his new blades in Boston.",
      "Two days before the race, Moroz was practicing\u00a0on his new\u00a0walking prosthetics in Orlando in a parking lot. The fit still wasn\u2019t quite right, he said. Small changes, even drinking a glass of water, altered how they would fit. That\u2019s not unusual for amputees. The doctors would tweak one thing and he would try it, and then they would adjust again.",
      "Sean Karpf, who was wounded while serving in the U.S. Army and lost part of one leg below the knee, said that during the first two to three years after his injury, he had needed adjustments every four to six months because of the changes in his residual limb \u2014 not unusual for amputees.",
      "In the United States, medical insurance doesn\u2019t cover adaptive sports equipment, which is not deemed medically necessary and can be expensive. A running blade can cost $12,000 to $15,000. Above-the-knee amputees also need a knee joint, which costs more.",
      "While the Department of Veterans Affairs generally will cover the cost of that type of equipment for American troops injured during their service, the wait can be as long as 18 months. Americans who aren\u2019t in the military often rely on fund-raising efforts or grants through nonprofit groups. Johnson got her running prosthetic through the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides grants for adaptive equipment and camps and clinics for people to learn adaptive sports.",
      "Moroz finally got his running blades a few days before his Boston race, but he wasn\u2019t ready to run on them, so he instead used his walking prosthetics for the 5K event. After the race, he put on the running blades for photos at the finish line with Osmankina. He couldn\u2019t stand, much less walk, without leaning on someone for balance. When Osmankina stepped away, Moroz nearly fell.",
      "Still, seven months and a day after Moroz had been carried from the battlefield by Polish medics, his life in danger, he ran for the first time, in Boston. It wasn\u2019t ",
      ", as he had imagined, but that didn\u2019t matter. He was running.",
      "Soon, Ukraine will have more capacity to help people injured in the war instead of relying on European and American medical centers. ",
      ", an organization focused on helping Ukrainians heal from traumatic injuries sustained in the war, is retrofitting an old military hospital in Lviv from the Soviet Union\u00a0era, said Dr. David Crandell, who is the medical director of the amputee center at a rehabilitation hospital in Boston and part of the World Health Organization\u2019s technical working group on rehabilitation for Ukraine. Next month, Unbroken expects to open the former hospital as a center focused on amputee and post-traumatic stress care.",
      "Demand is high. The First Union Hospital in Lviv is receiving 25 to 100 new trauma patients each day, Crandell said. He estimates that the country will have to accommodate 5,000 to 6,000 new amputees because of the war.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine what Boston saw at the Boston Marathon, every single day for a year,\u201d Crandell said.",
      "This race, which Moroz had been inspired to run only months earlier from his hospital bed, began with Osmankina riding in the wheelchair, holding a flag, as Moroz pushed her. A little farther on, a slippery patch on the road made him slide, and before the second turn on the course, they had switched positions. Osmankina pushed Moroz, his feet lifted so the heels of his everyday prostheses wouldn\u2019t catch on the ground. He lifted his arms up, encouraging the spectators who lined the course to cheer louder.",
      "They arrived to fans. Andriy Boyko, a Ukrainian who lives in Melrose, Mass., a suburb north of Boston, showed up with his family to cheer from the sidelines. Moroz later said he had heard many people cheering for him and for Ukraine during the race, which he had not expected.",
      "As they approached the end of the race, Moroz and Osmankina switched places again. Moroz ran, pushing his guide over the finish line.",
      "The marathon would be there when he was ready. As he spoke, a good 20 minutes after he had crossed the finish line, his hand still trembled from the adrenaline.",
      "\u201cIt might be I will not sleep tonight,\u201d he said."

      "An ambitious redevelopment plan, however, would have the stadium razed and replaced with a modern facility. The plan has come under intense scrutiny from disparate groups that include fans of baseball history, followers of the country\u2019s rugby history and conservationists who are concerned about how the various projects would affect the Jingu Gaien district, a historic green space that features century-old trees provided by the industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi, known by some as the father of Japanese capitalism.",
      "\u201cThis is like building skyscrapers in the middle of Central Park in New York,\u201d Mikiko Ishikawa, an emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo, ",

      "In the redevelopment plan, Meiji Jingu and a neighboring venue, the\u00a0Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium, which opened in 1947 and was used as a soccer venue during the 1964 Summer Olympics, would be demolished in phases. The new versions of the two stadiums would swap locations.",
      "The goal of the project is to modernize the various facilities involved, which are far out of date, and to create a better environment for moving between the stadiums. Open spaces would be created and enlarged and the hope is that it would be a hub for tourism and for people to enjoy the various sporting events that would be held there. The entire project, which includes skyscrapers and a hotel, is scheduled to be completed by 2036.",
      "At that point it will have been just over 100 years since a lineup of M.L.B. stars played five games at Meiji Jingu during a tour of Japan in 1934. Ruth put on a show by hitting 13 home runs, five of them in Meiji Jingu. The ripples of that tour are still felt, as the Japanese team compiled to take on the Americans went on to form the Yomiuri Giants, a team that would dominate N.P.B.",

      "In response to the criticisms, the developers have adjusted the plan for fewer trees to be felled, but activists have said that the trees\u2019 complex roots systems could still be compromised and that the amount of sunlight the trees receive will be affected by the new surrounding buildings.",

      "Chess is considered the ultimate game of cold, logical calculation, but it is also a game of passion and, at the highest level, of nerves. That was clear on Sunday when the world championship match in Astana, Kazakhstan, ended with Ding Liren, the new champion, sitting at a board by himself in a darkened theater, his head in his hand, crying tears of joy.",
      "Ding\u2019s victory came in a tense and gripping rapid-play finale against Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia, and only after three weeks of slower-paced games that had failed to produce a winner. The result made Ding the first man from China, a rising power in chess, to hold the world championship, simultaneously preventing Russia from reclaiming it.",
      "Ding\u2019s match against Nepomniachtchi was decided in a series of four tiebreaker games made necessary after the regulation portion of the match, 14 grueling classical games, ended in a tie. Each player won three games in the regulation portion; the other eight ended in draws.",
      "The tiebreakers, all played Sunday, were faster games in which each player had 25 minutes at the start, with 10 seconds added every move. The first three games were draws, but each one was highly tense and hard-fought.",
      "In Game 4, Nepomniachtchi, playing white, repeated the opening he had tried in the second game of the tiebreakers. On move 13, he tried a new idea, but Ding \u2014 capitalizing on its defects \u2014 soon seized the upper hand.",
      "Still, the game seemed headed for a draw when Nepomniachtchi, with more time left on his clock, decided to make the game more complicated to see if he could force Ding into a mistake. Instead, it was Nepomniachtchi who cracked, making critical errors that allowed Ding to take control. Nepomniachtchi resigned on Move 68.",
      "It was the first and only time that Ding led in the championship match. He earned $1.1 million for his victory, while Nepomniachtchi won $900,000 as the runner-up.",
      "Ding\u2019s victory sent waves through Chinese social media late in the evening, with a hashtag related to the new champion quickly amassing over 10 million views on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform. Chinese users, full of pride and relief after three anxiety-filled weeks, celebrated the championship even as some admitted to their ignorance of how to play chess. Nearly all agreed on the weight of the moment.",
      "\u201cWe Chinese have stepped atop chess\u2019s highest stage,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cDing Liren is the pride of China.\u201d",
      "The match had been overshadowed from the start by the absence of Magnus Carlsen, the Norwegian grandmaster who had held the world title since 2013. Carlsen voluntarily chose to relinquish the crown last July because he had grown weary and bored of preparing for the matches, a process that takes months.",
      "Carlsen has long been critical of the length of the games for what is known as the classical world championship. Each one can take hours and, particularly in recent years, when players have been able to prepare beforehand with computers, they often end without a decisive result. (For example, Game 14 on Saturday, the day before the tiebreakers, had lasted nearly seven hours and ended in a draw.)",
      "For fans, and potential sponsors, that can make the biggest event in chess less exciting. The match in Astana did not have that problem \u2014 nearly half of the games ended in victories \u2014 but that did not change Carlsen\u2019s opinion.",
      "In ",
      " on April 28 on NRK, the largest media company in Norway, Carlsen said: \u201cThere is a lot of talk now this world championship proves that \u2018classical chess is doing well\u2019 and all that. I have to admit that I don\u2019t buy that at all.\u201d",
      "He explained that Nepomniachtchi and Ding took many chances in the beginning phases of the games in their championship match, but that was atypical. In his matches, Carlsen said, that did not happen because his opponents were afraid of him and tried to limit risk. The result, he argued, was that the games were not interesting.",
      "Hikaru Nakamura, a five-time United States champion, suggested on a recent livestream that it did not matter who won the Ding-Nepomniachtchi showdown.",
      "\u201cThe world champion is not going to be treated as a world champion,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if Nepomniachtchi wins. I don\u2019t care if Ding wins. Both of them will be very deserving of winning the match. But that will not make them the world champion in anybody\u2019s book.\u201d",
      "Ding\u2019s triumph was significant for both China and Russia. Russians have dominated chess for most of the last century, partly a legacy of the Soviet Union, which promoted supremacy in the game as proof of its superiority over the West.",
      "China, rather than embracing the game for similar reasons, rejected it because of its\u00a0popularity\u00a0in what\u00a0the country\u00a0viewed as the \u201cdecadent\u201d West. For eight years during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, playing the game was banned.",
      "The perception of chess in China began to change after Xie Jun won the women\u2019s world championship in 1991, becoming the first non-Russian, non-Georgian woman to hold the title. That sparked a frenzy of state-sponsored activities designed to cultivate elite players, a project collectively known as the\u00a0Big Dragon Plan. Chinese schools created chess clubs, and training institutions and tournaments proliferated. Last year, the Chinese government unveiled a new 10-year plan to develop the country\u2019s next generation of prodigies.",
      "China\u2019s commitment has already yielded results. A succession of Chinese players\u00a0after Xie won the women\u2019s world championship, allowing China to hold the title for most of the last 32 years. The current titleholder is Ju Wenjun, who became champion in 2018. She will face a compatriot, Lei Tingjie, in a match in July, ensuring that the women\u2019s title will stay in Chinese hands.",
      "China has also produced some very good men\u2019s players in recent years, with half a dozen rising into the top 20 in the world rankings at one\u00a0point or another. But Ding has been far and away the best of them.",
      "Born in Wenzhou a year after Xie\u2019s victory, he was taught to play chess by his father, a chess aficionado, when he was 4. He began to compete in tournaments soon after and won his first national title when he was\u00a05. He rose to international prominence in 2009, at 16, when he became China\u2019s domestic champion. He won the title again in 2011 and 2012.",
      "He has been ranked as high as No. 2 in the world and is the only Chinese player to ever achieve a rating, the points system used to classify players, of more than 2,800.",
      "Ding\u2019s path to the title was littered with obstacles. The pandemic and China\u2019s isolation had forced him to stop competing, but in order to play in the candidates\u2019 tournament last year \u2014 a requirement to select a challenger for the championship match \u2014 he had to have played a minimum number of competitions. The Chinese Chess Federation stepped in to organize three tournaments early last year to allow him to satisfy the requirement.",
      "At the candidates\u2019 tournament, which was held last June and July in Madrid, Ding finished second behind Nepomniachtchi. Normally, that would have only qualified Nepomniachtchi to play for the title against Carlsen. But after Carlsen declined, Ding became the other challenger.",
      "The loss was a crushing one for Nepomniachtchi. Born the same year as Carlsen and often called Russia\u2019s answer to the Norwegian grandmaster, he had been overshadowed by his rival for years. Nepomniachtchi played Carlsen for the world title in 2021 in Dubai, but after getting off to a good start by drawing the first five games, he collapsed and lost in one of the most lopsided results in the history of the event. This year\u2019s match, with Carlsen having stepped aside, was a golden opportunity for him.",
      "In the news conference afterward, with members of Ding\u2019s family and Xie, the first Chinese women\u2019s champion, looking on, Ding was asked if the match was one of the crowning moments of his life. He struggled to explain his feelings. \u201cThe match,\u201d he finally answered, \u201creflected the deepest of my soul.\u201d",

And the Green Bay Packers, playing the role of a merry divorc\u00e9 post-Aaron Rodgers trade, dallied with new playmakers.",
      "This year\u2019s N.F.L. draft provided an opportunity for some of the league\u2019s most fascinating decision makers and franchises to truly express themselves. Here are the teams that made clever moves, and a few players who came up a bit short.",
      "The Eagles should not be able to do the things they do.",
      "A team that won 14 games and reached the Super Bowl last season should not have a top 10 pick in the next draft. That team should not have the opportunity to draft both Jalen Carter, possibly the most talented player in his class, and his Georgia defensive linemate Nolan Smith, who produced astounding workout results at the scouting combine.",
      "That team should not have later been able to add four more potential starters: offensive lineman Tyler Steen, a steady performer for Vanderbilt and Alabama; Illinois safety Sydney Brown, who intercepted six passes for one of the nation\u2019s best defenses in 2022; cornerback Kelee Ringo, yet another member of Georgia\u2019s back-to-back national championship teams; and, through a trade, the veteran running back D\u2019Andre Swift (Georgia, again), who scored eight touchdowns last year for the Detroit Lions.",
      "Finally, a team nursing a Super Bowl hangover should not have been able to lock its star quarterback, Jalen Hurts, into a reported five-year, $255 million contract extension before the draft. Such a team would normally be salary-cap strapped, and such contracts are supposed to be preceded by months of melodrama.",
      "The Eagles accomplished all of those things thanks to the Wolf of Broad Street wizardry of Roseman. Among other feats, Roseman acquired the ninth overall pick that the Eagles used on Carter (",
      ") as part of a complex web of trades dating back to 2021; stuffed the bulk of Hurts\u2019s compensation into future balloon payments so the Eagles could retain other core veterans; and engineered the trades that landed the team the Ringo pick and Swift as a Saturday aperitif.",
      "Other teams may have done more than the Eagles to improve their rosters in this weekend\u2019s N.F.L. draft. No team, however, did more to improve its chances of winning next year\u2019s Super Bowl. Of course, it helps that the Eagles, thanks to their draft-weekend brilliance in past years, did not have many improvements left to make.",
      "One of the fundamental tenets of football analytics is that running backs and linebackers are bad investments in the first round of the draft: There\u2019s a surplus of talent at those positions, running back careers are short and linebackers have a limited role in the pass-happy modern N.F.L.",
      "The Lions, coached by Campbell, the archetypal tough guy, gave the analytics community an atomic wedgie in the first round by drafting both Alabama running back Jahmyr Gibbs and Iowa linebacker Jack Campbell (no relation to Dan). Gibbs was not even the first running back selected \u2014 the Atlanta Falcons chose Bijan Robinson of Texas eighth overall \u2014 and Jack Campbell is the type of 249-pound run-stopping sledgehammer that has been on the verge of extinction for years.",
      "The selection of Iowa tight end Sam LaPorta early in the second round \u2014 tight end is considered another position of low marginal value \u2014 further fueled the analytics nerds\u2019 rage.",
      "Tempers cooled when the Lions selected Alabama defensive back Brian Branch, a first-round talent according to many experts, with the 45th overall pick. The team then selected Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker with the 68th pick. Hooker might have been a first-round selection if he were not already older than many N.F.L. starters (he turned 25 in January) and if he had not torn an anterior cruciate ligament in November.",
      "Suddenly, the Lions\u2019 efforts looked less like a tipsy father-in-law\u2019s fantasy draft and more like a master class in resource management.",
      "A second dictate of football analytics stresses that scouting is so imprecise that acquiring an abundance of extra draft picks is a far better tactic than trading up to target one coveted prospect. The Lions received a bundle of picks from the Los Angeles Rams ",
      ", and they acquired an extra second-round pick from the Arizona Cardinals by trading down before selecting Gibbs. As a result, they came away from Friday night with several potential starters and a possible franchise quarterback. They just did so in an unusual order.",
      "The 2023 draft class was glutted with shifty, speedy receivers who wouldn\u2019t weigh 180 pounds even after a never-ending pasta bowl. It turned out that N.F.L. teams were lukewarm about such prospects.",
      "Receiver Jordan Addison of Southern California, who weighed 173 pounds at the scouting combine, did go in the first round, joining the Minnesota Vikings with the 23rd overall pick. However, other receivers who had first-round reputations but weighed less than 180 pounds were forced to wait until the third round: Jalin Hyatt of Tennessee (177 pounds, Giants, 73rd overall), Josh Downs of North Carolina (171 pounds, Indianapolis Colts, 79th overall) and Nathaniel Dell of Houston (just 165 pounds, Houston Texans, 69th overall).",
      "Bigger but less heralded receivers like Jonathan Mingo of Mississippi (220 pounds, Carolina Panthers, 39th overall) and Rashee Rice of Southern Methodist (204 pounds, Kansas City Chiefs, 55th overall), however, heard their names called earlier than expected.",
      "Boston College receiver Zay Flowers bulked up to 182 pounds and joined the Baltimore Ravens with the 22nd overall pick. When it comes to reaching N.F.L. scouting benchmarks, an extra helping of smothered hash browns can go a long way.",
      "Even so, N.F.L. teams are more willing to invest in sub-180 pound receivers now than they once were. Three such prospects were selected in the first two rounds of the 2022 draft, but their fortunes illustrate the upside and downside of drafting receivers the size of high school soccer players. Jameson Williams of the Lions missed most of the season with a collegiate injury and ",
      ". Jahan Dotson of the Washington Commanders flashed brilliance but missed five midseason games with a hamstring injury. Wan\u2019Dale Robinson of the Giants began to establish himself as an elusive catch-and-run threat before suffering an A.C.L. injury.",
      "If Hyatt and Robinson can stay healthy, not only will the Giants have a dynamic, unpredictable offense, but they will also save a little on grocery bills.",
      "Some teams draft the best available athletes. Others draft for need. The Packers may be the first N.F.L. team to draft for spite. Having finally ",
      " at the start of the week, the Packers assembled a draft class that appeared tailored to make Rodgers jealous.",
      "The Packers added three pass catchers on Friday evening: Oregon State tight end Luke Musgrave (42nd overall), Michigan State receiver Jayden Reed (50th) and South Dakota State tight end Tucker Kraft (78th). The Packers chose Musgrave, a 6-foot-6 target of the type Rodgers prefers, one spot ahead of the Jets, using one of the picks they acquired in the Rodgers trade.",
      "The Packers were depleted at tight end, and they needed to rebuild their offense for their new starting quarterback, Jordan Love, so of course they did not really select three versatile playmakers as the football equivalent of wearing a white dress to an ex-spouse\u2019s wedding.",
      "Still, ",
      " \u2014 their picks included defensive end Will McDonald IV, center Joe Tippmann and offensive tackle Carter Warren, who are fine additions but not headline-grabbers \u2014 while the Packers cheerfully embraced a future without Rodgers.",

      "About five years ago, the head of Amazon Studios, Jennifer Salke, called Anthony and Joe Russo with an idea for a different kind of franchise. It would start with an American-made show then eventually expand into multiple other series, set and produced in other countries and filmed in other languages, all connected within the same storytelling universe on Prime Video.",
      "The Russo Brothers were intrigued. As linchpins of the Marvel empire, having directed two Avengers movies and two Captain America movies, they knew all about international reach; Marvel, after all, reaps much of its enormous profit abroad. And they soon came up with the right vehicle: a fast-paced spy thriller that jets around the world, as such stories already tend to do.",
      "The result, or at least the first step, is the six-part first season of \u201cCitadel,\u201d debuting Friday. The brisk, often violent action drama is about a global spy network, also called Citadel, charged with keeping the world\u2019s peace, often through unpeaceful means. At the center are two agents and smoldering former lovers, Nadia Sinh (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) and Mason Kane (Richard Madden), who must fight to save the organization after a nefarious enemy spy group, known as Manticore, nearly wipes Citadel off the map.",
      "But the flagship American series is just the start: Production has wrapped on the Italian \u201cCitadel,\u201d starring Matilda De Angelis (\u201cThe Undoing\u201d), and it is already underway on the Indian \u201cCitadel,\u201d featuring the Bollywood star Varun Dhawan. For the Russo brothers, who are executive producers on all three series, the franchise was the logical next step in their world-building (and world-spanning) vision.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had the good fortune of being able to tell stories that travel around the globe, and we\u2019ve seen the effect that those can have on audiences,\u201d Anthony Russo said, sitting beside his brother during a video interview last week from London. \u201cBut those were Hollywood-centric narratives that traveled. The idea that we could create a story that not only traveled around the world but was created around the world seemed like a very exciting movement forward.\u201d",
      "It is an audaciously ambitious plan, a play for world influence that the warring spies of \u201cCitadel\u201d might recognize. Some of the production challenges are already evident.",
      "\u201cIt really is like riding a bucking bronco,\u201d Joe Russo said. \u201cNew ideas are always developing because Italy and India are in different timelines of production.\u201d As the other two productions emerge with new ideas, he added, \u201cit\u2019s important for us to adjust and make sure that our Easter eggs and our plot threads are all feeding correctly into future stories.\u201d",
      "David Weil (\u201cHunters\u201d) replaced the original showrunner, Josh Applebaum, during production. (The Indian and Italian productions have different showrunners.) According to ",
      ", reshoots pushed the cost of \u201cCitadel\u201d to more than $200 million, which would make it one of the most expensive series ever made. (Amazon did not respond to multiple queries about the show\u2019s budget.)",
      "The franchise\u2019s international ambitions are apparent immediately in early episodes of the U.S. production. Shooting locations abroad for the first season include London, Morocco and Valencia, Spain. Within the first 10 minutes of the series, Chopra Jonas and Madden banter and bicker in Mandarin, Italian, Spanish and German, a multilingual way to immediately indicate these characters have a past.",
      "Casting was also a crucial part of the international equation. Chopra Jonas is one of India\u2019s most famous actresses, and she has also made a name in the United States (including in the ABC drama \u201cQuantico\u201d). Madden, who played Robb Stark in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d is Scottish. The British actress Lesley Manville (\u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d) plays the ruthless Manticore head, Dahlia Archer, who also happens to be the British ambassador to the United States.",
      "The global orientation was a big part of the appeal for Chopra Jonas.",
      "\u201cAs someone who worked in the Indian film industry, I always wanted our Hindi language movies to transcend borders and move into other diasporas,\u201d she said last week in a video interview. \u201cYou want your movies to always travel.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201c\u2018Citadel\u2019 is giving an opportunity to filmmakers around the world to play in the same sand pit and have the same opportunities to tell their stories.\u201d",
      "Like \u201cThe Bourne Identity\u201d (2002), the first installment in the long-running film series based on the Robert Ludlum novels, \u201cCitadel\u201d turns on a case of amnesia. When, in the pilot, Mason and Nadia nearly die in a fiery train crash, their caustic handler, Bernard (Stanley Tucci), \u201cbackstops\u201d them, wiping their memories clean. Mason then spends the next eight years living as another person, Kyle, with a wife (played by the Australian actress Ashleigh Cummings) and young daughter (Caoilinn Springall) and no recollection of his life as a superspy.",
      "Kyle is a nice guy. Mason, not so much. When circumstances conspire to make Mason necessary to Citadel again, the reverse transition makes for a thorny process.",
      "\u201cThey share a soul,\u201d Madden said. \u201cMason is inherently selfish and damaged. Kyle is the opposite of that. He\u2019s surrounded by love. As the show goes on, you get to see more of Mason and how much he actually is craving love and intimacy with someone.\u201d",
      "Here, too, the inherent qualities of the spy genre provided opportunities for deeper exploration. Spies, after all, have no fixed identities: They are many different things to many different people. \u201cCitadel\u201d adds a wrinkle to these already-blurred lines, creating characters whose divided selves go beyond expedient aliases and multiple passports.",
      "Chopra Jonas relished the questions of identity raised by the premise: \u201cHow are you going to come to terms with everything that happened in those eight years?\u201d she said. \u201cWho are you as a person now? A culmination of both of those? What kind of humanity do you retain? What about your moral compass? It\u2019s a really delicious unpacking of character.\u201d",
      "With multiple productions based in multiple countries and a narrative universe that thrives on complexity, the \u201cCitadel\u201d project has no shortage of moving parts. It can all get dizzying and demands careful management in order to keep everything coherent and on track. This, Tucci said, is an area where the Russo brothers excel.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re probably the most efficient filmmakers I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d said Tucci, who also stars in the Russo-directed sci-fi adventure movie \u201cThe Electric State,\u201d scheduled to debut on Netflix next year. \u201cThey know exactly what they want. You get in, and you do it, and they\u2019re collaborative. Then you go: \u2018OK, 6 o\u2019clock. Time to go home. Did we get everything?\u2019 And they got everything. That just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "If the opening salvos connect with audiences, the \u201cCitadel\u201d team hopes to add even more countries and more story lines to the project. If all goes as planned, \u201cCitadel\u201d could attain a reach and scope to match its namesake spy network.",
      "To Madden, it wouldn\u2019t feel right otherwise.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re trying to make a show about a spy agency that we say exists in every country in the world,\u201d he said, \u201cit only makes sense to have versions of this show from as many countries as we can.\u201d"

      "The field she began working in didn\u2019t really have a name at the time but is now called environmental graphic design. She became one of its founding figures, coming up with systems to help people navigate complex spaces, a specialty called \u201cwayfinding.\u201d",
      "Airports were a calling: In Miami, Houston, Baltimore and several dozen other cities, Ms. Doggett used color coding, symbols, uniform signage and other touches to help travelers find their way around airports that would have otherwise been more intimidating.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t envision my role as herding people,\u201d Ms. Doggett told ",

      "Jane Davis Doggett was born on Nov. 4, 1929, in Morristown, Tenn. Her father, Robert, was a paving contractor and wholesale asphalt distributor who also bred horses.

      "In 1958, she had, for an American, a rare opportunity to see Moscow, when she went there to cover the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Architects for Architectural Record magazine.",
      "The next year, she got a call from a fellow Yale graduate, Roy Harrover, who invited her to join a team designing a new airport for Memphis. He asked her to handle the graphic elements.",

      "It was the first of many airport projects for her. In Houston in the early 1970s, she faced a complicated problem that she would encounter again in large metropolitan airports: multiple terminals. She gave each its own color on signs.",
      "And she came up with another innovation: posting the color-coded signs on the roadways leading to the airport. A driver looking for, say, Terminal A would see a big, red \u201cA\u201d sign as they approached the airport \u2014 common sense now, but new then.",
      "\u201cThis makes your traffic flow work,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cBefore that, everybody was hitting brakes to read. All of this was done by this kid from Yale because I didn\u2019t know any better. I thought, Well, this ought to work.\u201d",
      "Her favorite airport assignment, she often said, was in Tampa, Fla., where she designed graphic elements of an airport that opened in 1971. As with many of her projects, one of her key contributions was based on common sense \u2014 in particular, the realization that no one in an airport is going to know which direction is north, south, east or west, especially after navigating the tangle of roads leading to the terminals.",

      " the band\u2019s best known single, from 1979, which reached No. 8 on the British indie charts. The lyrics include these lines:",
      "Live performances by the Pop Group hit with \u201csuch indomitable force and such sudden visceral rage that I could ",
      ",\u201d the musician and writer Nick Cave wrote in a tribute on his website, The Red Hand Files, after Mr. Stewart\u2019s death.",
      "Righteous fury was as intrinsic to Mr. Stewart\u2019s personality as it was to his music. \u201cMark taught me many things about life,\u201d Mr. Cave added, including the idea that \u201csleeping was a bourgeois indulgence, and that the world was one giant corporate conspiracy, and that one way to win an argument was to just never, ever stop shouting.\u201d",
      "The band scarcely made a dent commercially, but that made sense, given its contempt for all things capitalist. As Mr. Stewart put it in a 2015 interview with The Arts Desk, a culture site, \u201cThe Pop Group were really that Situationist idea of an ",

      "Mark Stewart was born in Bristol, in South West England, on Aug. 10, 1960, one of two sons of an engineer father and a mother who worked with children with learning disabilities.",
      "Bristol in the 1970s was a rough town, Mr. Stewart once said, and his towering stature \u2014 he was already 6 feet 6 inches tall as a preteen \u2014 made him a tempting potential recruit for local boot-boy gangs. But the thug\u2019s life was not for him; music was his passion \u2014 even though he and his friends considered themselves musical misfits, scouring junk shops for obscure jazz and funk records, wearing mohair sweaters inspired by the Sex Pistols and staging punk shows at a local youth center.",
      "\u201cThe local gangs really, really had it in for me,\u201d he said in the Arts Desk interview. \u201cThey wanted me to join their gangs but didn\u2019t realize I was only 12. They thought I was about 20. So they\u2019d smash all the youth club windows. I had to climb out of toilet windows.\u201d",
      "Music was a way out. \u201cIf there\u2019s not too much going on in the town you\u2019re in, ",
      ",\u201d he said in 2014 interview with Vice.",
      "Mr. Stewart formed the Pop Group in 1976 along with the band\u2019s original members: John Waddington (guitar), Simon Underwood (bass), Gareth Sager (guitar and saxophone) and Bruce Smith (drums).",
      "The band\u2019s name came from Mr. Stewart\u2019s mother. \u201cI think she said, \u2018Oh, Mark\u2019s forming a pop group,\u2019\u201d he told Vice. And at the outset, he said, \u201cwe thought we were.\u201d",
      "The band\u2019s first album, \u201cY,\u201d which was released in 1979 and produced by the British dub master Dennis Bovell, made little commercial impact.",
      "\u201cThese heavyweight journalists thought we were being deliberately obtuse,\u201d Mr. Stewart told Vice, although NME, the taste-making British music publication, called the debut \u201ca ",

      ",\u201d released the next year; it crackled with angry denunciations of Thatcher-era England. Though some dismissed it as \u201cself-righteous soapbox agitprop,\u201d the critic Simon Reynolds wrote in \u201cU.K. Post-Punk,\u201d a 2012 collection of his essays, the album, like \u201cY,\u201d came to be a considered a classic by many.",

      "The band broke up not long after the second album\u2019s release, but Mr. Stewart remained prolific, collaborating with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Tricky and Massive Attack, and releasing a string of eclectic solo albums over the years that, characteristically, were as subtle as a bazooka.",
      "The first, \u201cLearning to Cope With Cowardice,\u201d from 1983, was rereleased in 2006. It inspired the music site Pitchfork to note the single-minded intensity of this \u201cpossible madman and ",
      " that was marginalized in his own time, only to later be viewed as a seer.\u201d",
      "Little is publicly known about Mr. Stewart\u2019s personal life, and information about his survivors was not available.",
      "In 2010, he reunited with the Pop Group and released two more albums, \u201cCitizen Zombie\u201d (2015) and \u201cHoneymoon on Mars\u201d (2016). Both its albums and live performances showed that the band, and Mr. Stewart, had not lost a flicker of their fire.",

      "More than two decades ago, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery acquired a 19th-century album filled with nearly 2,000 silhouette portraits, including those of two former presidents.",
      "Before displaying the cut-paper portraits, made by a traveling artist named William Bache, the museum needed to create a new, sturdier binding for the book. That\u2019s when curators spotted an unusual red residue on the pages, and decided to test the book to make sure it was safe to handle. They found that each of the album\u2019s fragile pages was laced with arsenic.",
      "The album sat in a box until earlier this year, when curators used a grant from the Getty Foundation to digitize it. The museum ",
      "e last month, allowing anyone to virtually thumb through the images and learn more about Bache\u2019s life and work through an interactive timeline.",
      "Robyn Asleson, the museum\u2019s curator of prints and drawings, said that researchers had identified a little over 1,000 of the 1,800 portraits. By digitizing the album and making it available online, she said, she hoped it will eventually be possible to identify every portrait in the collection.",
      "\u201cWe realized that this book represented a lot of people that left no other portrait behind,\u201d Dr. Asleson said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s a really interesting way of looking at early 19th-century American history and just kind of a cross-section of society.\u201d",
      "At the time, the invention of photography was still several years off, and having a portrait painted was time consuming and expensive. Silhouettes were a cheaper, more accessible form of portraiture.",
      "The 1,800 portraits represent a wide range of people, including prominent figures like Thomas Jefferson and George and Martha Washington, as well as enslaved and formerly enslaved people, said Anne Verplanck, a retired associate professor of American studies at Penn State University, Harrisburg, and a researcher of portraits.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s rarely a complete or large list of who they portrayed,\u201d Dr. Verplanck said. \u201cThis gives us an unusual detail of life back then.\u201d",
      "Bache, who emigrated from England to Philadelphia in May 1793, was like a \u201ctraveling salesman, but for silhouettes,\u201d Dr. Asleson said.",
      "He traveled up and down the East Coast from Maine to Virginia, selling portraits for money. He eventually settled in New Orleans, where he created nearly 700 portraits of people of varying origins, including French, Spanish, German, British and Caribbean. Then he traveled to Cuba, where he went door to door offering his services. Despite having no formal training as an artist, Bache had a robust clientele, and kept his prices low, offering four profiles for 25 cents, or the equivalent of about $5 today.",
      "Dr. Asleson said Bache used a physiognotrace, a mechanical device that he modified and patented in 1803, that could trace the contours of a human face ",
      " without coming into contact with it. After he finished a portrait, Bache would add additional details, like locks of curly hair, to make it even more accurate.",
      "Bache assigned most customers a number. He\u2019d quickly draw their silhouette and, after handing them their copies, keep the leftover cutout and paste it into the album, creating a \u201cyearbook\u201d of his work, Dr. Asleson said. At the back of the book, he kept a ledger where he noted each number and the corresponding name.",
      "Dr. Asleson said Bache had started out neatly rendering each name, but his writing became sloppier over time. Many of the names were written phonetically, she said, which often resulted in misspellings.",
      "After receiving the grant from the Getty Foundation, the museum worked with a photographer from the Smithsonian, a paper conservator and a few other people to make high-resolution images of the portraits over a two-week period. Because of the arsenic, Dr. Asleson said that each person had to wear a face mask, gloves and a protective gown, and that a scientist was on hand to monitor the toxin levels to ensure it was safe.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the arsenic ended up on the book\u2019s pages, but ",
      " in the 19th century, and was often found in food, medicine and even common goods like face powder. An arsenic-based green pigment was used in wallpaper in Britain at the time.",
      "Heather MacDonald, a senior program officer with the Getty Foundation, said the project was a perfect fit for its ",
      ".",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s emblematic of what we are trying to do: support curators who want to take parts of museum collections that are tucked away and give them a visibility, and really create frameworks that let people understand their relevance,\u201d she said.",
      "Dr. Asleson and a research assistant, Elizabeth Isaacson, scanned Ancestry.com and pored over digitized newspapers, history books, baptismal records, wills and marriage certificates to identify people whose silhouettes appear in the book. They identified even more after Dr. Asleson expanded her research to include Spanish-language materials, and discovered that Bache had worked in Cuba.",
      "About half the people whose portraits are included in the book were identified after the gallery was released online. Dr. Asleson said she had heard from a historian in New Orleans who helped the curators identify a few of the silhouettes \u2014 exactly what the researchers had hoped would happen.",
      "Ideally, Dr. Asleson said, someone might still have a silhouette portrait passed down through the generations that could be matched to one of the images in the book. Another hope, she said, is that as more people trace their family\u2019s history through genetic genealogy, more of Bache\u2019s subjects may be identified.",
      "\u201cWe just realized that it will be of real interest to people who are descendants or who have relatives represented in this album, who have no other image of a great-great-grandfather, great-great-grandmother,\u201d Dr. Asleson said. \u201cI would think this would be really exciting and valuable for them to have.\u201d"

      "Harrison Ball, ",
      ", has tears in his toes. His sesamoid bone is crushed and, he said, dying. There is bone shard sticking into a tendon in his foot. His arthritis is so bad that his doctor told him it was comparable to that of an elderly person. He can\u2019t do his job if he can\u2019t pirouette.",
      "So on Sunday, he\u2019s leaving his job. He\u2019s barely 30.",
      "Such an early farewell is not the norm. But for Ball, who was promoted to the rank of principal dancer just last year, the injuries were too much. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I just can\u2019t do my job without being in an enormous amount of pain,\u201d he said.",
      "Even with that pain, Ball has been performing in new, intriguing ways. As the Poet in \u201cLa Sonnambula\u201d and Puck in \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d both George Balanchine ballets, his seriousness, his investment as a dramatic dancer brought a new urgency to the characters. \u201cI could just see his future right in front of me lining up,\u201d said Wendy Whelan, City Ballet\u2019s associate artistic director.",
      "Whelan is trying to look at the bigger picture in terms of Ball and others who have parted ways with the company since the pandemic started. There have been more than a few and from all ranks, including Jonathan Fahoury, Claire Kretzschmar and Lauren Lovette. \u201cEverybody knows leaving is scary,\u201d she said. \u201cArtists, young people are a little more courageous a little sooner.\u201d",
      "Whelan and Jonathan Stafford, the company\u2019s artistic director, had been excited to promote Ball. \u201cHe\u2019s such a technician and this classicist and also contemporary and free \u2014 he\u2019s an investigator, you know?\u201d Whelan said. \u201cYou always love when you have a dancer like that at your fingertips to guide and help. He could morph.\u201d",
      "Ball is looking more toward acting in his future. He just got a part on the ballet-world series \u201c\u00c9toile,\u201d coming to Amazon, by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and \u201cBunheads.\u201d He\u2019s also focused on choreography: His \u201cPurcell Suite,\u201d a work for New Jersey Ballet, will be performed at ",
      " in June. And his personal life has come together, too. He is engaged to the fashion designer ",
      " whom he met at City Ballet and became close with during the pandemic.",
      "Ball, disarming and funny, has a spontaneous streak. Much of his life has been erratic and wild, fueled, in part, by drug and alcohol addiction. (He was partial to cocaine, he said; he\u2019s been sober for more than five years.) Even Ball\u2019s childhood was unorthodox. He started ballet training at 4 with the now-defunct Charleston Ballet Theater in South Carolina and performed as a child. \u201cI was this little kid, and I was touring with all these adults,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the day, the dancers would take me with them during the lunch break. They would all go to a bar.\u201d",
      "When he was about 15, while a student at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, he lost his dorm privileges as a result of disciplinary action; with his family\u2019s support, he lived on his own in an apartment, he said, with his mother checking in on him periodically from South Carolina, where she and her husband were raising two other sons. Soon, he was fully on his own. \u201cIt was a really weird situation,\u201d Vera Ball, his mother, said, \u201cbut, yeah, that\u2019s what we had to do.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI just wanted him to be able to be him, and this was where it was.\u201d",
      "He was enrolled at the Professional Children\u2019s School, which specializes in educating young artists, athletes and others, but stopped going. As a ballet student and as a member of City Ballet, which he joined in 2012, he was something of a party animal. He had a steady paycheck but was always short on cash.",
      "When he was 24, he broke both of his feet in a rehearsal. He wasn\u2019t even dancing when it happened. \u201cI was talking, and I took a step on my right foot, and it went\u201d \u2014 Ball clicked his tongue to make a popping sound \u2014 \u201cand then I took a step on my left foot\u201d \u2014 he clicked again \u2014 \u201cand I just fell.\u201d Instead of crying, he laughed. Surely, this was a sign. \u201cI had a really rampant alcohol problem at that time,\u201d he said. \u201cI was using a lot of drugs. I was homeless for a while. I was living in a car.\u201d",
      "He slept and showered at the theater, he said. The address on his driver\u2019s license still reads 20 Lincoln Center Plaza. \u201cIt was a really wild moment for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the hardest part of it was keeping up the facade, right? Because nobody really knew.\u201d",
      "The only person at the company he had told about his addiction was Peter Martins, then the artistic leader. \u201cI was just so afraid,\u201d Ball said. \u201cI told him, and he offered financial support and just said, \u2018Go heal.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it. He said to me that the ballet will save me. And in a way he was right because it was always something that tethered me. It held me accountable.",
      "\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the ballet to show up to every day,\u201d he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have lived.\u201d",
      "Ball, who went to a rehab facility in Thailand \u2014 \u201cit was cheaper than rehab in America\u201d \u2014 said he was eager to talk about this part of his life because he knows that many struggle with addiction. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the dance world,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, let\u2019s be real.\u201d",
      "When Martins stepped down after accusations of physical and mental abuse, Ball went into panic mode. Martins, who was later cleared by an independent investigation, was the only person who knew why Ball was in Thailand. The assumption was that he was healing from an injury. \u201cThis guy came up to me and said, \u2018Oh, I just saw that your boss was #MeToo\u2019d,\u2019\u201d Ball said. \u201cI was like, ",
      "? I didn\u2019t even know that #MeToo had happened. In rehab, you\u2019re literally cut off.\u201d",
      "Ball told the company about his situation and was put on disability. \u201cThey said, \u2018Just take your time,\u2019\u201d he recalled. He was out for a year and a half.",
      "In recent seasons, he has taken on repertory that is more subtle, less virtuosic \u2014 a calculated decision, he said, so that he could be onstage but not hurt himself. And he realized something. \u201cI see everything that they were telling me,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTo be myself, to dance the way I wanted to dance and just to kind of throw it all away.\u201d",
      "It took him years, he said, to be himself onstage. His farewell program offers a final chance, in a debut, ",
      " in which two dancers find themselves alone in a ballet studio with the audience, essentially, as their mirror. \u201cThat ballet feels so intimate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s the definition of what it is to be a dancer.\u201d",
      "\u201cFaun\u201d begins and ends with Ball alone, stretched out on the floor. Earlier this week, Ball and Unity Phelan rehearsed it with the repertory director Jean-Pierre Frohlich. After a run-through, Phelan walked over to Ball. \u201cThis is going to be very emotional,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019m walking away from you.\u201d",
      "Ball said, \u201cAre you crying?\u201d",
      "Frohlich had notes. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was intimacy, which is what we want. The most important thing is do not perform. It does it. ",
      " it.\u201d",
      "After Sunday\u2019s performance, Ball will have to trust himself, his future. He is working on a memoir. \u201cI lived a lot of lives in the past 12, 13 years that I\u2019ve been in this company,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I got the great privilege of dancing on some of the best stages in the world, dancing the best ballets in the world, dancing for the best dancers in the world, with the best dancers in the world. And I got to put this theater on my driver\u2019s license. Isn\u2019t that funny?\u201d",
      "He paused and added, \u201cI have to change it now, though.\u201d"

      "In 2008, Swann Auction Galleries in Manhattan sold three Greek-language manuscripts from the 16th and 17th centuries to an antiquities dealer who returned them two years later after concluding they might have been looted.",
      "The dealer was reimbursed but the auction house, its officials said, was unable to reach the person who had consigned the items. So they sat on a shelf for more than a decade, all but lost in the shuffle of daily operations.",
      "Three months ago, though, the manuscripts resurfaced when Swann\u2019s chief financial officer went through his office before a renovation. There on a shelf in a long-forgotten plastic bag were the manuscripts, which are believed to have been stolen from a Greek monastery in the midst of World War I.",
      "They are thought to have been lost in 1917 when Bulgarian combatants are said to have plundered nearly 900 items from the Theotokos Eikosiphoinissa Patriarchal and Stavropegial Monastery, often called Kosinitza, in northern Greece.",
      "The manuscripts will be sent back to the monastery, and their return is to be commemorated on Friday in a repatriation ceremony in Lower Manhattan. After the ceremony, arranged by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, Archbishop Elpidophoros of America is planning to travel to Constantinople to deliver the manuscripts to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church. From there, the items will go back to Kosinitza.",
      "\u201cIt is a blessing for the monastic sisterhood at the monastery of Theotokos Eikosiphoinissa to see the contents of their former library slowly being returned to them,\u201d Archbishop Elpidophoros said in a statement. He said the church hopes that other organizations with manuscripts stolen from the monastery would also return them.",
      "The sweeping scale of systematic looting during World War II by Nazi forces tends to overshadow the fact that artworks were routinely plundered during other conflicts. Roman generals, Alexander the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte were known to have looted artworks during military campaigns, said Leila Amineddoleh, a lawyer who specializes in art and cultural heritage law and who has been serving as a consultant for lawyers seeking the return of documents they say were taken from the monastery.",
      "But while some looting efforts are carried out in an organized fashion on behalf of an empire and its aspirations, Amineddoleh said the turmoil of war also provides cover for thefts by fighters who act on their own, not on orders.",
      "\u201cSometimes looting is done nation to nation,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s done by individuals as a crime of opportunity.\u201d",
      "The plundering of Kosinitza would appear to fall into the second category. The monastery was founded in about the fifth century, and by the 18th century was said to have a collection of some 1,300 volumes, an Eastern Orthodox Church official wrote in a letter in 2015. The official added that the monastery was attacked in 1917 by \u201cmarauding Bulgarian guerilla forces\u201d who sacked its library.",
      "Four days after the attack, a letter from a local official to the Greek Foreign Affairs Delegation of Sofia said that about 60 bandits had entered the monastery, assaulted men there and used 24 mules to cart off their spoils.",
      "After being rediscovered recently at Swann, the yellowed manuscripts made their way to the desk of Devon Eastland, a senior specialist in early printed books at the auction house.",

      "They are among the 700 jewels from the estate of an Austrian heiress that will go on sale at Christie\u2019s on May 3 as part of one of the ",
      ". The auction house is predicting that jewels from the estate of Heidi Horten, the heiress who died last year, will bring in more than $150 million, surpassing the ",
      " taken in during the 2011 sale of Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s collection.",
      "The proceeds are to benefit a charitable foundation established by Horten, whose husband, Helmut, was a German retailing billionaire whose specialty was department stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most beautifully curated collections that will ever come up in the jewelry world,\u201d said Anthea Peers, president of Christie\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa. \u201cThis is a sale that will do an enormous amount for philanthropy. That\u2019s important for the estate and for us.\u201d",
      "But the auction house has acknowledged that, in deciding to host the sale, it also had to grapple with the fact that Helmut Horten\u2019s business empire was built atop his purchase of companies from Jews who were pressed to sell by the Nazis.",
      "\u201cWe are aware there is a painful history,\u201d Peers said. \u201cWe weighed that up against various factors,\u201d she added, saying that the foundation is \u201ca key driver of philanthropic causes.\u201d",
      "The Heidi Horten Foundation finances medical research and runs a museum in the heart of Vienna that features the expansive art collection she built. Several historians and the daughter of a businessman who worked for a Jewish-owned company targeted for acquisition by Helmut Horten during the Nazi era said the philanthropic benefits today are not sufficient to warrant a sales event that has the effect of obscuring the roots of the family\u2019s fortune.",
      "\u201cHe laid the foundations of his wealth during the Third Reich by acquiring companies on the cheap at fire-sale prices from Jewish business owners under duress,\u201d said David de Jong, the author of a ",
      " on Nazi billionaires. De Jong said that in several instances, such as the 1936 purchase of the Alsberg department store in Duisburg, Germany, Horten had paid no more than 65 percent of the company\u2019s value.",
      "Horten was 27 at the time of the Alsberg sale and advertised his purchase in a Nazi party newspaper, saying the store had \u201cpassed into Aryan ownership.\u201d",
      "The Aryanization of Jewish businesses in Germany took place in two stages. Before 1938, pressure from the Third Reich led Jews to sell their businesses, at times at deep discounts. After 1938, the sales were typically forced, and the prices paid often sank even lower. Horten was active during both phases, according to historians, who said he was involved in deals that spanned the Nazi takeover of Europe from Amsterdam to East Prussia.",
      "Last year, a historian hired by Heidi Horten to investigate the nature of her husband\u2019s fortune released a lengthy report that said Helmut Horten had clearly benefited from the acquisition of Jewish businesses sold under duress, but that the level of wealth he realized from those activities had been exaggerated.",
      "The historian, Peter Hoeres, said in his report that while Horten had exploited his opportunities, he had initially paid \u201cquite normal market prices\u201d for the Jewish companies, had been \u201ccomparatively fair\u201d in relation to the deals struck by other German businessmen and had to navigate his own complex relationship with the Nazis.",
      "The study concluded that Horten\u2019s actions were governed by an opportunistic business sense rather than Nazi ideology, and it cited several instances in which Horten kept on some Jews as either employees or suppliers, in contrast to the government\u2019s efforts. It also noted that, although Horten was a Nazi party member, he was later expelled.",
      "Critics of the report have said it downplayed the extent to which Horten benefited from Aryanization.",
      "\u201cAs a historian, I could not agree with the main narratives in the Hoeres report,\u201d said Birgit Kirchmayr, a member and senior adviser of the Austrian Art Restitution Advisory Board, explaining that it was not enough to just say that Horten \u201cwas not worse than others.\u201d",
      "Hoeres has defended his study as balanced, though in an interview he said he regretted using the phrase \u201ccomparatively fair,\u201d which he said had led some to mistakenly conclude he was minimizing the impact Horten had on Jewish business owners. He noted that his report had surfaced information that Horten used forced labor at a Berlin company he purchased in 1943 that repaired airplanes. \u201cWe have done research in 27 archives in Europe and have read thousands of articles and talked to a lot of contemporary witnesses,\u201d he said in an email, calling the results a \u201cgood job.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have tried to get the facts and we have not tried to whitewash it,\u201d Hoeres said. \u201cWhat you have is a mixed picture of Horten.\u201d",
      "Among those who have taken issue with the report is Stephanie Stephan, a journalist in Munich, who released a book last year detailing Horten\u2019s acquisition of Jewish businesses. She said the subject had been quite personal to her because her father, Reinhold Stephan, had been on the board of one of the companies, Gerzon, a fashion house with headquarters in Amsterdam. She said the Jewish owners were forced to sell to Horten, and she published an affidavit from one of them, Arthur Marx, who said Horten had threatened them with being deported to concentration camps if they resisted his takeover.",
      "\u201cMy father rebelled against Horten from the very beginning because he knew that he had already forced several Jewish owners of department stores in Germany to sell their department stores for ridiculous sums,\u201d Stephan said. \u201cHe immediately dismissed my father. Horten made sure that my father was imprisoned several times and finally was expelled from the Netherlands.\u201d",
      "Hoeres said in an interview that in an upcoming book he will cite research that demonstrates Horten never finalized the purchase of Gerzon, and he disputed the accuracy of Marx\u2019s affidavit, saying it was not supported by records from that era.",
      "Heidi Horten was 19 when she met her future husband, who was more than three decades older. They married in 1966, and when Helmut Horten died in 1987, she inherited nearly a billion dollars.",
      "Her husband\u2019s conduct during the war surfaced as a topic of discussion in recent years as she worked to open a museum for her art collection in Vienna that is operated by the Heidi Horten Foundation. The foundation did not respond to questions.",
      "The historian\u2019s review was commissioned then to address the questions that were raised.",
      "Now those questions have surfaced again as Christie\u2019s prepares for the sale. Kirchmayr, the member of the Austrian restitution panel, noted that the auction coincides with the 25th anniversary of the ",
      ", a treaty now used around the world to \u201cexpeditiously\u201d promote ",
      " to restitution claims. (Christie\u2019s ",
      " in Paris marking the occasion earlier this year.)",
      "Kirchmayr said she would have liked to have seen more transparency in the marketing materials Christie\u2019s put forward to promote the Horten sale. None of it initially mentioned Helmut Horten\u2019s dealings with Jewish business owners.",
      "\u201cYou can say that the jewelry itself is not looted,\u201d Kirchmayr acknowledged. \u201cBut the money is connected with the Nazi past, and this is a fact that has to be mentioned in the biographies of the collectors.\u201d",
      "After some criticism of the sale surfaced, Christie\u2019s added a mention of Horten\u2019s purchase of Jewish businesses that were \u201csold under duress\u201d and said it would donate a portion of the proceeds from the sale to Holocaust research and education.",
      "\u201cIt was never Christie\u2019s intention to hide information about the well-documented history of Mr. Horten,\u201d Guillaume Cerutti, the chief executive at Christie\u2019s, said in a statement.",

      "Miami residents who were \u201cmade in Dade\u201d carry their heritage on their sleeves, and it informs their writing beautifully. But some of the best stories set in Miami begin elsewhere: in Puerto Rico and Cuba, the Deep South and New England. I expect this will continue to be the case.

There\u2019s much trauma in these pages, but also much triumph, including in the fact that this book came to exist.

Not surprisingly, the Gulf has shaped Kerala\u2019s culture and literature. The territory sits between the Indian Ocean and the Western Ghats, the mountain range that runs parallel to the coast. Forty-four rivers run to the sea, spawning vast lakes, countless streams, lagoons, bottle-green lotus ponds and a latticework of backwaters that are Kerala\u2019s giant circulatory system, with the annual monsoon its beating heart.",

      "Kerala\u2019s uniqueness developed in part because the towering Western Ghats sheltered the state from invaders from the north, while the mountains\u2019 fertile slopes allowed spices such as pepper and cardamom to grow wild. For centuries, Arab sailors caught the southwesterlies in the lateen sails of their dhows to come to the \u201cSpice Coast.\u201d When the winds reversed, they carried their purchases of pepper, clove, cardamom, ginger and cinnamon back to Venice or Genoa, where they sold them for small fortunes.

Dederer is continually ",
      " \u2014 not in the adjectival sense, but as the present participle: showing us her thought process, correcting as she goes and experimenting with different forms.",

      "Dederer, the \u201cfemale writer\u201d \u2014 and a nimble, witty one \u2014 has come to believe that the nonchalance with which Allen\u2019s character dates a high schooler ruins the film, which has always faintly disturbed her, especially since the director left Mia Farrow for her daughter Soon-Yi Previn. The male writer takes the New Critical position that she should judge \u201cManhattan\u201d just on aesthetics, and that it\u2019s a masterpiece.",
      "Woody Allen has already taken up too much space in this review. The so-called monster \u2014 a term that, handily, can denote success and size as well as deviance \u2014 has a way of doing that.",

      ", of course, whose Harry Potter series had enraptured Dederer\u2019s family before she spoke about transgender issues; but also Virginia Woolf, whose diaries were \u201cpocked\u201d with \u201cflippant antisemitic remarks\u201d though she was married to a Jew; Willa Cather, who dehumanized Black people in \u201cMy \u00c1ntonia\u201d; Laura Ingalls Wilder, who dehumanized Native Americans in the \u201cLittle House\u201d series; and Doris Lessing, who left two children behind when she moved from Rhodesia to London with the third.",
      "\u201cThis is what female monstrousness looks like: abandoning the kids. Always,\u201d declares Dederer, a mother of two still feeling guilty about a decade of drinking and a five-week retreat to Marfa, Texas. Here I\u2019d argue with her (and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind; she is continually arguing with herself). Unless not having children, like Woolf, constitutes a kind of abandonment?",
      "\u201cMonster\u201d turns out to be but one of several words the author carefully palpates, finding it \u201cmale, testicular, old world.

      "\u201cStain\u201d is another piece of vocabulary Dederer finds useful, though Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Human Stain\u201d is not among the many works analyzed here, and Roth is mentioned only in passing, despite the very interesting case of sexual misconduct accusations against his biographer that has jeopardized ",
      ".",
      "Maybe that\u2019s because \u201cbiography,\u201d to Dederer, seems not so much noble genre as ubiquitous nuisance, a \u201cdisrupter of my own pleasure\u201d: just a set of personal details you can search for on that most monstrous of modern entities, the internet. \u201cWe swim in biography; we are sick with biography,\u201d she writes. It \u201cused to be something you sought out, yearned for, actively pursued. Now it falls on your head all day long.\u201d",
      "Corollary to the \u201cmonster,\u201d more passive, is the \u201cstain\u201d: some ugliness coloring someone\u2019s life that you don\u2019t want to know, that nonetheless spreads and can ruin perception of his or her work. Stains seep through time, to the people who hurt the artist and the people the artist hurt, and in these days of heightened parasocial relationships, the people he or she hurts include us: the fan who knew too much.",
      "Every fan\u2019s shelf of scandal, the books",
      "snatched furtively off the stoop, looks different. Dederer\u2019s: light on Roth, laden with Vladimir Nabokov. Her exquisitely reasoned vindication of \u201cLolita\u201d brought tears of gratitude to my eyes.",

      " on TikTok.",
      "I don\u2019t think the word \u201cambition\u201d attached to a woman is pejorative anymore. I don\u2019t think women who complete their work \u2014 \u201cfinishers,\u201d Dederer calls them \u2014 are in any way monstrous or comparable to male predators. They\u2019re A students! Or just being professional.",

      ". Now Rosen gives us the exquisitely fine print, drawing from clips, court and police records, legal and medical studies, interviews, diaries and some of Laudor\u2019s own feverish compositions, as he examines the porous line between brilliance and insanity and the complicated policy questions posed by deinstitutionalization.",
      "\u201cI grew up surrounded by people who wrote things down,\u201d he notes with understatement, \u201cand wrote things down myself.\u201d",
      "The two men were raised Jewish and bookish in the suburb of New Rochelle, N.Y., advertised on train platforms as \u201cForty-five minutes from Broadway.\u201d It was an incubator to a surprising number of cultural big shots, including E.L. Doctorow, Norman Rockwell, Don McLean and Cynthia Ozick, the author\u2019s mother\u2019s best friend.",
      "\u201cThe same expectation shaping his life was shaping mine,\u201d Rosen writes of Laudor. \u201cThe belief that your brain is your rocket ship and that simply as a matter of course you are going to climb inside and blast off.\u201d",
      "They both aspired to be writers, but Jonathan was always a little in the shadow of Michael, who was only slightly taller but far more confident and popular: reading megafast, \u201c\u2018inhaling\u2019 a page the way he inhaled a pizza,\u201d unafraid of drugs, girls or swimming the entire length of a lake.",

More than one flew over the cuckoo\u2019s nest.",
      "Rosen envied the \u201cjilted, defiant aura\u201d of children affected by divorce and watched as a friend\u2019s father, a psychiatrist who played bass in a band called the Nocturnal Emissions, temporarily abandoned his family to seek spiritual awakening in India.",

Laudor started a job at Bain & Company, the high-pressure management consultancy, to stockpile a cash cushion before beginning his writing career. There, the intensity and imagination he\u2019d always displayed boiled over into paranoia and delusions. A secretary seemed to grow claws and flash bloody teeth; he worried that the phones were tapped and grew convinced his parents had been murdered and replaced by surgically altered Nazis.",
      "\u201cThe break,\u201d as Rosen writes, \u201cwas not orthopedic.\u201d ",
      "Laudor still aced his LSATs. After hospitalization, his pride hurt by a doctor\u2019s suggestion that he try cashiering at Macy\u2019s, he enrolled at Yale\u2019s law school and, in The Times, revealed himself as a \u201cflaming schizophrenic,\u201d quickly lauded as an advocate of mental-health accommodations.",

      "Laudor\u2019s 80-page book proposal (which Rosen mines, along with another writer\u2019s unfilmed screenplay) was for the power agent Tina Bennett and contained elements of bildungsroman, philosophical treatise, science fiction and spy thriller. But his life, and that of Costello, a gentle supporter and computer whiz who worked in education, would soon tip into bloody horror. Found unfit to stand trial, he was sent to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital.",
      "Rosen cannot release Laudor, but he has rehabilitated and rehumanized him on the page while honoring his victim. \u201cThe Best Minds\u201d is too a thoughtfully built, deeply sourced indictment of a society that prioritizes profit, quick fixes and happy endings over the long slog of care. \u201cIt turned out that going to the moon was easier than curing, preventing or even providing adequate treatment for illnesses that doctors, not so long before, had referred to as lunacy,\u201d he writes, in rueful continuation of the rocket-ship metaphor.",
      "Effectively taking over his friend\u2019s unfinished project, braiding it with his own story of clinical anxiety as well as skeins of history, medicine, religion and true crime, the author has transcended childhood rivalry by twinning their stories, an act of tremendous compassion and a literary triumph.",
      "\u201cEvery review felt like a public colonoscopy,\u201d Rosen writes of his first novel\u2019s reception. In this brave and nuanced book, I could not find so much as a polyp.",

      "Old family stories are hard to revivify, even when they\u2019re good family stories. Nothing fades faster, and is more elusive, than the motivations of people who lived a long time ago, unless they were famous enough to leave a churning wake behind them or wrote honest, plucky memoirs of their own.",
      "This is the problem Ava Chin is up against in her sensitive, ambitious, well-reported, heavily peopled yet curiously remote memoir-cum-history, \u201cMott Street: A Chinese American Family\u2019s Story of Exclusion and Homecoming.\u201d It\u2019s a book that has everything going for it except that intangible spark that crisp and confident storytelling throws off. The air is a bit still in this book, as if one is walking behind the docent on a long museum tour.",
      "Chin\u2019s memoir takes its title from the narrow north-south road in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown that\u2019s generally thought of as its Main Street, to which Chin\u2019s family has a long and intricate and prosperous connection. Members of both sides were born, established businesses, ate, drank and died there. Many lived in the same building.",
      "When she\u2019s on Mott Street, Chin feels she\u2019s at home \u2014 except when she feels like an out-and-out alien (she can\u2019t decide) because she and her mother were abandoned by her father and driven from the home place.",
      "Chin grew up in Flushing, Queens, before its Chinese-immigrant population surpassed that of Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. She was a latchkey kid, raised in part by her grandparents. She was among the few Asians in her schools.",
      "She began to sense that there was a side of her family that no one talked about. \u201cMott Street\u201d opens with her meeting her long-distant father, a wealthy lawyer and handsome former politician named Stanley Chin. About him, Chin\u2019s grandmother had told her, \u201cHe used your mother, then threw her away.\u201d",
      "Father and daughter never establish much of a connection, but the author begins to pull other threads of her family\u2019s past and present. A lot of material comes loose.",
      "\u201cMott Street\u201d is a big book that scrutinizes four generations of her family\u2019s life. It has a great deal to say about the Chinese experience in this country: the perilous journeys here, the racism that forced many into menial railroad and laundry jobs, and the draconian Chinese exclusion laws that for six decades (1882-1943) halted most legal immigration and blocked Chinese people from citizenship.",
      "The story has a certain pageantry. It flexes to absorb world wars, cholera epidemics,",
      "the San Francisco earthquake (the loss of official documents in flattened buildings was a boon to many Chinese immigrants), sensational crimes, foot binding and the rise of urban tongs, warring social groups that some would compare to the mafia.",
      "There is a roll call of American politicians who hurt, and helped, the Chinese American cause. There is a great deal of writing about the consolations of food \u2014 the author\u2019s previous book was \u201cEating Wildly: Foraging for Life, Love and the Perfect Meal\u201d (2014) \u2014 and an analysis of how American Jews became so fond of Chinese cuisines. ",
      "There are so many relatives in these pages that readers will find themselves frequently referring to the family tree in front. A few primary faces emerge.",
      "One is Chin On, the author\u2019s paternal great-grandfather, who arrived here in the 1890s. He had swagger, the \u201ckind of arrogance and flair that would later become known as a distinctively Chin quality,\u201d Chin writes.",
      "He was a violent, amoral, heavy-drinking man, a gambling high-roller who owned or co-owned nightclubs and pool halls and opium dens and brothels. Woe to those who borrowed money from him and could not pay it back. One of Chin On\u2019s heavies carried a hatchet and, in Sweeney Todd fashion, was \u201cnever hesitant to turn an enemy of the family into human pork.\u201d The toxic male may be on the run in America, but as dramatis personae he remains a close-to-indispensable spice.",
      "Excellent to read about, too, is Wu Doshim, a maternal relative. Around the turn of the last century he edited The Chinese Reform Weekly News, one of the first Chinese-language newspapers in New York. He had to work linguistic miracles because he had only about 7,000 pieces of metal type in Chinese, while most metropolitan Chinese papers used more than 30,000. He must have felt the way Georges Perec did when he wrote a novel without using the letter \u201ce.\u201d",
      "The women tended to leave less plentiful paper trails, but Chin painstakingly brings several to life. One is Wu Doshim\u2019s wife, Cheung To Chun, who was a member of the darker-skinned and persecuted Hakka ethnic group. Chun experienced racism at the hands of other Chinese Americans,",
      "and lived most her life here undocumented.",
      "Another is Elva Lisk, the white daughter of a Civil War veteran who married into Chin\u2019s maternal family. Elva had both male and female sex organs, Chin writes. Here and throughout the book, Chin places imagined dialogue, in italics, into her text. (There are imagined sex scenes as well.) This dialogue verges on the mawkish: \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "This memoir evokes emotion but, as with the made-up dialogue, Chin sometimes doesn\u2019t trust her readers to absorb it on their own. She dots painful historical scenes with commentary \u2014 \u201cdrives me bonkers,\u201d \u201cI want to throttle the immigration officers,\u201d \u201cI am grieving\u201d \u2014 after these moments have already spoken plainly.",
      "\u201cMott Street\u201d takes us to the present moment. She recalls the American president who referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cKung Flu\u201d and \u201cChina virus.\u201d She charts the uptick in anti-Asian violence in the United States, and she writes about her life in New York City, and her new fear of subways:",
      "These days, I only travel aboveground.",
      "I carry a flashlight with me at all times, and I wear only shoes and clothing that I can run in, or drop-kick someone in, if attacked.",
      "I practice my squats and my daily push-ups on the ferry to my studio to strengthen my arms and my core, and I advise other Asians to do the same. (I even started a self-defense group, Sisters in Self-Defense, with artist Alison Kuo in order to help community members learn how to protect themselves.)",

      "In \u201cThe Ugly History of Beautiful Things,\u201d Katy Kelleher writes about the extreme and sometimes hideous lengths that people have gone to in order to obtain coveted objects of beauty: ruining their health, wrecking the planet, inflicting suffering on others. As someone with a history of depression that has entailed self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she says that beauty has helped provide the purpose to keep her going: \u201cThe hope for beauty makes me leave my bed each morning rather than moldering in the sheets until I develop bedsores.\u201d",
      "Yet the beauty she seeks is also tied up with feelings of guilt. \u201cI\u2019ve never found an object that was untouched by the depravity of human greed or unblemished by the chemical undoings of time,\u201d Kelleher writes. She buys trinkets and generates garbage. A journalist who writes about home and design, she realizes that it has been her job to encourage others to do the same.",
      "Thankfully, this book isn\u2019t her penance \u2014 it\u2019s more surprising and ambivalent than that, and there isn\u2019t any scolding here, even if some of what she recounts is disturbing and truly horrific. Kelleher points out that an element of ugliness can be part of an object\u2019s appeal, distinguishing between the intriguingly beautiful and the boringly pretty. There is, of course, the Japanese notion of wabi-sabi, which holds that imperfection can be a reminder of life\u2019s impermanence and contingency; a decaying flower might convey another layer of experience that a fresh bloom won\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t explicitly mention Japanese aesthetics, but a chapter on the Nazi fetish for gleaming white porcelain had me rereading Tanizaki\u2019s \u201cIn Praise of Shadows,\u201d in which he writes about wanting a toilet made of black lacquered wood.",
      "But an ugly history is different. Knowledge of it can detract from an object\u2019s allure even as it signals the object\u2019s desirability \u2014 making it glaringly clear how rare something is, and therefore how scarcity has helped to determine its value. In the 19th century, an orchid hunter might have been eaten by a tiger or disappeared forever somewhere in the jungle thicket. During the Renaissance, Venetian glassmakers often worked with toxic materials like lead and mercury; those who didn\u2019t go mad from the vapors or die from mysterious stomach ailments would still have to worry about being assassinated by glassmaking rivals or, should they try to emigrate, by their autocratic rulers.",
      "The mirrors that these glassmakers so painstakingly created have since achieved the status of mass-produced goods, part of a system that has eliminated some hazards while generating others. Mirrors used to be rare and prized enough to be associated with scrying and magic; now, Kelleher laments, they\u2019re so common that they\u2019re taken for granted, or else derided as mere objects of vanity instead of marvelous contraptions that allowed for the \u201csense of awe\u201d that comes with seeing oneself.",
      "Kelleher organizes her book by object, with chapters on gemstones (shadowed by violence), on makeup (shadowed by toxicity), on perfume (shadowed by animal excretions), among others. She has a knack for nimbly threading together her own memories and tastes with the histories of the objects themselves. She doesn\u2019t want cruelty in her goods, and so she fills vases with foraged greenery and buys a silk dress secondhand. \u201cI wanted to feel a fabric that skims over my skin like breeze,\u201d she explains. \u201cHave you ever slipped a silk robe around your body and felt it brush against your nipples?\u201d",
      "Most people in the world would undoubtedly answer no; silk is still a luxury good, even if it\u2019s been made more accessible by exploitative labor practices. Kelleher wrestles with some of these knotty issues, though her enthusiasm is most palpable when she is writing about the goods themselves. We yearn for beautiful things that give us sensual pleasure \u2014 that seems obvious enough. But a luxury good \u201cwas never intended to be available to everyone,\u201d she writes \u2014 that also seems obvious. So what are the implications of this? Not everyone who wants to feel the caress of a silk robe can afford it, especially if it\u2019s ethically made. Should you rein in your desires? Or does that amount to letting the elite off the hook: They do what they wish, while the rest of us make do with what we can get?",
      "It\u2019s a lot of pressure to put on a flimsy robe, but as Kelleher knows, you can\u2019t write about this stuff without at least gesturing at the bigger stuff: existence and mortality, capitalism and consumption. By the end of the book, she comes to a d\u00e9tente with her own yearning. She recognizes that she can appreciate beauty without possessing it \u2014 she can take her daughter to the beach and make mandalas out of shell fragments; she can go for a walk and spot a monarch butterfly in a field or a pink orchid in a bog. But she admits that she still longs for a fantasy home with marble countertops and slate tiles, even if her conscience and her bank account make it an impossibility.",
      "\u201cEach beauty I find will fade, degrade, break and tarnish,\u201d Kelleher writes, \u201cand there\u2019s no point in asking for what I can\u2019t have.\u201d",

      "The French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir provides an epigraph for \u201cBirth,\u201d Rebecca Grant\u2019s exploration of pregnancy and childbirth in the United States. \u201cPregnancy is above all a drama playing itself out inside the woman between her and herself,\u201d Beauvoir wrote in \u201cThe Second Sex\u201d (1949). \u201cShe experiences it both as an enrichment and a mutilation.\u201d",
      "The words are jarring, in both their violence and their certitude. But coming as they do from a person who never actually was pregnant, they embody perfectly one of the major themes of this often compelling new book, which repeatedly drives home the degree to which childbearing has inspired philosophizing, moralizing, catastrophizing and politicizing \u2014 more often than not, from high-minded and influential parties with no firsthand knowledge of the experience.",
      "There were, for example, the male doctors who displaced female midwives as bedside facilitators of birth, denigrating the women\u2019s expertise and burnishing their own mystique \u2014 not to mention their fees \u2014 through sometimes questionable actions. There were the",
      "lawyers, insurers and hospital executives who helped turn",
      "the practice of delivering babies into emergency medicine. And, of course, there are the politicians and sometimes all-male panels of judges who continue to define the limits of women\u2019s reproductive possibilities today.",
      "T\u2019Nika, Alison and Jillian, the three mothers-to-be whose pregnancies give form to Grant\u2019s book, want nothing to do with the culture, beliefs and practices that stem from that history. Above all, they reject the idea that doctors know best, and that the safest, surest place to give birth is in a hospital. That\u2019s why they\u2019re all clients \u2014 and in Jillian\u2019s case, an employee as well \u2014 of the Andaluz Waterbirth Center in southwest Portland, Ore.",
      "Andaluz is a stand-alone clinic where parents with low-risk pregnancies are followed exclusively by midwives and can experience birth in a homey environment: on a queen-size bed, in a warm tub or on a birth stool, with friends, family, music and snacks nearby. It\u2019s a place where T\u2019Nika, an aspiring labor and delivery nurse, can have a water birth, receive nitrous oxide (laughing gas) for pain and be \u201cseen and heard\u201d \u2014 in sharp contrast with the belittling treatment she has received as a young Black woman facing a white, male medical establishment in the past. It\u2019s a place where Jillian, a former doula who watched powerlessly as doctors steamrolled frightened laboring patients into a \u201ccascade of interventions\u201d they neither wanted nor, in her judgment, needed, can find support for a home birth. And where Alison, a teacher and \u201coverachiever\u201d who doesn\u2019t like to feel out of control, can design a \u201cnatural\u201d birth experience consistent with her composting, chicken-owning, vegetarian values.",
      "The three women are willing to forgo the hospital-based comforts \u2014 or, critics might say, safeguards \u2014 that Andaluz doesn\u2019t provide:",
      "epidurals and narcotic painkillers, blood transfusions and inductions, doctors who can surgically intervene, should serious complications arise during birth. That\u2019s no light decision, and the horrendous levels of pain all three experience during their long days and nights of labor and childbirth will demonstrate the high cost of that choice. Yet they make it for weighty and worthy reasons.",
      "Mainstream birth in America, for all its seemingly reassuring medical advancements, technological enhancements and exceptional levels of expense, is a shamefully risky business. Our maternal mortality rate is more than three times that of most other high-income nations. At nearly one in three births, our rate of cesarean section deliveries is considerably above the 10 to 20 percent level that public health experts consider an acceptable benchmark. Bad as those numbers are, they\u2019re considerably worse for Black women, who are nearly three times more likely than white women to die or suffer serious complications from pregnancy and childbirth and have a higher C-section rate.",
      "And then there are the many and varied permutations of personal insult in our profit-driven, racialized and unequal medical settings.",
      "Jillian and Alison have each had a miscarriage, and both suffered the added injuries of cold treatment by the hospital staff. (Alison, who required a D&C procedure, informed both her obstetrician and her anesthesiologist that she didn\u2019t want general anesthesia \u2014 only to be told that, since she seemed \u201ckind of high maintenance,\u201d she\u2019d probably need even more of it. She only realized she\u2019d been put under when she woke up.) And for T\u2019Nika, personal and collective history combine to make the powerlessness that a partially paralyzing epidural would bring a terrifying prospect. A key reason she wants to give birth at Andaluz is that, for once, \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to have her guard up.\u201d",
      "\u201cBirth\u201d",
      "is an important book. Yet it\u2019s a frustrating one as well. Grant is a good storyteller, subtle and compassionate, but she can be inaccurate with numbers, language and the odd historical detail.",
      "The social context she deftly weaves into her protagonists\u2019 stories lends her work national scope. And yet her choice to focus on three women giving birth outside of hospitals \u2014 where 98 percent of deliveries currently take place \u2014 gravely undercuts the book\u2019s ability to tell its promised story of \u201cpregnancy in America.\u201d",
      "Ironically, Grant\u2019s narrow scope does Andaluz, which she clearly admires, a disservice: Since both T\u2019Nika and Alison end up in hospitals, where they opt for pain medication, the birthing center ends up losing two-thirds of the book\u2019s sample to doctors, nurses and the midwives who work alongside them in a mainstream setting. That\u2019s a rate that\u2019s way",
      "out of line with the best numbers available for free-standing birth centers in the United States. (While high-quality statistics on transfer rates to hospitals are few, the most frequently cited and largest study to date puts it at ",
      " percent.)",
      "And Grant would have done better by her subjects if, at the end of the book, she\u2019d done more to contextualize the difficulties they face in their first weeks of postpartum life. The exhaustion, isolation, pain and anxiety \u2014 not to mention the logistical difficulties of running back and forth to medical appointments with new babies \u2014 are all heightened by the do-it-yourself exceptionalism of early motherhood in the United States. In other wealthy nations, longer hospital (and birth clinic) stays, and at-home midwife, nursing and lactation consultant visits are standard parts of postnatal care \u2014 regardless of new parents\u2019 ability to pay. In Grant\u2019s account, going it alone after childbirth seems inevitable. But it doesn\u2019t have to be.",

      "Eleanor Catton\u2019s new novel, \u201c",
      ",\u201d is a rollicking eco-thriller that juggles a lot of heady themes with a big plot and a heedless sense of play \u2014 no surprise, really, from a writer who won Britain\u2019s prestigious Man Booker Prize for her previous novel, \u201cThe Luminaries,\u201d and promptly established herself as a leading light in New Zealand\u2019s literary community.",
      "On this week\u2019s podcast, Catton tells the host Gilbert Cruz how that early success affected her writing life (not much) as well as her life outside of writing (her marriage made local headlines, for one thing). She also discusses her aims for the new book and grapples with the slippery nature of New Zealand\u2019s national identity.",
      "\u201cYou very often hear New Zealanders defining their country in the negative rather than in the positive,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you ask somebody about New Zealand culture, they\u2019ll begin by describing something overseas and then they\u2019ll just say, Oh, well, we\u2019re just not like that. \u2026 I think that that\u2019s solidified over time into this kind of very odd sense of supremacy, actually. It\u2019s born out of an inferiority complex, but like many inferiority complexes, it manifests as a superiority complex.\u201d",
      "A word of warning, for listeners who care about plot spoilers: Toward the end of their conversation, Catton and Cruz talk about the novel\u2019s climactic scene and some of the questions it raises. So if you\u2019re a reader who prefers to be taken by surprise, you may want to finish \u201cBirnam Wood\u201d before you finish this episode."

      ", by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah",
      "Should I be having this much fun? This is one queasy testament to Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s talent: You cannot applaud his debut novel, \u201cChain-Gang All-Stars,\u201d without getting blood on your hands. To enjoy the action is to share in the guilt of the bloodthirsty fans sitting ringside at the live-broadcast death matches between prison inmates. Adjei-Brenyah is so good at writing fight scenes that our moral disgust never definitively stamps out the primitive thrill of reading them.",
      "This is also why his book works. It is an act of protest, but it does not straightforwardly preach. Instead, it lures you in, as if to demonstrate how easy it might be to accept a world this sick. Even readers who acknowledge the brazen evil of the dystopian premise \u2014 these televised duels offer prisoners a path to freedom \u2014 might find themselves titillated by its depiction, which functions as both satire and straight-up sportswriting. The lulls between bouts give readers a beat to think about all the ways they\u2019ve been conditioned to enjoy such a story, by any number of America\u2019s perversions: its narcotic televised pastimes, its singular talent for mass incarceration, its steady innovation in violence technology, its racial caste system, its eternal appetite for retribution. But it\u2019s fun, I promise.",
      "And yet, as much as this book made me laugh at these parts of the world I recognized as being mocked, it also made me wish I recognized less of it. The United States of \u201cChain-Gang All-Stars\u201d is like ours, if sharpened to absurd points and flung a few decades into the future. Its most famous athlete is Loretta Thurwar, our protagonist, beloved for bashing her peers to death with a large hammer. In her anonymous prior life, she was convicted of killing a lover. After opting into the Criminal Action Penal Entertainment (CAPE) program, Thurwar left the confines of a private prison and entered a more glamorous kind of captivity. These prisoners, known as Links, belong to teams called Chains, which trudge all day long in Marches all over the country. Periodically they arrive at arenas to fight Links from rival Chains to the death. These battles are presented for the world as pay-per-view sports. The rest of their daily lives, full of internal politics and wanton bloodshed, are packaged as episodic reality television.",
      "All this exposure leads to towering celebrity. The top fighters occupy a paradoxical place in society: the incarcerated influencer, as if Spartacus were churning out sponcon on his off days. Grocery stores and fast-food chains vie for precious ad space on Thurwar\u2019s skin and clothing. Drivers and soldier-police officers shepherd these celebrities to news conferences and civic engagement days; \u201cYour subjects are waiting, convict,\u201d one guard says to a popular fighter about to greet a rapt audience, compressing the irony into five words. Before fights, the star talent leads fans in call-and-response chants, working in an idiom that\u2019s equal parts Muhammad Ali, boom-bap rap and Zen koan. This \u201csport\u201d profits hugely from these athletes\u2019 charisma \u2014 which is, in most cases, unmistakably Black \u2014 while keeping them enslaved with electronic wrist restraints.",
      "This book is not shy with its allegories. After a triumph on the killing grounds, a fighter earns points with which to upgrade weapons or food or lodging, as if the prison commissary had drawn inspiration from a role-playing video game. What all these fighters seek is freedom, a word that appears capitalized throughout the book, like a term of art or faith. It comes in two types: Low Freedom (death, however it might find them) and High Freedom (pardon, commutation or clemency after three years survived on the circuit).",
      "This whole scheme is laid out in a voice that belongs only to Adjei-Brenyah, who bends the lurid into the lyrical \u2014 pretty words about hideous deeds. Some of his best fight sentences sound as if Joe Rogan had fallen into a trance and assumed the diction and rhythms of Toni Morrison. If you recoil at that unholy fusion, that\u2019s kind of the point; and the author keeps pulling off this shock, page after page. Adjei-Brenyah has a fine intuition, an almost spatial sense for what we need to see and what we don\u2019t. His names are crisp, like Sunset Harkless (a man) and Spinifer Black (a spear), and his compact euphemisms a gift. When the incarcerated fight to the death for public enjoyment, it is marketed to bros as \u201chard action-sports.\u201d One such audience member, catching a ray of pseudoenlightenment, realizes that watching a woman bash people to death for three years has turned him into \u201ca feminist.\u201d There\u2019s more than a little George Saunders in these high jinks, and it is no surprise to see him thanked as a mentor in the acknowledgments. The novel is a thorough display of authorial control; Adjei-Brenyah only ever loses his handle on the pace and tone in a few meandering dialogues between Thurwar and her team- and soul mate, Hurricane Staxxx.",
      "Some people in this imagined society protest the institution of CAPE, but many, many more happily fold it into their pop-cultural diet. Enthusiasts have figured out how to push headlong through the cognitive dissonance of enjoying live murder. That friction creates much of the novel\u2019s grim humor, which will be familiar to anyone whose favorite entertainment has an unavoidable human cost. One viewer slowly warms up to this sick spectacle as \u201ca study in humanity that she\u2019d decided any intellectual, socially aware person at least had to peruse. It was part of the cultural conversation; even if she was ambivalent about its ethics, she couldn\u2019t pretend it wasn\u2019t an interesting part of the world.\u201d Straight out of a thinking fan\u2019s defense of the N.F.L.",
      "Of course, in addition to the damage wrought by the entertainment industry on our public conscience, Adjei-Brenyah is concerned with the state\u2019s harm to those citizens it deems beyond saving. \u201cChain-Gang All-Stars\u201d is honest about the inhumanity of incarceration and the increasingly elaborate mechanisms we build in place of forgiveness and rehabilitation. As the plot careers forward, Adjei-Brenyah uses footnotes as tethers between fiction and reality, reminding us that his gladiatorial farce is just a little tragicomic leap from an extant American horror. At the bottom of the page, he might stash bits of the U.S. penal code or the Geneva Conventions: eulogies for real-life victims of police violence, solitary confinement and wrongful conviction. He presents potent arguments for abolition, from the fighters themselves and the activists supporting them from the outside, and for the brutal logic against it, voiced by the operators of these games, who believe them to be a deterrent to crime, a form of absolution for those who otherwise do not deserve it \u2014 and, conveniently, a source of their own personal enrichment.",
      "A writer who was up to the ideological but not the emotional task of such a novel might have settled for thinner characters. But Adjei-Brenyah, flitting from perspective to perspective in brisk chapters, assumes all of them easily and fills the characters\u2019 inner lives to the brim, especially those of the incarcerated. These people navigate their feelings of permeating, heartbreaking guilt, but also their wellness routines, fickle romances, creaky joints, fading memories of civilian life, inane daydreams. The society in which they live defines them by their worst deeds, but the writer of this novel refuses to.",

      "Rabbi Harold Kushner, a practical public theologian whose best-selling books assured readers that bad things happen to good people because God is endowed with unlimited love and justice but exercises only finite power to prevent evil, died on Thursday in Canton, Mass. He was 88.",
      "His death, in hospice care, was confirmed by his daughter, Ariel Kushner Haber.",
      "Several of Rabbi Kushner\u2019s 14 books became best-sellers, resonating well beyond his Conservative Jewish congregation outside Boston and across religious boundaries in part because they had been inspired by his own experiences with grief, doubt and faith. One reviewer called his book \u201cWhen All You\u2019ve Ever Wanted Isn\u2019t Enough\u201d a \u201cuseful spiritual survival manual.\u201d",
      "Rabbi Kushner wrote \u201cWhen Bad Things Happen to Good People\u201d (1981) after the death of his son, Aaron. At age 3, just hours after the birth of the Kushners\u2019 daughter, Aaron was diagnosed with a rare disease, progeria, in which the body ages rapidly.",
      "When Aaron was 10 years old, he was in his 60s physiologically. He weighed only 25 pounds and was as tall as a three-year-old when he died in 1977 two days after his 14th birthday.",
      "\u201cLike a lot of children who feel they\u2019re going to die soon, he was afraid he would be forgotten because he didn\u2019t live long enough, not knowing parents never forget,\u201d Rabbi Kushner told the alumni magazine ",
      " in 2008. \u201cI promised I\u2019d tell his story.\u201d",
      "The book was rejected by two publishers before it was accepted by Shocken Books. It catapulted to No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list and transformed Rabbi Kushner into a popular author and commentator.",
      "\u201cIt was my very first inkling of how much suffering was out there, all over the world, that religion was not coping with,\u201d he told ",
      " in 1996.",
      "His thesis, as he wrote in the book, was straightforward: \u201cIt becomes much easier to take God seriously as the source of moral values if we don\u2019t hold Him responsible for all the unfair things that happen in the world.\u201d",
      "Rabbi Kushner also wrote:",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why one person gets sick, and another does not, but I can only assume that some natural laws which we don\u2019t understand are at work. I cannot believe that God \u2018sends\u2019 illness to a specific person for a specific reason. I don\u2019t believe in a God who has a weekly quota of malignant tumors to distribute, and consults His computer to find out who deserves one most or who could handle it best.",
      "\u201c\u2018What did I do to deserve this?\u2019 is an understandable outcry from a sick and suffering person, but it is really the wrong question. Being sick or being healthy is not a matter of what God decides that we deserve. The better question is, \u2018If this has happened to me, what do I do now, and who is there to help me do it?\u2019\u201d",
      "He was making the case that dark corners of the universe endure where God has not yet succeeded in making order out of chaos. \u201cAnd chaos is evil; not wrong, not malevolent, but evil nonetheless,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause by causing tragedies at random, it prevents people from believing in God\u2019s goodness.\u201d",
      "Unpersuaded, the journalist, critic and novelist Ron Rosenbaum, writing in The New York Times Magazine in 1995, reduced Rabbi Kushner\u2019s thesis more dialectically: \u201cdiminishing God to something less than an Omnipotent Being \u2014 to something more like an eager cheerleader for good, but one decidedly on the sidelines in the struggle against evil.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn effect,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe need to join Him in rooting for good \u2014 our job is to help cheer Him up.\u201d",
      "Rabbi Kushner argued, however, that God was omnipotent as a wellspring of empathy and love.",
      "Harold Samuel Kushner was born on April 3, 1935, to Julius and Sarah (Hartman) Kushner in the East New York section of Brooklyn. His mother was a homemaker. His father owned Playmore Publishing, which sold toys and children\u2019s books, especially Bible stories, from a shop at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street that he hoped his son would take over. Harold felt he lacked his father\u2019s business sense.",
      "\u201cThe only thing worse than competing with my father and failing would be competing with him and outdoing him,\u201d ",

      "He was raised in Brooklyn (the family moved to the Crown Heights section when he started elementary school), where he was a passionate Brooklyn Dodgers fan. After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Columbia University in 1955 and a master\u2019s there in 1960.",
      "He had planned to major in psychology but switched to literature after studying under Prof. Mark Van Doren, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. On a lark, but armed with a solid religious upbringing, he enrolled in an evening program at the Jewish Theological Seminary. By his junior year at Columbia he had decided to become a rabbi.",
      "After Columbia, he enrolled full-time at the seminary where he was ordained, graduated in 1960 and received his doctorate in 1972. He studied later at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.",
      "He volunteered for two years in the Army\u2019s Chaplain Corps at Fort Sill, Okla., where he became a first lieutenant. Returning to New York after his discharge, he served for four years as an assistant rabbi at Temple Israel in Great Neck, N.Y., on Long Island.",
      "Rabbi Kushner married Suzette Estrada in 1960 and moved to Massachusetts, where he became rabbi of Temple Israel in Natick, a suburb of Boston, in 1966. He served as the congregational rabbi there for 24 years and remained a member of the congregation until he moved into a senior living residence in Canton in 2017.",
      " in 2022. His brother, Paul, a rabbi in Bellmore and Merrick on Long Island, died in 2019. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by two grandchildren.",
      "Among Rabbi Kushner\u2019s other books are \u201cHow Good Do We Have to Be? A New Understanding of Guilt and Forgiveness\u201d (1997), \u201cLiving a Life That Matters\u201d (2001) and \u201cThe Lord Is My Shepherd: Healing Wisdom of the 23rd Psalm\u201d (2003).",
      "He also collaborated with the novelist ",
      " in editing \u201cEtz Hayim: A Torah Commentary,\u201d the official commentary of Conservative Jewish congregations, which was published by the Rabbinical Assembly and the Jewish Publication Society in 2001.",
      "Rabbi Kushner often said he was amazed at the breadth of his readership across theological lines. In 1999, he was named clergyman of the year by the organization Religion in American Life. In 2007, the Jewish Book Council gave him a Lifetime Achievement Award.",
      "In his books, other writings and on-air commentary, often as a radio and television talk show guest, he became a font of aphorisms embraced by clergy of all denominations.

      "Ms. France, who goes by Kim, agreed to the plan, but told Mr. Green that his search would uncover her age, which wasn\u2019t listed on the app. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m older than you,\u201d she texted him days before their April 10 meeting in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park. He had no problem with that and fired back a caveat of his own: \u201cI\u2019m fat,\u201d he texted.",
      "By the time the sun was filtering through the windows of her Prospect Heights apartment on April 11, they were a couple.",
      "The careers of Ms. France and Mr. Green churn up plenty for internet sleuthing. In 1999, Ms. France, 59, was the founding editor of the Cond\u00e9 Nast shopping magazine Lucky. Today she is a writer and a host of the podcast \u201c",

      "Mr. Green\u2019s list of red flags was purely musical \u2014 and included anyone expressing a predilection for jam bands. \u201cIf you liked Zac Brown Band or Dave Matthews Band, it was a straight-up deal breaker for me,\u201d he said. He based his \u201csuper like\u201d of Ms. France on her list of favorite Spotify artists, which included the rock bands Yo La Tengo and the Velvet Underground.",
      "Ms. France, on the other hand, had been screening her potential matches for peacocking. \u201cIf a guy had a picture of himself on a private jet; if he had a picture of himself at the gym; if he had a picture of himself with a celebrity \u2014 those were all automatic swipe lefts,\u201d she said. Mr. Green barely squeaked under the limbo stick. \u201cPaul had a picture of himself with Devo.\u201d Out of respect for that band, she let her celebrity rule slide.",
      "Ms. France had never heard of Paul Green\u2019s School of Rock, the company Mr. Green founded in 2000 in his native Philadelphia, when they matched. She associated the name \u201cSchool of Rock\u201d with ",
      ". Mr. Green was used to that. When the film was released, friends and colleagues pointed out similarities between his school and the fictionalized one, and overlaps between his personality and the character played by Mr. Black. But its producers denied Paul Green\u2019s School of Rock was a model or influence. He considered suing.",

      "Mr. Green grew up poor. His father, Jack Green, died in a car accident when he was 2. His mother, Margaret Green, was an amateur musician and taught him guitar. Their income came from Social Security checks. When he was 15, he dropped out of high school and moved in with a group of nearby musician friends. He played in local bands, but, at 23, found he liked teaching guitar better. His mother died of cancer a year after he established the School of Rock.",
      "Ms. Green lived long enough to see him get married the first time, in 1999, to a bandmate. After a legal separation, that marriage ended in divorce in 2022. Mr. Green has two children \u2014 a son, 20, and a daughter, 16. He finished high school with a G.E.D. the same year he started teaching guitar and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy in 2001. In 2021, he earned a law degree from Temple University. Law had long been an interest and is now an avocation; he has never taken the bar exam.",

She was drawn to fashion from a young age \u2014 before Lucky, she helped edit the fashion pages at New York Magazine \u2014 but she didn\u2019t love fashion magazines. \u201cI was suspicious of them because they made women feel bad about themselves.\u201d",

      "In 1987, she graduated from Oberlin College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in creative writing. Her father, Hugh France, died of esophageal cancer in 1986. Her mother, Eve France, and two brothers, one older and one younger, later moved to New York City, where they still live.",
      "The Googling that preceded Ms. France and Mr. Green\u2019s meet-up in the park in 2021 was no guarantee of a connection. Though both were still recovering from what Mr. Green called \u201cfounder\u2019s disease\u201d \u2014 \u201cKim and I both watched something we made become something different, something more capitalistic than cultural,\u201d he said \u2014 seeing each other involved a significant commute. Mr. Green was still living in Philadelphia. (Each had expanded their search radius on Tinder after disappointing dates in their own cities.)",
      "After they sat down to talk on a Prospect Park bench, however, long-distance dating seemed scalable \u2014 and worth it, to both. When Ms. France suggested they go to her place to listen to records, Mr. Green asked her if they could kiss first. More kissing came after she made him ",

      "Mr. Green might have landed a spot in the romantic record books, if such a thing existed, before he left Prospect Heights late that night. \u201cPaul requested exclusivity on the first date, \u2018while we figure out what this is,\u2019 he said, making him the first man in the history of Tinder to do such a thing,\u201d Ms. France said.",
      "Her response: Yes, please. \u201cAfter dating so many commitment-phobic, ghosting men on the apps, I felt like I had stepped into a different dimension on the space-time continuum.\u201d",
      "A Snow White phase \u2014 \u201clike I was in a garden with butterflies flying around me and little birds tweeting,\u201d she said \u2014 followed. Mr. Green felt he had hit the love jackpot, too.",
      "\u201cWhen we Googled each other and I saw all these great pictures of Kim with cool people and then I started reading her writing, I was already three-quarters of the way there,\u201d he said. The other quarter was in place before April 13, 2021, when he stuffed two trash bags full of his belongings into his car and moved into her place.",
      "They had been a couple for three days. They had seen each other in person exactly once. But \u201cI had told him at some point, you can come here whenever you want, and he took me extremely literally,\u201d Ms. France said.",
      "Ms. France and Mr. Green still live in the same apartment. Three weeks into living together, both knew they wanted to marry. Three months in, they started talking about it. Ms. France mentioned that a proposal involving a drum line would be nice. Mr. Green felt that was something he could make happen, which explains why, for several months, he kept the engagement ring they picked out together in his car\u2019s glove compartment. \u201cIf I got the drum line together, it would be ready,\u201d he explained.",
      "He never got the drum line together. Instead, on Nov. 18, 2022, during a weekend trip to Philadelphia, he told her he forgot something in the glove box and asked her to look. They celebrated her yes with lunch on the road.",
      "Ms. France and Mr. Green were married in her mother\u2019s Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan on April 15. The run-up featured neither fashion runways nor rock concerts. \u201cWe both wanted something really chill,\u201d Ms. France said. \u201cNo big production.\u201d",
      "Ms. France wore a floor-length black dress by Zero + Maria Cornejo; Mr. Green wore a black Michael Kors suit. Shirim Nothenberg, Ms. France\u2019s sister-in-law, was ordained by the Universal Life Church to marry them. Fifty guests, including Mr. Green\u2019s children, several of his students and Ms. Romolini, Ms. France\u2019s \u201cEverything is Fine\u201d co-host, attended. Ms. Nothenberg kept her remarks brief. Like everyone else in the room, she wanted to hear from the couple. \u201cThey\u2019re both clever, funny, insightful people,\u201d she said.",
      "In handwritten vows they co-wrote and took turns reading to each other, Ms. France and Mr. Green said they promised to take \u201cexquisite care\u201d of each other, and \u201cto think you are the best, so long as we both may live.\u201d",
      "Those who wanted to hear the song they cued up to play the moment they were pronounced husband and wife, ",
      " were mostly out of luck. \u201cWe played it, but people were cheering so loud for us it got drowned out,\u201d Mr. Green said.",
      "Ms. France distilled the key to their quick-to-ignite but enduring love this way: \u201cThe reason it works is we both think we\u2019re the one who got lucky.\u201d",
      " April 15, 2023",
      " Eve France\u2019s Manhattan apartment",
      " Ms. France said she surprised herself during the ceremony. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to focus, because whenever you host a party, you feel frenetic,\u201d she said. But that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cIt\u2019s a corny thing to say, but I really did feel like we were the only two people in the room.\u201d Mr. Green was likewise undistracted. \u201cWhen she said, \u2018You may kiss the bride,\u2019 the rest of the world melted away,\u201d he said.",
      " At a reception in the apartment that was meant to feel more like a cocktail party, guests nibbled hors d\u2019oeuvres and passed small plates. The signature cocktail, a spicy margarita, was a particular hit. Creative Edge Parties handled catering, including a non-cake chocolate dessert that looked like a terrarium in a cup."

      "\u201cSince bridal gowns can now be seen all over social media, brides are wanting something different that makes their wedding gown more unique,\u201d said the designer Monique Lhuillier. \u201cMatching boleros, detachable sleeves and overskirts are quite popular, allowing brides to transform their look from ceremony to reception.\u201d",

      "Many brides love the idea of a strapless gown, but the neckline can often be ill-fitting, uncomfortable and cause an exaggerated bulge under the arms. Enter the peaked bodice, which provides additional support and cleverly smooths problem areas for a more polished look. ",

      "Legislation that allows any layperson to perform a marriage on a given day in New York may not seem like a top priority in Albany. And in reality, this assumption appears to be correct: It took 16 years for legislation on a one-day designation ",
      ".",
      "But for many, the new law, which went into effect March 28, was long overdue.",
      "Previously, only ordained members of the clergy and certain government officials had been permitted to solemnize a marriage in New York. In some counties, including the five counties of New York City, people can become ordained ministers online through platforms like Universal Life Church or American Marriage Ministries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be offering a new service,\u201d said Michael McSweeney, the city clerk who oversees the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really enhance the experience for people who want to have that special loved one officiate at their ceremony without having to take the step of becoming an ordained minister of a church.\u201d",
      "Marriages performed by officiants ordained online are not legally recognized in some of the state\u2019s counties, including Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester. The new law helps couples getting married in New York avoid misunderstandings regarding the validity of nontraditional ministers.",
      "While going through a divorce, some couples found out that they had never been legally married all along. ",
      " discovered in a case by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court that their marriage and prenuptial agreement were void because the officiant had been a Universal Life Church minister.",
      "In 2006, Sandra Galef, then a Democratic assemblywoman from Ossining, N.Y., first proposed legislation on a one-day designation for a clear alternative. Such a measure passed last year, and Gov. Kathy Hochul signed it into law on Dec. 28, 2022.",
      "One-day officiants do not have to be New York State residents, but they must be at least 18 years old. ",
      "More than 40 percent of couples in the United States are married by non-clergy, Ms. Galef said in a press announcement. California, Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island all have similar laws that allow an individual to become a marriage officiant for one day.",
      "The one-day designation was an attractive option for Ray Lyn Eddington and Michael Joseph Batal because it is free from religious associations. They are getting married on April 28 on a terrace at the William Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s either city hall, a clergyperson or an ordained minister,\u201d Ms. Eddington, a doula from Brooklyn, said. \u201cBut if there are questions about ordained ministers being legal in some towns, then what do you do? This is a great option.\u201d (Mr. Batal is from Westchester, and they had initially considered getting married there.)",
      "Mr. Batal, who manages money for a private family, found out about the new law while researching ways to get a friend to officiate a wedding. He had previously officiated his brother\u2019s wedding in Massachusetts with a one-day license 20 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt brought back fond memories,\u201d he said.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal wanted Elizabeth Barnes to officiate their wedding because she had set the two up on a blind date in December 2019. They asked her on April 8, which was her 20-year anniversary of being cancer free, if she could perform their marriage.",
      "\u201cI started crying because all the things in life that you fight so hard for,\u201d said Ms. Barnes, a founder of two restaurants in New York, London Lennie\u2019s and Saltaire Oyster Bar. She has been Mr. Batal\u2019s longtime neighbor in Rye, N.Y. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that I could be there and not miss it and do it.\u201d",
      "Briana Myers, a philanthropies manager from Brooklyn, also received a one-day license from the Manhattan Marriage Bureau for Christie Mattson and Oliver Chan\u2019s April 22 wedding at Dumbo Loft in Brooklyn. The couple asked Ms. Myers to officiate because she had done some standup comedy shows. The couple wanted to commemorate the bride\u2019s father, who died and had been known for his dad jokes at family weddings. So, Ms. Myers told a few dad jokes at the ceremony in memory of Ms. Mattson\u2019s father.",
      "Out of excitement, Ms. Myers got ordained by the Universal Life Church immediately after the couple asked her to officiate in February 2022. The next step would have been to register her ordination at the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, but thanks to the new law, she didn\u2019t have to. The one-day license was more \u201cfit for purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to marry a whole bunch of other people or, set up my own place of worship.\u201d",
      "Ms. Myers said the process was much easier. \u201cIt was one form and it took five minutes.\u201d",
      "After a couple obtains a marriage license from their town or city clerk office, the officiant must apply for the one-day license at the same office and pay a $25 fee. They do not need to apply in person and can mail in the completed documents.",
      "In New York City, officiants must apply to the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, regardless of the borough in which the couple received their marriage license. They can either download the ",
      ", fill it out and sign it in front of a notary public, and mail it to the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Or, they could ",
      ", bring identification and fill out the paperwork in the office and receive the license on the spot. Each county may have a different setup, so the best first step is to visit the appropriate town or city clerk\u2019s website for guidelines.",
      "Within five days after the ceremony, the officiant must mail back the one-day license attached to the marriage license.",
      "The clerk at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau provides licensees with a script to read during the ceremony. Ms. Myers said she used \u201cthe legal sounding parts of the script\u201d during Ms. Mattson and Mr. Chan\u2019s wedding because of her \u201clack of qualifications\u201d in solemnizing a marriage.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal appreciated the personal touch that their officiant brought to their nuptials.",
      "\u201cSo much better having such a special ceremony conducted by a dear friend who didn\u2019t need to be ordained, instead of a stranger,\u201d Mr. Batal said."

      "For three weeks after they matched on Hinge in February 2020, Jhana\u00eb K-C Bonnick and Patrick Sean McDonnell tried to make plans to meet, but both were too busy with their jobs in theater. Then the ",
      " began and everything shut down.",
      "Their first date, on March 19, was a viewing of the film \u201cAlways Be My Maybe\u201d using Teleparty (formerly Netflix Party), an extension that allows subscribers in different places to watch TV shows or movies on the streaming service at the same time.",
      "Soon they were texting each other every day. At the time, Ms. Bonnick, a Broadway stage manager, lived in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, and had no work since all the theaters had shut down. She has asthma, so she was nervous about catching Covid-19. \u201cI was in my apartment with my roommate and her cats, just hanging out for a long time,\u201d she said. Mr. McDonnell was working remotely for New York Theater Workshop as a special projects associate, and living with his parents in Carle Place, N.Y., where he grew up.",
      "In search of a novel virtual activity for them to try, Mr. McDonnell came across the \u201c",
      ".\u201d (These are part of a study developed by psychologists to investigate conversations that can build intimacy between two strangers.) In mid-April, he suggested that for their first Zoom date, they ask each other the first 12.",
      "\u201cI was like, lead to \u2026 what?\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. \u201cI\u2019m panicking, texting my friends. What does this mean?\u201d",
      "Over the course of three consecutive Saturdays, they went through the entire list. Each conversation lasted around three hours.",
      "\u201cIt works,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. \u201cWe fell in love.\u201d",
      "Mr. McDonnell said he appreciated that Ms. Bonnick \u201cwas willing to answer everything with a lot of vulnerability and thoughtfulness.\u201d",
      "Recently, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell looked through the text messages they sent each other during those early months. \u201cWe were there for each other through the really weird parts of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      "They found ways to connect outside of the digital world, too. At one point, Ms. Bonnick, who rarely cooked or baked, mailed Mr. McDonnell a tin of homemade snickerdoodle cookies with a handwritten note. \u201cShe baked the cookies, she went to the post office in the middle of the pandemic, went to the trouble to overnight ship them,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cThat was the first time I thought, Is this what being in love is like?\u201d",
      "The note Ms. Bonnick sent with the cookies began a tradition that they still keep up with. Every month, on the anniversary of their first date, on March 19, Ms. Bonnick leaves a Post-it note for Mr. McDonnell to find. And Mr. McDonnell writes her notes during the run of each show she works on. (For their wedding, Ms. Bonnick made Mr. McDonnell a box full of notes and photos, and he wrote her a letter and made a digital album of 36 photos, one from every month they had been dating.)",
      "After more than three months of dating from afar, they finally met in person on Memorial Day, at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. \u201cWe talked for a long time,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. When they were saying goodbye, both were wearing masks and didn\u2019t know how to end the meeting physically. \u201cIn normal times, it would be a \u2018Do we kiss now?\u2019\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Instead, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a weird pause, and Patrick goes, \u2018Is it OK if we hug?\u2019\u201d Disappointed, Ms. Bonnick went home and told her roommate, \u201cWell, that was nice while it lasted.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick was convinced that the hug signified coldness, but she was misreading the signs. Soon after, Mr. McDonnell texted her as usual, and their romance continued. They began seeing each other regularly in person.",
      "That summer delivered a series of painful challenges that solidified their commitment to each other.",
      "Since receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater arts from State University of New York at New Paltz in 2014, Ms. Bonnick, 30, has worked in theater. In 2016, she had her big break as the production assistant for \u201cHadestown\u201d at the show\u2019s Off Broadway debut at New York Theater Workshop. She went on to work on shows like \u201cThe Cherry Orchard,\u201d \u201cCaroline, or Change\u201d and, more recently, \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d But several months into the pandemic, she was wondering if her career in theater was over. All she could think, she said, was \u201cI\u2019ve spent five years investing in something that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d",
      "She was facing challenges on a personal level as well. In late spring 2020, Ms. Bonnick\u2019s maternal grandfather, Joseph Johnson, died, and in August, her paternal grandfather, Keith Bonnick, also died. The Black Lives Matter protests that began in late May raised difficult emotions for Ms. Bonnick. And she and her roommate found out on short notice that they had to move out of their apartment.",
      "Mr. McDonnell, 28, who received a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater from Brooklyn College in 2017, had held on to his job for the New York Theater Workshop when the pandemic began. He is currently working full time as a security guard at Madison Square Garden.",
      "That summer, he faced a major health scare. \u201cI had a massive tumor growing along the side of my jaw,\u201d he said. \u201cIt started the size of a pea and by summer it was the size of a golf ball. I started going for tests. In mid-August, I had surgery to remove it.\u201d When he went in for a follow-up, the doctors told him that the lump had been an extremely rare form of cancer called secretory carcinoma. \u201cLuckily it was a clean removal,\u201d he said.",
      "Also that summer, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s grandfather on his father\u2019s side, James McDonnell, died, an event that deeply affected his family.",
      "Throughout it all, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell leaned on each other. He came to Manhattan regularly to join the Black Lives Matter protests or to help out at New York Theater Workshop, which, along with other theaters, decided to open its lobby to give protesters a place to drink water, use the bathrooms or just rest. In the evenings, he would head to Ms. Bonnick\u2019s apartment and stay overnight.",
      "That summer \u201cwas one of the ways I knew and felt very confident that the relationship was built to last,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cWe spent time together either navigating these things directly or hanging out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we wanted an escape, we could have an escape. If we wanted to plan, we could plan. If we just wanted to be safe, we could comfort each other. There wasn\u2019t any tension between us.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick said that all of the challenges they faced that summer, along with having started a relationship talking on the phone or texting and having done the 36 questions early on, built a foundation of constant communication. Check-ins became a norm. \u201cWe don\u2019t really fight now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t disagree. If we disagree, we\u2019re just having a different kind of conversation.\u201d",
      "Last summer, they started floating the idea of marriage. For Mr. McDonnell, the month of July carries particular significance. On July 2, 2008, when he was 13, Mr. McDonnell almost drowned at Jones Beach. The situation was dire enough that a helicopter evacuated him to a nearby hospital and he was kept there overnight. \u201cAround that time every year I think about what it means to be alive and to have been so close to death,\u201d he said. \u201cLast July, I knew I wanted to be married to her and I didn\u2019t want to wait much longer.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick agreed. So that August, Mr. McDonnell arranged an outing in Port Washington, N.Y., with Ms. Bonnick\u2019s parents, Karen and Hugh Bonnick; her brother Jalel Bonnick; his parents, Laura and Peter McDonnell; his aunt and uncle, Linda and Greg Pietrzak; and his cousin Jeffrey Pietrzak. His plan to propose on the dock as the sun set was almost thwarted when the arrival of Ms. Bonnick\u2019s family from Staatsburg, N.Y., where her parents live, was delayed. Luckily, they made it, with 20 minutes to spare before nightfall.",
      "\u201cHe got down on one knee at the waterfront during sunset and asked me to marry him,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Afterward, the two families, who were meeting for the first time, went for dinner nearby at Finn MacCool\u2019s.",
      "Choosing New York Theater Workshop as the venue for the wedding was easy. Mr. McDonnell worked at the theater for four years, and Ms. Bonnick worked on four shows there, including \u201cHadestown\u201d and \u201cSlave Play.\u201d \u201cThat was where we launched our careers and met many of our friends,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. (They never met through work, though Mr. McDonnell knew of Ms. Bonnick.)",
      "On March 19, 2023, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell were wed in the theater\u2019s rehearsal room in front of 44 guests. Their friend, Yang-Yang Chen, who was ordained by Open Ministry, officiated. They asked guests to test for Covid-19 if they felt unwell.",
      "When choosing the date for the wedding, Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick quickly settled on March 19, their anniversary and a Sunday this year. But what they didn\u2019t count on was Ms. Bonnick\u2019s work schedule.",
      "After the 10:30 a.m. ceremony and a brunch featuring mimosas, crepe cakes from Lady M Cake Boutique, and a coffee truck, Ms. Bonnick rushed across Manhattan, from Fourth Street to the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on West 46th Street, for a 3 p.m. preview performance of \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d Ms. Bonnick, the show\u2019s assistant stage manager, walked in wearing a white, ankle-length JessaKae dress with puff sleeves. \u201cAll of my friends, the whole stage management team, were screaming,\u201d she said. Afterward, she said, \u201cI checked the props in my wedding dress.\u201d",
      "After the show, she met Mr. McDonnell and a small group of friends and family for dinner at Dim Sum Palace on Second Avenue. At some point, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell realized that besides being their anniversary, March 19 was also the last day of winter this year. \u201cIt was the perfect time for a new beginning,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      " March 19, 2023",
      " New York Theater Workshop, New York",
      "Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick will take each other\u2019s last names, both becoming Bonnick-McDonnell. It was an \u201cimportant statement of values for us, another marker of the commitment we are making together,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said.",
      "As part of the ceremony, the couple asked guests to read passages of a poem called \u201cA Spell for Reclaiming the Moment\u201d by Adrienne Maree Brown. Ms. Bonnick\u2019s close friend and former roommate, Madeleine Foster Bersin, read a passage from ",
      "\u2019s \u201cAll About Love: New Visions.\u201d \u201cWe wanted a balance between it feeling like a traditional ceremony and it feeling distinctly our own,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said.",
      " For their rings, the couple chose aquamarine, the birthstone for March."

      "Well, that was anticlimactic.",
      "Almost 30 years after he transformed Gucci, seemingly overnight, from a bourgeois leather brand to the hottest thing in fashion, ultimately making it into the cornerstone of the luxury group PPR (now Kering); about 20 years after he ",
      " by walking away from that job, as well as from his post at the top of Yves Saint Laurent, and announced he was going to make movies (and then made a ",
      "); 13 years after he ",
      ", this time under his own name; and about five months after he and his business partner, Domenico De Sole, ",
      " to Est\u00e9e Lauder for almost $3 billion, Tom Ford may be finally saying farewell to fashion. This time, most likely, for real.",
      "On Wednesday, he dropped a surprise \u201cfinal collection\u201d (according to a news release) in the form of three short videos by the photographer Steven Klein. They feature a bevy of supermodels (Amber Valletta, Karlie Kloss, Karen Elson, Joan Smalls) wearing archive designs from Mr. Ford\u2019s last 13 years and variously writhing, strutting and otherwise emoting while trapped in a series of glass boxes. Outside, the designer himself, in signature dark suit, white shirt and dark glasses, walks by alone, barely visible in the dimness, occasionally pausing to lift a hand and direct.",
      "The videos came unaccompanied by any statement, and Mr. Ford declined requests for comment. Neither Est\u00e9e Lauder nor Zegna, which has the license for Tom Ford fashion, could be reached for comment.",
      "Still, the collection answered the question that had been hanging over the brand since its sale in November: Would Mr. Ford stay or go? And it cleared the way for a new designer. Rumor has it that Peter Hawkings, Mr. Ford\u2019s longtime men\u2019s wear designer, is getting the job.",
      "But the final collection reveal also offered a marked contrast to Mr. Ford\u2019s last grand goodbye, when he ",
      ". That one took place before a live audience, some of its members in tears, as Mr. Ford took a bow, rose petals fell from the sky (OK, the ceiling) and a standing ovation filled the room.",
      "And it made for an oddly subdued exit for a man who once stood astride fashion like a stubbled colossus, and who did more than anyone else to mothball the old idea of a designer and shepherd in the era of the creative director \u2014 who really created the whole concept of creative director in the first place.",
      "To a certain extent, it makes sense that Mr. Ford would want to stage-manage his own leaving imagery. Why not, when you can control every detail? Why let others have the final word (or look) on your career? He has nothing left to prove in fashion \u2014 building a billion-dollar brand in just over a decade on the strength of a name is an unprecedented feat. He doesn\u2019t have to feed the beast anymore. And he is a filmmaker, after all, who now lives in Los Angeles.",
      "Still, as a closing statement on style, the final collection seemed less like a collection than a metaphor.",
      "The clothes themselves were the least of the matter. They were a tour through Mr. Ford\u2019s favorite Tom Fordisms: the white, jersey goddess gown; the leopard, sequined lounge suit; the lace-and-velvet L.B.D.; the smoking; the crystal pasties. There was fringe and snakeskin and the occasional breastplate \u2014 the potent mix of sex and power and self-aware shtick that emerged from Halston and Saint Laurent antecedents and defined his aesthetic.",
      "That\u2019s OK, given that the clothes themselves (at least the women\u2019s wear) often seemed the least of the matter when it came to Tom Ford-the-brand. They were more like an epilogue to his Gucci-YSL years, cycling through some of the greatest hits, hitting them with a dose of Botox to iron out the wrinkles and then juicing them with glitz and athleisure \u2014 and glitzy athleisure \u2014 to make them relevant to a social media, pandemic world. TF-the-brand was powered more by beauty and fragrance than fashion (that\u2019s why Lauder bought it, as opposed to, say, Kering) and the strength of Mr. Ford\u2019s ability to sell the vaporous promise contained within.",
      "Back in the day, when Mr. Ford started Act II of his post-Gucci fashion, he held his debut TF show in his first store on Madison Avenue and forbade smartphones and all photographers except Terry Richardson. (It was 2010; Mr. Richardson hadn\u2019t been canceled yet.) Only 100 people were invited, and they were squeezed into little gold ballroom chairs.",
      "The models \u2014 all of them women who inspired Mr. Ford, like Rita Wilson, Beyonc\u00e9 and Gigi Hadid \u2014 were so close that their clothes practically brushed everyone\u2019s knees. The point being, Mr. Ford said at the time, to make it personal. \u201cI do not understand everyone\u2019s need to see everything online the day after a show,\u201d he told ",
      ". He had returned to offer something else.",
      "From the vantage point of now, it looks as if Mr. Ford were Don Quixote, tilting at those windmills. That\u2019s the message the final videos seem to convey, anyway: a cri de coeur about the changing fashion world and the status of women, with the designer at a remove, looking in at a scene playing out in a cage of its own making, no longer interested in the fight. The women behind the glass don\u2019t look happy; they look pent-up and addled and upset.",
      "Karen Elson sings an aria; Amber Valletta is in tears. The requiem seems not for Mr. Ford but for the end of the world as he knew it. Or dreamed it. He leaves it fading not into the sunset, but into the darkness."

    "author": "Joseph Bernstein",
    "publication_date": "2023-04-28T05:00:21-04:00",

      "At an N.B.A. game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks on March 17, Hasbulla Magomedov got the full celebrity treatment. He chatted pregame with the Mavericks star Luka Doncic, who posed with him for a photo.",
      "When Hasbulla\u2019s face appeared on the Jumbotron, the crowd went wild. And, like everyone who\u2019s anyone, he sat courtside at the Staples Center, with one major difference: He was perched on his friend\u2019s lap. Hasbulla, 20, is a little over three feet tall, and it gave him a better view of the action.",
      "An unlikely global superstar, Hasbulla (as with Madonna or Pel\u00e9, no one uses his last name) has said that doctors have never given him a definitive diagnosis for the condition that causes his short stature.",
      "Hasbulla is famous for his videos and livestreams, which are part \u201cJackass\u201d",
      "and part vlogging, and he speculated in a 2021 interview that he is so popular because he is a \u201csmall and rare\u201d person.",
      "Hasbulla is from Dagestan, a tiny, poor republic of Russia in the North Caucasus, and is a celebrity in the world of mixed martial arts, though he has never officially thrown a competitive elbow. He doesn\u2019t speak English and turns down most endorsements because of his religious beliefs. (He is Muslim, like most Dagestanis.) During a time of acute geopolitical tension between the West and Russia, he has amassed an enormous Western fan base. And his inner circle is a well-meaning but ragtag group that includes a family friend from Dagestan, a Dagestani-American software developer and a fan from the Hasbulla Discord server.",
      "\u201cWe love him,\u201d said John Shahidi, the president of Full Send/Nelk, a ",
      " that has collaborated with Hasbulla and arranged his recent American trip. \u201cWe were crying at the airport when he left.\u201d",
      "But his fame, for some, is a reminder of the ugly ways little people have been used as entertainment for centuries.",
      "Hasbulla is an influencer, so what he does, exactly, is a little hard to explain. On his Instagram account (8.6 million followers) Hasbulla indulges his passions for shooting guns, driving fast cars, practicing fighting moves and playing pranks. (Many people who don\u2019t know his name may know his face as a meme signifying something like \u201cmirth,\u201d or \u201chigh jinks.\u201d) Fans also follow along as he eats salad, messes around with face filters and speaks Dagestani Russian.",
      "Through an interpreter, Hasbulla said in an interview over text message that he thought so many people loved his videos \u201cbecause I make them happy and smile.\u201d",
      "Hasbulla\u2019s popularity radiates out from a kind of extended Gen Z bro universe in which U.F.C., the mixed martial arts organization, is a dominant force. Its emissaries include the fresh-faced Nelk Boys (Full Send\u2019s fratty prankster stars) and the ",
      ", who is currently under house arrest in Romania, where he is being investigated after being accused of human trafficking, rape and organized crime. Hasbulla\u2019s most prominent fans reflect this culture\u2019s very online mash-up of right wing politics and mainstream pop culture: former President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Donald Trump Jr., but also Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Drake.",
      "Some of his biggest fans say they were first drawn to \u201cHasbik\u201d \u2014 his Russian diminutive \u2014 when they realized he was not a child, and that they\u2019re inspired that he has such a winning attitude. Critics say that framing is patronizing, and that Hasbulla\u2019s renown demeans other little people. They argue it places him in an ignominious tradition of famous little people who are there, ultimately, for the amusement of everyone else.",
      "\u201cSo often in these cases the only reason that someone rises to this level of fame is purely based on their size and the ableist world\u2019s infantilization,\u201d said Mark Povinelli, an actor with dwarfism, who is the president of the Little People of America.",
      "Dana White, the president of U.F.C., disagreed. \u201cThis kid, because of his personality and because everybody likes him, has had opportunities that most people all over the world will never have,\u201d he said. He added that Hasbulla \u201cis a human being who lives his own life and makes his own choices.\u201d",
      "Hasbulla rarely addresses his size. According to his interpreter, he hates the Russian word for \u201cdwarf.\u201d And in a 2021 Russian-language interview, he gave some insight into the way he thinks about his body.",
      "\u201cMy parents consider me as handicapped and the doctors as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "The son of a plumber, Hasbulla is from a gritty suburb of Makhachkala, Dagestan\u2019s capital, on the Western shore of the Caspian Sea. In an interview with the Full Send podcast, he said that he spent four years in an Islamic school, which he didn\u2019t like. According to Surkhay Sungurov, a Dagestani-American who advises Hasbulla and informally serves as his interpreter, Hasbulla convinced a friend to drive the 200 kilometers from Makhachkala to the school to help him escape.",
      "Shortly afterward, Mr. Sungurov said, Hasbulla started making videos.",
      "Among his early hits was ",
      ", sternly instructing a young person on a bicycle to go home in accordance with pandemic restrictions. Another popular video showed him ",
      ".",
      "But Hasbulla\u2019s real viral breakthrough came in 2021, when he and a Turkmen man with dwarfism participated in an interview meant to resemble a pre-fight news conference for an M.M.A. match. In the half-hour clip, the two men trade boasts and insults (Hasbulla calls his opponent a bad Muslim for endorsing online sports betting, and Hasbulla\u2019s opponent calls him a bad Muslim for swearing). Eventually they have to be separated in the classic stagy, weigh-in style.",
      "\u201cWho is this Russian kid who I can\u2019t even understand who is always messing with people and being a savage?\u201d Kyle Forgeard, one of the Nelk Boys, remembered thinking at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s the magic of Hasbulla.\u201d",
      "The clip drew eyeballs \u2014 it has been viewed 19 million times on YouTube \u2014 but also concern. It carried a whiff of the seedy burlesque of dwarf wrestling acts that were popular at large events like WrestleMania in the United States until the 1990s, but now more often take place in barrooms and county fairgrounds.",
      "Shortly after the clip went viral, Uliana Podpalnaya, the head of the Dwarf Athletic Association of Russia, raised her objections. \u201cThis is a show to make people laugh,\u201d she told Gazeta.Ru, a Russian newspaper.",
      "The fight between Hasbulla and the Turkmen man never happened, but Hasbulla acquired a nickname, \u201cMini Khabib,\u201d a reference to Khabib Nurmagomedov, the retired M.M.A. champion who is something like the Michael Jordan of Dagestan. Soon, athletes from the republic, which is wildly overrepresented in mixed martial arts, embraced him. At U.F.C. 267, in Abu Dhabi, the Dagestani fighter Islam Makhachev hoisted Hasbulla in the air immediately after a victory.",
      "Hasbulla quickly developed a shtick as a kind of slapstick pugilist \u2014 one of his trademarks is sucker punching people much larger than him \u2014 who is sometimes scooped up and held like a child by his friends.",
      "This made some observers uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cThe comments on his videos are always, \u2018he\u2019s so cute,\u2019\u201d said Erin Pritchard, a lecturer in disability and education at Liverpool Hope University. (Dr. Pritchard has dwarfism.) \u201cWell, but he\u2019s a man. They treat him like a child, they pick him up and sit him on their knee.\u201d",
      "Dr. Pritchard said that Hasbulla reminded her of Charles Stratton, the American with dwarfism who became an international star in the 19th century performing under the circus impresario P.T. Barnum as \u201cGeneral Tom Thumb.\u201d Mr. Stratton \u2014 an actor, singer, dancer and impersonator of mighty historical figures \u2014 was so famous that his wedding received ",
      ". President Lincoln hosted a wedding party for him.",
      "Western society dehumanizes little people, Dr. Pritchard said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a disabled person,\u201d she said, \u201cthey see a novelty.\u201d",
      "If there is a P.T. Barnum figure in Hasbulla\u2019s rise, it may be Mr. White, U.F.C.\u2019s boundary-pushing president. In October 2022, Mr. White signed Hasbulla to a multiyear contract, the terms of which have not been disclosed; the company sells Hasbulla merchandise, and he will appear as a playable character in a forthcoming U.F.C. video game.",
      "\u201cPeople are in awe of him. People love him,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star.\u201d",
      "But Mr. White and Hasbulla\u2019s team agree that he will never fight in a U.F.C. match.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll fight in the video game,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThat\u2019s about as close as he\u2019ll come to fighting.\u201d",
      "Ben Fowlkes, a longtime M.M.A. writer and podcaster, said he saw the U.F.C.\u2019s embrace of Hasbulla in the context of its other attempts to draw new fans through sideshows, such as Mr. White\u2019s \u201c",
      "\u201d competition, an innovation in which competitors, well, slap each other in the face. Hasbulla attended a March Power Slap event in Las Vegas, where the actor Mark Wahlberg asked Hasbulla to slap him; he declined.",
      "\u201cThe fight business is at its core a traveling carnival,\u201d Mr. Fowlkes said. \u201cThey have to show up in a new city every week, put the tent out and make a pitch. They don\u2019t do a lot of deep thinking about why people are looking.\u201d",
      "And a lot of people are looking. Hasbulla\u2019s first sit-down interview with a U.S. outlet, Barstool Sports in April 2022, has been watched 13 million times on YouTube. A recent video in which the Nelk Boys visit Hasbulla in Dagestan has 11 million views; a similar video about his American tour also has 11 million views.",
      "Hasbulla\u2019s team is trying to turn the frenzy of attention into a bankable brand. There is, of course, an official Hasbulla NFT, and there are mobile games in the works.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t always like to wake and go to meetings,\u201d said Justin Ozuna, who works in health care communications in San Antonio and is a member of the Hasbulla Discord who has joined Hasbulla\u2019s management. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t either when I was that age.\u201d",
      "Mr. Sungurov was more blunt: \u201cHe is not an easy person.\u201d",
      "Hasbulla, according to Mr. Sungurov, exerts an iron control over his Instagram account, frequently turning down the suggestions of his advisers about what to post. Mr. Forgeard said that Hasbulla spent much of the Lakers game looking at his Instagram analytics.",
      "Another area where Hasbulla won\u2019t budge is his religion. According to Mr. Ozuna, the team turned down a 21st birthday party for Hasbulla that the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas wanted to sponsor because Hasbulla doesn\u2019t drink, or take photos with female fans. And he declined an invitation to appear at this month\u2019s WrestleMania because he had plans to travel to Saudi Arabia for Ramadan.",
      "\u201cI have my own principles that I will not break for any money and fame,\u201d Hasbulla said, adding that he thought that was a core part of his appeal.",
      "Like other M.M.A. stars from Dagestan, Hasbulla has had to contend with the politics of his region. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya (which borders Dagestan), is an outspoken supporter of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, who has been ",
      " for his role in the invasion.",
      "He ",
      " in the Caucasus, and he and Hasbulla posed together for pictures in 2021. On Feb. 24, 2022, the first day of the Russian invasion, Hasbulla posted a picture on Twitter of himself atop a tank with a cryptic caption: \u201cThe peacemaker has arrived.\u201d",
      "Another political admirer of Hasbulla\u2019s is Mr. Bolsonaro, to whom Hasbulla wished \u201cgood luck\u201d in Brazil\u2019s 2022 election. (\u201cThank you, my big little buddy,\u201d Mr. ",
      ".)",
      "Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, the Hasbulla team spoke with the star about keeping politics out of his videos; his \u201cgood luck\u201d tweet has since been deleted.",
      "\u201cWe talked about, hey, let\u2019s focus on what people love about you, the entertainment,\u201d Mr. Ozuna said. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the things you love: religion, cars, cats, friends and family.\u201d",
      "There have been other hiccups. In December 2021, the Russian newspaper Lenta.ru reported that Hasbulla had been suspended from Instagram for threatening a woman he said had posted a clip of his sister online. And last month, Hasbulla aroused the ire of some social media commenters after sharing a ",
      " in which he slaps his cat. (The internet loves Hasbulla, but it will always love cats more.)",
      "Mr. Sungurov said it was a misunderstanding, and that Hasbulla was trying to teach the animal not to wander the streets of Makhachkala, where it could be menaced by feral cats.",
      "It\u2019s clear that Hasbulla doesn\u2019t always like the way he is treated by the public. While greeting fans at a U.F.C. event in Abu Dhabi, Hasbulla scolded a young man who pinched his cheek \u2014 an interaction that yielded a viral TikTok.",
      "\u201cPeople forget that he\u2019s an actual adult,\u201d a commenter wrote.",
      "And in the Barstool Sports interview, Hasbulla seemed to take exception when the host asked him if he was too big to watch cartoons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an adult,\u201d Hasbulla said. The host responded that he was also an adult and that he liked certain cartoons.",
      "\u201cProbably because your brain isn\u2019t fully developed,\u201d Hasbulla replied.",
      "It\u2019s possible Hasbulla is telling a joke that much of his audience isn\u2019t able to understand. According to Michael A. Reynolds, a professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University who ",
      ", Hasbulla\u2019s act may be a kind of affectionate sendup of the local stereotype of a \u201csuccessful Dagestani bro\u201d \u2014 posing with stacks of cash and lounging on private planes.",
      "Hasbulla\u2019s fame has certainly allowed him to live like a successful Dagestani bro. In a news conference, Mr. White, the U.F.C. boss, said that a recent merchandise collaboration between Nelk and Hasbulla netted the star $250,000.",
      "While Hasbulla said that many of his new toys \u2014 a Rolex, sports cars \u2014 are gifts, according to Mr. Sungurov, Hasbulla has used his own money to remodel his house, buy his father a car and pay for his brother\u2019s large wedding.",
      "As for Hasbulla\u2019s fans, whatever the level of irony their idol is working with, their reaction is simple. Kevin Lujano, an architectural designer in Arkansas who posts frequently about Hasbulla to Twitter, counts as one of his prized possession a hand-knit Hasbulla doll.",
      "\u201cHis videos can brighten my day, even if it\u2019s a really bad day,\u201d he said."

The collection will allow biographers an intimate look at one of the country\u2019s most celebrated literary couples. Mr. Dunne, a noted journalist and novelist, was Ms. Didion\u2019s closest collaborator, and the archive includes guest lists for their dinner parties, their edits of each other\u2019s manuscripts and screenplay drafts of films they wrote together like \u201c",

      "\u201cShe took entertaining seriously and was almost militaristic with her recipes,\u201d said the archive\u2019s acquiring curator, Julie Golia, as a waiter offered a tray of eggplant Parmesan snacks. \u201cShe was precise about how each recipe should be delivered.

Also I read through a lot of stuff (not on this list) I could not could not could not stand and nobody to blame but myself.\u201d",
      "Soon, the guests sat at banquet tables, where they were served a kale salad inspired by one of Ms. Didion\u2019s own preparations. From a stage, the actress Candice Bergen and her daughter, the Vogue writer Chloe Malle, read letters that Ms. Didion wrote to her parents after moving to New York from California in the 1950s.",

      "Many of those present had known Ms. Didion personally, but seemingly all of them listened with fascination: The letters revealed Ms. Didion when she was just another struggling writer, long before her authorial persona had become at least as famous as her work.",

All those girls in the subway carrying Joan Didion books, now they\u2019ll have a place to go find out.\u201d",

      " and self-mythologizing odes to #founder culture.",
      "An angry post by the olive oil entrepreneur Andrew Benin caused a stir in a small corner of the internet food world, in part because it raised a slippery question: Who owns the squeeze bottle?",
      "Mr. Benin is the chief executive and co-founder of ",
      ", a direct-to-consumer start-up ",
      " that sells olive oil in squeezable, forest-green plastic bottles designed for optimal drizzling and Instagramming. Whole Foods sells it, ",

      "\u201cWhile friendly competition was always welcome, I do view this as a blatant disrespect and am choosing to voice my discontent,\u201d Mr. Benin wrote. He tagged the company, ",
      ", and its founder, Aishwarya Iyer, and included a photo of the squeeze bottle in question. \u201c#Founders know that this day will come,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s ok to get miffed when folks rip you off.\u201d",

      "Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and global editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, has been the maestro of every Met Gala since 1999. But this time, it\u2019s personal.",
      "Not just because the ",
      " is devoted to the work of the much celebrated designer Karl Lagerfeld, who ",
      ", but because Mr. Lagerfeld was one of Ms. Wintour\u2019s closest friends for decades. He created the clothes that, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve worn to the most important events in my life \u2014 to my wedding, to my children\u2019s weddings, to Met Galas and state dinners and tennis championships at which I watched my heroes compete for their dreams.\u201d",
      "For her, she said, Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s designs were \u201ca uniform, a kind of armor and a way of holding certain moods and memories close. His fashion does for me what fashion should. It makes me feel more confident in being myself.\u201d",
      "Now, when she wears his work, she said, \u201cI still feel that I have him near.\u201d The Times asked Ms. Wintour to pick some of the favorite Lagerfeld designs that still hang in her closet and describe the memories they evoke.",
      "I wore this ",
      " to the amfAR gala in New York alongside Hillary Clinton when she was in the middle of her first term as senator in 2003. I wanted to feel both chic and confident. I was delighted when, some years later, my daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, wore the same dress to her first Met Gala. Karl, who liked to strike a pose against nostalgia, took one look at her and said, \u201cRecycled!\u201d In fact, Karl\u2019s dresses are enthusiastically recycled in my family, treated with reverence \u2014 but not too much. My daughter, Bee, is planning on wearing this dress to a Met after-party this year.",
      "Honestly, I don\u2019t remember when or where I first met Karl, or what I was wearing. I was probably nervous, because I was always nervous meeting people in the early years of my career. What\u2019s certain is that he quickly put me at ease. He loved meeting people, and he\u00a0loved to talk. We were both masters of compartmentalization \u2014 we kept our working lives quite separate from our friendship \u2014 and when we met socially, fashion was never our subject.",
      "Karl was interested in so much else and seemed eager to escape the snow globe of his public life. In public, he embraced his image as the high priest of chic and surfaces and whatever was absolutely new. In private \u2014 a side he guarded far more carefully \u2014 he was different.",
      "I first wore this ",
      ", inspired by the colored paints and pencils that Karl always kept scattered across his desk, to a fantastically over-the-top\u00a0Chanel\u00a0extravaganza\u00a0that he arranged in Dallas a decade ago, one of the first such runway productions in unlikely locations. (This \u201ctraveling\u201d model for fashion shows, breaking away from the staid runways in Paris or Milan, was enormously influential because Karl did it. Other houses soon followed.) This event was complete with a drive-in movie theater, a bucking-bronco ride and a rodeo.",
      "Since then, that paint box dress has been to many tamer parties in our family, including my son Charlie\u2019s wedding. Bee has also worn it to possibly too many of the weddings of her friends.",
      "Karl\u2019s dresses don\u2019t seem to age or date to a specific era. They stay with us as we cross time and live our different lives. This ",
      ", a homage to Coco Chanel\u2019s love of jewelry, was part of Karl\u2019s first Chanel couture collection in 1983. It had been in my closet for a good long time before I found the perfect occasion to wear it at President Biden\u2019s state dinner for Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Over the years, Karl designed some dresses specially for me, but we never talked about what these should be. It was more like osmosis. We\u2019d exchange a few words or a text or two about an occasion, and from these\u00a0Karl was\u00a0able to draw what would be just right \u2014 for the event but also for me. He absorbed a lot more from people than he showed.",
      "However broad his own interests, he always seemed to have room for other people\u2019s, and over the years he sent me vintage prints in honor of my love of tennis and porcelain. Karl didn\u2019t play tennis, and he didn\u2019t care for porcelain the way I did, but it was his quiet way of being attuned to other people\u2019s minds.",
      "Karl was always sending me sketches that he could create in an instant but might just as quickly ball up and toss away. One of them shows us on the dance floor, a memento of the ways we used to spend our time together in Paris. In the early days of our friendship we would meet at the Caf\u00e9 de Flore, where Karl was a habitu\u00e9. Later, he\u2019d take me to chaotically planned, totally glamorous dinners at his house, and those incredible nights often ended with dancing.",
      "Karl was a great dancer, and a greater night owl. As we got older and wiser and outwardly more respectable, we gave up the late nights and the Caf\u00e9 de Flore, and I persuaded him to meet me for dinner at my hotel (Karl was perpetually, sometimes preposterously, late, and this way I found I could get some work done while I waited for him to show up). But ",
      ", both ethereal and down to earth, is a reminder of that era of late-night dancing.",
      "When one of his late parties ended, he would go home and, alone, read Hegel and sketch deep into the night. He sent me books constantly, in volume \u2014 strange, unexpected books of the kind known only to people who spend time prowling the backs of shops.",
      "Once I was supposed to fly across the Atlantic to present him with an award in London. I\u2019m not wonderful at adjusting to time differences, and I don\u2019t particularly like public speaking. I am always early \u2014 in this case arriving two days in advance \u2014 and on the day of the event, a few hours before it began, I got a vaguely alarming text: Karl was just taking off from Paris. A couple of hours later, another one: Karl had landed and was in the car, but had stopped off at a bookshop.",
      "About an hour before the presentation, there was a third: Karl is on his way but wanted to visit a gallery. Finally, within seconds of our curtain call, Karl burst into the wings with an entourage of 15 and his usual surprised \u201cAm I late?\u201d We were swept onstage.",
      "Karl\u2019s Chanel suits put me in mind of his dogged, unexpected strength. They are uniform and armor, a testament to slow and controlled change, but there\u2019s something vividly human in them, too. When we went together to the 2014 opening of the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris, Karl told me that ",
      " was his favorite on me of any piece I\u2019d worn. Since then, I\u2019ve worn it many times. It\u2019s Karl at his finest: the classic profile made new, the sparkle and simplicity, the way it puts forward an idea of strength in femininity.",
      "Karl frequently surprised the world as a designer (he loved to turn heads), but it was as a friend that he surprised me most. Many years ago, when I was facing my first summer vacation with my children after my divorce, I was frozen. I wanted to show them a good time, but I felt in pieces. It was Karl, of all people, who sensed this and swooped in to lend a hand.",
      "He had a vacation house in Europe, by the beach, he told us, and we should spend some time there. When we arrived, to my surprise, he\u2019d planned a whole summer camp\u2019s worth of activities for my young children \u2014 surfing lessons on the beach, day trips to the nearby art museum, dancing after dinner in the evenings. Karl was perhaps even less a kid person than he was a porcelain person, but he went all out when I most needed it. That isn\u2019t something you forget. A real relationship with Karl was an association and connection built incrementally, over years.",
      "Karl could be serious, but I\u2019ll remember his tremendous sense of fun. In the early 1990s he designed a lot of ",
      ". We photographed a spread of them in Vogue, and I kept wondering whether the skirts were short enough. Whether in consideration of this question, or simply as a way of teasing me, he sent me a short skirt suit of my own. I wore a lot of short skirts at the time, but none more happily than his.",
      "Or there was the benefit Chanel staged in the meatpacking district in 1991, when the uptown crowd descended to West 12th Street in an endless array of buckled leather and ruffled tulle, all of it Chanel. I remember a journalist asking him if he had ever seen so many middle-aged women in biker jackets and miniskirts. Karl\u2019s reply was quintessential Karl, generous and coolly deadpan: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned there are no middle-aged women.\u201d",
      "I never wholly figured out his contradictions. He was someone who could be rigorous in his diet, which was notoriously stringent and health-minded, and then consume a tsunami of Diet Coke. He had his love of books and magazines and printed matter but also needed the very latest technology and devices at his fingertips. He was always looking ahead to the next thing, to the future \u2014 with a fear, I always felt, of falling behind, of being caught out.",
      "He would have been alarmed to find himself the subject of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But \u201cA Line of Beauty\u201d is an appreciation and embodiment of his genius. Since 2005, I have worn his dresses to almost every opening gala for the Costume Institute that I have co-hosted. This ",
      " which I wore to the \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass\u201d show in 2015, was an example of Karl\u2019s dexterity and quick wits at his desk. On the runway, it was short, but, with a sweep of his pencil, it became ankle-length \u2014 and it worked beautifully that way.",
      "Our friendship meant everything to me, and I miss him deeply. I am grateful for all the moments, such as this one, that can bring his work to life and, in the process, keep him near."

      "Through talent, longevity and sheer productivity, it is possible that Karl Lagerfeld did more than any other designer to shape the look of the latter 20th century and the early 21st century. Across more than six decades, five different brands (three at the same time) and numerous collaborations, he flooded the zone from Paris to Dallas to Shanghai, dressing Hollywood, the haute and the high street.",
      "But why tell when we can show? Here are some of the most notable looks from nearly every stage of an extraordinary career.",
      "1958-1963",
      "In 1954, Mr. Lagerfeld, a young German with no formal fashion training, ",
      " in the prestigious Woolmark Prize \u2014 a serendipitous event that led to a job as an assistant to the couturier Pierre Balmain, who was one of the judges. After only three years in that atelier, while still in his 20s, Mr. Lagerfeld was named artistic director of Jean Patou, a brand founded in 1914, whose founder was known for liberating the female form and for creating the perfume Joy.",
      "There, Mr. Lagerfeld went on to create 10 couture collections over five years, laying the groundwork for his own facility in working with petites mains, and his ability to romp gleefully within the confines of an established aesthetic.",
      "Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images",
      "A Patou dress from 1960 by Karl Lagerfeld. He was criticized that year for showing the shortest skirts of the season in Paris \u2014 a first sign that he was happy to thumb his nose at the establishment.",
      "1964-1997",
      "In 1966, Mr. Lagerfeld became designer of Chlo\u00e9, one of the earliest ready-to-wear brands in Paris, working first with its founder, Gaby Aghion (who initially brought him on as a freelancer in 1964), before becoming sole designer in 1974. He would remain at the brand until 1983, returning again from 1992 to 1997.",
      "Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s early work at Chlo\u00e9, a name that became synonymous with a certain wafty femininity, may surprise many, toying as it did with prints and Surrealism. But it also reflected his ability to balance luxe eccentricity and wearability, with an eye to commerce (he never saw \u201csales\u201d as a dirty word). By his second stint, he had fully embraced the bohemian, and set the tone for what was to come.",
      "via Chlo\u00e9",
      "The \u201ctertulia\u201d dress from Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s first season, in 1966, when he was still working with Ms. Aghion.",
      "A sheer black dress from Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s first solo collection for Chlo\u00e9, featuring both the flou and Surrealist touches that would mark his tenure.",
      "A spring 1982 \u201ctrellis\u201d dress featuring boho geometry and a corset waist was inspired in part by the artist Sonia Delaunay.",
      "For his fall 1983 collection, Mr. Lagerfeld elevated plumbing to the status of high decoration.",
      "A \u201cviolin\u201d dress, originally shown on the runway in spring 1983, which looked just as relevant when it was reissued in 2013 and worn by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.",
      "Pat Cleveland, dancing down the runway for spring 1984, in the kind of springy dress that became a Chlo\u00e9 staple.",
      "Boho romance took shape in spring 1996, via lace and an exaggerated straw hat.",
      "1965-2019",
      "In 1965, the five Fendi sisters, who had inherited their family fur business from their parents, Adele and Edoardo, brought Mr. Lagerfeld on to design their ready-to-wear and fur collections.",
      "They may have thought they were getting a clever designer, but what they actually got was a lifetime partnership. Silvia Venturini Fendi, the daughter of Anna Fendi, who grew up to design Fendi bags and men\u2019s wear alongside Mr. Lagerfeld, recalled that even as a child, \u201cwhen Karl came,\u201d it was clear \u201csomething special was going on and I should pay attention.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lagerfeld created the \u201cFF\u201d logo, which stood for the concept of \u201cfun fur\u201d (as well as Fendi), and then started shaving, dyeing, sculpting and otherwise transforming the material, as well as introducing such pelts as mole, rabbit and squirrel to high fashion.",
      "His work on the runway was equally experimental, with a wide array of references, including Fendi\u2019s Roman roots and futurism. When LVMH bought the brand in 1999, Mr. Lagerfeld went with it, eventually pioneering a \u201chaute fourrure\u201d line (who had even heard of that before?) to go with the ready-to-wear, remaining defiantly pro-fur even as the public mood shifted and other brands turned against the idea of wearing animal skins.",
      "Michel Maurou/WWD, via Getty Images",
      "Mr. Lagerfeld upended the traditional practice of putting fur on a pedestal, manipulating, tufting and bobbling pelts as if they were any other fabric. This fall 1981 poncho is a case in point.",
      "In 2007, Fendi became the first brand to hold a fashion show on the Great Wall of China, announcing its ambitions for global growth and notching an early victory in a game of venue one-upmanship that continues to this day.",
      "In 2016, Mr. Lagerfeld brought his second haute fourrure show to the Trevi Fountain in Rome for Fendi\u2019s 90th anniversary. Models appeared to walk on water, many in dresses featuring minute fur appliqu\u00e9s, like mosaics, done with eye-popping skill.",
      "In 2014, Mr. Lagerfeld unveiled \u201cBag Boy Karlito,\u201d a limited-edition bag charm made in his image from mink, fox and goat. A month after the waiting list for the charm opened, there were 600 names signed up \u2014 even though the toys cost $1,685 each.",
      "1982-2019",
      "In 1982, Mr. Lagerfeld got the job that would vault him into the fashion stratosphere: artistic director of Chanel, at that point a brand known primarily for perfume and bourgeois handbags. By adopting an approach he summed up in highly questionable terms (\u201cChanel is an institution, and you have to treat an institution like a whore \u2014 and then you get something out of her\u201d), he revived a moribund brand, providing a template for the industry that is still in place today.",
      "Splicing classic Chanel iconography \u2014 the camellia, pearls, the Maltese cross, boucl\u00e9 suiting \u2014 with a heavy dose of irony and irreverence, he managed to make the brand a pop culture phenomenon, a symbol of classicism and a financial juggernaut. He helped create and popularize the traveling fashion show, bringing his runway to Salzburg, Edinburgh, Shanghai and Havana; dreamed up such ",
      " as an iceberg (",
      "), a supermarket and a rocket ship (that actually lifted off); made mini-movies with ",
      " and ",
      "; and ultimately helped bring the brand annual sales topping $11 billion.",
      "Chanel",
      "A trompe l\u2019oeil dress with faux necklaces and belts from Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s first Chanel couture collection, paying homage to Coco\u2019s penchant for draping herself in ropes of pearls and gold chains. Decades later, Anna Wintour would wear the same dress to a Biden state dinner.",
      "In\u00e8s de la Fressange and Jerry Hall modeling Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s Chanel version of power shoulders and Reagan red suiting in a 1986 couture show.",
      "Easter egg alert: Claudia Schiffer in a 1990 ready-to-wear gown featuring costume jewelry versions of the Maltese cross on Verdura cuffs that were Coco\u2019s signature \u2014 just as embedding such Chanel references in his collections was one of Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s signatures.",
      "The 1994 spring collection featured the classic Chanel boucl\u00e9 suits \u2014 with ultra-mini skirts in Jordan almond shades, an example of Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s willingness to blow raspberries at established brand codes the better to recast them as cool.",
      "Stella Tennant in a micro-mini double-C logo bikini in 1996. Mr. Lagerfeld made a sport (to so speak) out of putting haute branding on leisure gear, from skis to motorcycle helmets and even boxing gloves.",
      "Devon Aoki in the Y2K version of couture in 1999: crop top and hipster taffeta ball skirt.",
      "A look from a 2009 Chanel couture show. Coming out of the Great Recession, Mr. Lagerfeld took paper flowers as his inspiration, and the theme was reflected in the clothes.",
      "In the 2010s, the Chanel ready-to-wear shows and sets became increasingly extravagant. The 2015 spring collection, for example, was set in a faux Parisian boulevard complete with a protest march for a finale.",
      "In 2016, Mr. Lagerfeld dedicated his spring couture show to sustainability, crafting garments from mosaics of wood and, as in this look, mother-of-pearl \u2014 another example of his ability to find beauty in pretty much any material.",
      "In 1997, Chanel created its Paraffection subsidiary, a group of ateliers that specialized in embroidery, millinery, buttons and other hand-worked decoration; in 2002, Mr. Lagerfeld created the annual M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art show to highlight their work. In 2018, Pharrell Williams walked the runway for one of Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s last M\u00e9tiers collections, held in the Temple of Dendur at the Met.",
      "Kaia Gerber in Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s last couture show, inspired by the 18th century but also thoroughly modern.",
      "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, a Chanel face and muse for Mr. Lagerfeld, walked in the March 2019 show that paid homage to the designer just after his death.",
      "1984-2019",
      "Perhaps tired of working within the style vernaculars established by others, in 1984, Mr. Lagerfeld founded his own namesake line. While it would never reach the size or fame of Chanel or Fendi, and though it went through numerous ownership changes, Lagerfeld the brand reflected his personal style more closely than any of his other brands. Imagine rock \u2019n\u2019 roll tailoring with a Teutonic edge, filtered through a monochromatic lens, and you\u2019ll get the idea.",
      "FirstVIEW",
      "Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s signature uniform after he lost 92 pounds in 2001 was a tight pair of black jeans, a crisp white button-up and a tailored jacket. If it worked for him, why not everyone else?",
      "Bejeweled motorcycle helmets on the Lagerfeld fall 2009 runway came complete with little iPod pockets, a nod to Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s love of technology. (At one time, he was said to own 300 iPods himself.)",
      "2004",
      "In 2004, Mr. Lagerfeld became the first couture designer to collaborate with a mass-market brand when he signed on to do an H&M collection. First the fashion world was shocked, then it was intrigued, and after the line of Karl-alike black suits, portrait tees and L.B.D.s sold out in seconds, a whole new genre and approach was born.",
      "Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images",
      "Dress like Karl: A sequined black blazer and a T-shirt bearing Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s image were part of his limited edition collection for H&M.",
      "Anna Grace Lee",

      "Dawn Davis, a veteran book editor who was hired in 2020 to put ",
      " magazine back on track after ",
      " at its parent company, ",
      ", resigned on Tuesday. She will return to Simon & Schuster as the publisher of ",
      ", an imprint she founded in 2013, and as executive editor of the Simon & Schuster trade imprint.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made the difficult decision to return to book publishing,\u201d Ms. Davis wrote in a note to her staff at Bon App\u00e9tit and ",
      ", the company\u2019s recipe website. She said that she would remain in the job until September, and cited successes like \u201chelping build Bon App\u00e9tit and Epicurious\u2019 authority in the culinary industry, developing delicious and thought-provoking content, growing our audiences across channels, and diversifying our team and the audiences that we reach.\u201d",
      "But, she said in a public statement, \u201cbeing away from books has only made me realize how much I love working on manuscripts.\u201d She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In her first editor\u2019s letter at Bon App\u00e9tit, in February 2021, Ms. Davis wrote that \u201cwhen the call came to leave book publishing to take the helm at this storied magazine as it reckoned with racial and cultural equity, it was impossible to resist.\u201d",
      "She joined at a time of enormous upheaval at Bon App\u00e9tit, which became Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s leading food title after ",
      " in 2009. Although Ms. Davis\u2019s editorial focus wasn\u2019t on food and she hadn\u2019t edited at a magazine, Anna Wintour, then Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s artistic director and the chairwoman of its diversity and inclusion council, persuaded her to take the job.",
      "Ms. Davis\u2019s predecessor, Adam Rapoport, was a Cond\u00e9 Nast insider, having worked at GQ before becoming chief of Bon App\u00e9tit in 2010.",
      " in June 2020, after a 2004 photo that showed him wearing an offensive costume was posted online by the food writer ",
      ". But Bon App\u00e9tit staff members were already speaking out about longtime racial inequities in pay and career advancement. Ultimately, more than two dozen people, including stars of the magazine\u2019s popular YouTube channel, left the magazine in protest.",
      "When Ms. Davis returns to Simon & Schuster in September, she will be a member of the executive leadership team, and will report directly to the company\u2019s chief executive, Jonathan Karp.",
      "Ms. Davis first joined Simon & Schuster in 2013. Books she published there include \u201cNever Caught\u201d by Erica Armstrong Dunbar, which was a finalist for the National Book Award; \u201cTough Love\u201d by Susan Rice; and best-selling titles by the comedian Kevin Hart and the weight-loss expert JJ Smith. Before joining Simon & Schuster, Ms. Davis was the publisher of Amistad, an imprint of HarperCollins, where she edited \u201cThe Known World\u201d by Edward P. Jones, which won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.",
      "She will rejoin Simon & Schuster at an unusual moment for the company. Penguin Random House, the biggest publisher in the United States, tried to buy Simon & Schuster for $2.175 billion, but last year a federal judge ",
      " on antitrust grounds. Simon & Schuster\u2019s parent company, Paramount Global, has said it still intends to sell the publisher.",
      "Despite the uncertainty of a future sale, Simon & Schuster has posted tremendous results in the past year, even as other publishers have struggled with weaker earnings. It brought in $1.1 billion in revenue in 2022, the first time in its history the company hit more than $1 billion. Its operating income for the year, of $248 million, was also a record. The company said there was growth across the business, but some of its standout authors included Colleen Hoover, Taylor Jenkins Reid, Jennette McCurdy and Stephen King."

      " (above), he swaps out the chicken for roasted, charred cauliflower, creating a meatless classic brimming with texture: crunchy toasted walnuts, crisp chunks of apples and sweet, chewy raisins.

      "Now, directly below the 103rd Street-Corona Plaza station, you can find tripa mishqui from Ecuador, guisado from Guatemala and tlayudas from Oaxaca, Mexico.",
      "All these are among the riches at a sprawling market filled with as many as 46 vendors selling home-style food from across Latin America \u2014 the kind you won\u2019t easily find in restaurants.",
      "Aromas of just-fried poblanos and fresh masa waft up toward the train platform. Down on the plaza, vendors call out: \u201cCarnitas!\u201d \u201cEsquites!\u201d \u201cTortas!\u201d Tortillas are embellished with shavings of beef and diced onions. Shrimp flecked with cilantro and garlic sizzle on a flattop. Pork skin crackles as lechon is sliced and laid over warm potatoes.",
      " isn\u2019t just an exciting place to eat; it\u2019s a significant achievement for the street vendors, most of whom live in the neighborhood. Last summer, they formally established ",
      ", La Asociaci\u00f3n de Vendedores Ambulantes de Corona Plaza, to run the market \u2014 making this one of the only markets in New York spearheaded and operated by local vendors. (Many of the city\u2019s markets are run by third-party groups that bring in vendors from outside the neighborhood.)",
      "Street vendors in New York face a host of challenges, from hauling their wares to dealing with the police. Even here, their livelihoods are precarious. Most of the Corona Plaza vendors don\u2019t have the permits the city requires, and many have been ticketed or told to leave by the police. They hope the association they created can build a better relationship with the authorities.",
      "\u201cIf we organize, we can work with the city, and they can see that we are important,\u201d said Mary Carmen Sevilla, an owner of a taco stall and the association\u2019s secretary. \u201cWe can lift up our voices.\u201d",
      "On an unseasonably chilly Monday evening in April, the market was bustling. Children nibbled on churros emanating steam, their lips coated with cinnamon sugar. Adults strolled around balancing tortas overflowing with toppings, or gathered at tables to dig into bowls of salchipapas \u2014 a playful South American street food of French fries and sausages doused in a spicy salsa.",
      "Ms. Sevilla stood outside her stall, Tacos Los Dos Compas, and greeted everyone who passed by. She runs the business with her husband, Miguel Angel Padilla, and her brother, Jairo Sevilla; they immigrated from Puebla, Mexico, at different times over the last two decades.",
      "Their tacos are made to the family\u2019s exacting standards. The trio and a few workers roll out the masa and cook the tortillas fresh for each order. For one of their most popular tacos, carnitas, they marinate the pork in citrus and warm spices for several hours, then gently sear it on the plancha. Other tacos get a coating of cheese that melts and crisps around the edges of the tortilla as it cooks. Mr. Padilla garnishes each taco himself with shingled white onions and cabbage, then advises diners on which of the salsas pairs best.",
      "Like many of the vendors, Ms. Sevilla and Mr. Padilla started the stall after losing their jobs during the early months of the\u00a0pandemic\u00a0in 2020. Ms. Sevilla made wigs for cancer patients, and Mr. Padilla cooked at an Italian restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. Whenever he prepared Mexican food for the restaurant staff, it was a hit. \u201cThey said, \u2018This is well-seasoned, why don\u2019t you sell your own food?\u2019 \u201d his wife said in Spanish.",
      "The couple wanted customers to be able to sit and eat, so they set up a makeshift counter out front with a checkered tablecloth and stools. They know many of their regulars by name.",
      "\u201cThe owners are friendly and respectful, and the food is flavorful,\u201d said Javier Goes, a pastry chef for a Manhattan hotel who lives nearby and frequents Tacos Los Dos Compas. \u201cIt is familiar food. I am from Puebla.\u201d",
      "Corona Plaza wasn\u2019t always this busy. The plaza was first carved out as a public space in 2012. It expanded in 2018 when the city Department of Transportation invested $7 million to remove asphalt and create a pedestrian zone that began to attract a smattering of vendors.",
      "Their ranks exploded\u00a0during the pandemic, when many Corona residents lost their jobs\u00a0and couldn\u2019t apply for unemployment\u00a0benefits because they were undocumented.\u00a0At one point, Corona recorded the ",
      " of any neighborhood in the city.",
      "\u201cI stayed here without work, without anything,\u201d said Froilan Garcia, who had helped his sister, Cristina Garcia, with her tamale stand. \u201cWe were fighting to survive.\u201d\u00a0Once the lockdown ended, he set up his own stall.",
      "In the evening light, Mr.\u00a0Garcia stood grinning in front of colorful drink dispensers filled with all manner of hot and cold beverages.",
      "\u201cNobody sells drinks like these here,\u201d he said. His aguas frescas have distinctive flavors like cucumber, lemon and chia seed, and he uses only fresh produce and spring water. His atoles \u2014 a smooth, creamy Mexican beverage thickened with corn flour \u2014 are infused with ingredients like walnuts or peanuts, giving them a toasty depth. On a good day, he said, he\u2019ll make $500.",
      "A self-described extrovert, he said his favorite part of being a vendor is interacting with customers. \u201cEveryone comes and visits me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople come from Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Chicago.\u201d",
      "He waved to his sister, who, a few stalls down, was stuffing a chile poblano oozing with molten cheese into a tortilla lined with rice, her sweatshirt hood up to keep warm. For her, vending is simply a matter of necessity: \u201cI support my grandchildren. I have kids.\u201d",
      "A small group of customers huddled around the flattop at Quesadillas Lola, which specializes in the food of Axochiapan, in the Mexican state of Morelos. A favorite is\u00a0the quesadilla filled with stringy cheese and squash blossoms.",
      "Gabriela Ramirez, a house cleaner who was picking up food, said she appreciated the affordability of the stalls. \u201cIt is cheaper than what I find in restaurants,\u201d she said.",
      "But that discrepancy has frustrated many restaurateurs in the surrounding streets. Rosaura Coello, an owner of ",
      ", an Ecuadorean cafe just off\u00a0the plaza, said her business has suffered because she can\u2019t compete with the lower prices. The restaurant\u2019s calentado, a traditional breakfast dish with rice, beans, chorizo and eggs, costs $14; at Corona Plaza, entrees of the same size can be found for under $10.",
      "Diners \u201cdon\u2019t realize all the costs that I have that vendors don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Coello said. \u201cThere is a difference in quality and flavor. They are not the same.\u201d",
      "Yet these street vendors face obstacles that restaurant owners don\u2019t, starting with the permits that most of them lack.",
      "Mr. Padilla and Ms. Sevilla of Tacos Los Dos Compas said they had been ticketed\u00a0by police officers, who once\u00a0ordered them to leave the plaza. When the police confiscated Ms. Garcia\u2019s equipment and food, she had to retrieve her belongings and buy new ingredients. The vendors said enforcement of the law has been uneven, and they fear their stalls could be shut down at any time.",
      "In a city with an estimated 20,000 street vendors, the waiting list for a permit is at least 10 to 15 years long, said Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez, the deputy director of the ",
      ", a nonprofit that aids and lobbies for vendors.",
      "A bewildering number of city agencies have held enforcement power over street vendors in recent years, including the Police Department, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection and most recently the Department of Sanitation.",
      "At least one agency, the Department of Transportation, sees value in Corona Plaza. The department\u2019s commissioner, Ydanis Rodr\u00edguez, said the food it sells \u201cis important for the culture and the city of New York.\u201d",
      "The department is working with Corona Plaza vendors\u2019 association to bring in a market operator to manage the vendors in the plaza, so they wouldn\u2019t need a permit for mobile food vending. The city also recently installed large trash bins in the plaza for commercial waste.",
      "The vendors said they were optimistic that these shifts would attract more visitors, especially with warmer weather on the way. \u201cOther people from other nationalities can come and learn about our culture,\u201d Mr. Padilla said.",
      "Catalina Cruz, who represents the area in the State Assembly, wants visitors, too. But what she doesn\u2019t want, she said, \u201cis for this to become the sort of gentrifiers\u2019 haven where we could lose the sense of community.\u201d",
      "She sees Corona Plaza as a different kind of haven \u2014 a variation on a beloved thoroughfare of Italian food in the Bronx: \u201cArthur Avenue,\u201d she said, \u201cexcept with pupusas and chicharr\u00f3n.\u201d"

      "The first time I tasted changua, a dairy-rich Colombian soup, my wife, Adri, a Bogotana from the heart of changua country, grimaced as I swirled the golden yolk of a poached egg through some half-melted cheese. She pulled a sour face as I sopped up the milky broth, seasoned with cilantro and green onions, with a chunk of bread. She pretended, I think, to suppress a gag as I ate it and continued until I finished.",
      "Changua, an Andean soup of Muisca origin, has a divided audience in its home departments of Cundinamarca and Boyac\u00e1. (An informal poll I took in the group chat I share with my Colombian in-laws showed a near-perfect split between changua lovers and haters, as did a poll I took on Instagram.)",
      "I can understand why. The idea of warm onion milk with stale bread, cheese and half-curdled eggs stirred into it is, admittedly, not particularly appetizing.",
      "But as a changua lover, it comforts me in the same way other, more well-known broth-soaked stale bread recipes born of frugality do: ",
      ", Italian ",
      " or even ",
      " with a handful of crackers. The difference is that changua is so fast and simple that it\u2019s doable on a bleary-eyed weekday morning. Add some stretchy cheese and a runny egg yolk, and it starts to sound pretty good, doesn\u2019t it?",
      "My knowledge of how to make changua, like most of my Colombian recipe knowledge, begins with my Adri\u2019s aunt Gloria, who taught me how to make it in her tiny kitchen in Subachoque.",
      "She started by combining equal parts milk and water (\u201cnever stock,\u201d she scolded) with sliced Colombian long onions, minced cilantro and salt. Then, she pulled out some stale supermarket-style baguettes, which we opted for over almoj\u00e1banas, a corn flour and cheese bread. We tore them into chunks and dropped them into the pot.",
      "Next, we cracked a couple of eggs into a bowl before tipping them into the simmering pot, then divided the soup into warm bowls, an egg in each, and topped them with bits of queso pera, a good-melting, pear-shaped cheese that resembles full-fat low-moisture mozzarella. It was a perfect breakfast, eaten with cups of frothy hot chocolate (which, in the Colombian style, also got a few cubes of cheese stirred into them).",
      "Since then, I\u2019ve looked into recipes in books and on the internet, and found most to be virtually identical. Some suggest placing the stale bread in the serving bowl and pouring the hot broth on top, others serving bread on the side for dipping. Occasionally, a recipe will suggest saut\u00e9ing the onions before adding the milk, but I prefer the lighter flavor of just-simmered onions. Some recipes even suggest using broth. (I sometimes season mine with a bouillon cube instead of salt \u2014 don\u2019t tell Gloria.) Potatoes are a common addition.",
      "The only real difficulty is in finding the right onions and cilantro. The long onions used in the Colombian Andes resemble a large green onion or a small leek, but I\u2019ve made this soup with Japanese negi, spring onions, ramps from the farmers\u2019 market and supermarket scallions. While they produce different soups, each one is delicious. Use whatever you have on hand.",
      "In Colombia, cilantro is typically sold after the plant has bolted (prepared to produce flowers and seeds) and a dense growth of feathery leaves \u2014 more intensely flavored than the ones in American supermarkets \u2014 pop up. If you grow your own cilantro and diligently prune it to prevent bolting, try letting it go, so you can harvest the more intense leaves. If not, don\u2019t worry: Regular cilantro leaves also work just fine here.",
      "I was in Boyac\u00e1 with my family this past winter and had just finished shooting ",
      " for my YouTube channel. I jokingly asked Adri if she wanted some. Turns out, she has opened up a bit to the idea: She would eat it if served but never choose to make or order it. As the one who usually makes breakfast, I\u2019ll test the veracity of her claim the next time one of my frequent urges for changua arises."

      " last July, and on Wednesday it was nominated for a ",
      " in the category of U.S. Foodways.",

      ", a collection of small coastal communities from North Carolina to North Florida. Mrs. Meggett\u2019s family and other enslaved people held onto some of their traditions and adopted new ones, forging a culture known as Gullah Geechee and a ",
      ".",
      "Mrs. Meggett grew up in the Jim Crow South and began her career cooking for white families who kept homes on Edisto, following a tradition with a fraught and complicated history.",
      "\u201cMany Black women,\u201d she wrote in the book, \u201cpaved the way for cooks like me to find a career that could support my family and give me the chance to do something I\u2019m good at.\u201d",
      "As Lavern Meggett put it, \u201cShe endured it and she made it.\u201d",
      "Her cookbook included 123 recipes created over a lifetime of cooking for her own large family, her church and the families she worked for.",
      "The book, true to Gullah Geechee cuisine, focused on rice, seafood and fresh local vegetables. But it also featured one-pot African recipes like chicken perloo and okra soup. Other dishes, like pot roast, stuffed bell peppers and broccoli with cheese sauce, she acquired while cooking for white families.",
      "Mrs. Meggett learned to cook from her maternal grandmother, Rosa Major Doctor, who raised her. Recipes were handed down orally without the guidance of measurements or written instructions. For two months while she worked on the book, Ms. Stewart learned to cook that way under Mrs. Meggett\u2019s guidance, making complex dishes like a stuffed shad, which they deboned, filled with parsley rice and sewed shut, a two-day project.",
      "But it took years for the book to come to fruition. It started in 1994, when Mrs. Meggett began cooking for the family of Becky Smith, who summered on Edisto Beach. Mrs. Smith repeatedly encouraged Mrs. Meggett to write a book, and the two developed a close friendship. Mrs. Smith pulled out measuring cups and spoons to record the amount of ingredients that Mrs. Meggett used as she cooked, and she recorded her stories.",
      "\u201cI never wanted to forget the things she told me because she changed me,\u201d Mrs. Smith said in a phone interview.",
      "Mrs. Meggett always gave to people in need and had strong religious faith. She drove around with a pot of food in her car and asked God to lead her to people who needed help, Mrs. Smith recalled.",
      "Everyone knew that if her kitchen door was open, anyone could stop by for food \u2014 including a couple of tourists who, after reading Mrs. Meggett\u2019s cookbook, drove to Edisto from Texas last year. Mrs. Meggett served them shrimp and grits.",
      "Mrs. Meggett and Mrs. Smith worked on the cookbook together over the years. During the pandemic, Mrs. Smith\u2019s son Elliot edited the manuscript. He asked BJ Dennis, a Gullah chef in Charleston, for his feedback. A few weeks before the Smiths and Mrs. Meggett were going to publish the book themselves, a literary agent asked Mr. Dennis if he was interested in writing a book. He suggested that the first book on Gullah Geechee cuisine should be Mrs. Meggett\u2019s.",
      "At first, Mrs. Meggett didn\u2019t like the idea because it would take much longer to publish.",
      "\u201cI thought I would be dead and gone because of Covid by 2022,\u201d ",
      " in an interview last year. \u201cBut I prayed about it, and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her life story was woven throughout the cookbook, published by ",
      ". Her parents, Laura V. Hutchinson and Isaiah Fludd, were sharecroppers.",
      "In 1951, she married Jessie Meggett, who maintained roads and worked at a grocery store. He liked grits for breakfast and rice with dinner, but the toppings always varied, Lavern Meggett said.",
      "The couple had 10 children.",
      "In addition to her daughter Lavern, Mrs. Meggett is survived by seven other children, Christopher Hutchinson, Mildred Heyward, Elizann Mack, Louise Meggett, Carolyn Goodwin, Elizabeth Jones and Marvette Meggett; a stepson, Ronald Bailey; her brother, Cornelius Thrower; and more than 65 grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren. Mr. Meggett died in 2006.",

      "She also taught her children and some of her grandchildren to cook dishes, like red rice and shrimp and gravy with grits, just as she did \u2014 by feel, and not with recipes. Their large family gatherings always centered on food, like the Thanksgiving turkey stuffed with cornbread dressing, which she taught Lavern to make when Lavern was 10.",

The idea for this delicate, appealing first course is to have an assortment of complementary greens, herbs and vegetables, artfully arranged on a platter or individual plates, dribbled with a tangy vinaigrette. Feel free to improvise: A few spinach leaves, a handful of raw sweet garden peas or fava beans, or thinly sliced raw artichoke can be nice additions, as can edible blossoms like nasturtium, rose or calendula.",
      "For a main, I chose cauliflower \u201csteaks,\u201d which I hadn\u2019t made ages. A large cauliflower steak was all the rage in upscale restaurants a few years ago, when cauliflower was the darling of the cooking world. It\u2019s a vegetable that, cooked correctly, is easy to love.",
      "To get thick slices, you\u2019ll need a couple of medium to large heads. Be warned that there will be trimmings, to be turned into a soup or use for stir-fry for another meal. But I never mind having too much cauliflower. If you don\u2019t want bother with slices, you can make this dish with baked florets just as easily.",
      "It\u2019s a simple dish to prepare. The steaks are painted with extra-virgin olive oil, seasoned on both sides, and then roasted, topped with cheese and bread crumbs, and placed back into the oven to get golden. If you top them with a bit of anchovy, it\u2019s not vegetarian, of course, but it\u2019s awfully good. These steaks are surprisingly substantial and filling. An option to consider is serving the baked cauliflower steaks with a light marinara sauce, but they are very tasty with no sauce at all.",
      "Here, in California, recent torrential rains have pummeled the strawberry fields and prevented the daily harvest. Thankfully, now the sun shines, and organic local strawberries are back.",
      "For dessert, I made them the centerpiece: I sliced some and lightly sugared and spooned them into glasses, topping them with ricotta cream \u2014 sweetened ultra-fresh ricotta, lightly whipped. Commonly used in Sicily to fill cannoli or frost traditional cakes, it is pretty fabulous. I layered the lovely stuff with the strawberries for a splendid parfait.",
      "Such a pleasant meal it was, a spring awakening."

      ".",
      "Created for the ",
      " of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, the posh, delicately flavored chicken has, like Britain itself, changed a bit since. What was originally an aristocratic paragon of classic French technique has been democratized into a weeknight-easy chicken salad. Though enormously popular in Britain as a sandwich filling and baked-potato topper, this ocher-tinted, raisin-studded dish would be unrecognizable to any of the 350 dignitaries who partook of its regal ancestor.",
      "The ",
      ", developed at the Cordon Bleu culinary school in London, was called \u201cpoulet Reine Elizabeth.\u201d A dish of cold poached chicken in a rose-hued sauce made from red wine, mayonnaise, whipped cream, apricot pur\u00e9e and a faint whiff of curry powder, it was served alongside a pea-studded rice salad at a coronation banquet to the queen\u2019s honored guests (but not likely to the queen herself).",
      ", a London-based food writer and author of \u201c",
      ",\u201d describes that dish as shaped by French cuisine with a nod toward colonial India, and based on the jubilee chicken created in 1935 for George V, who, like his grandmother Queen Victoria, had a penchant for curries.",
      "\u201cThe curry powder in coronation chicken was probably an acknowledgment of the influence of the empire and a tribute to the two previous curry-loving monarchs,\u201d Ms. Sukhadwala wrote in an email.",
      "Over the years, the recipe has become something more accessible to British home cooks. Out went the red wine reduction, whipped cream, homemade mayonnaise and apricot pur\u00e9e; in came jarred mayonnaise, golden raisins, sliced almonds and mango chutney, pantry staples you could quickly stir together in one bowl. And what was once a pinch of curry powder grew to several tablespoons, staining the mix a vivid \u2014 some say lurid \u2014 yellow.",
      "By the 1980s, coronation chicken salad had become ubiquitous in Britain, found in ready-made sandwiches at Marks & Spencer and on backyard bridal and baby shower menus alike.",
      "This steep ascent was fueled by what the British food writer ",
      ", author of \u201c",
      ",\u201d calls a revival of Raj nostalgia that set in with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s tenure as prime minister.",
      "Coronation chicken \u201cwants to evoke the peacocks and rubies, the grandeur and spice of regal Indian dynasties, without actually delivering any strong flavors,\u201d Mr. Loyal said.",
      "Yet he\u2019s a fan. His version, which uses a complex Punjabi masala with black and green cardamom, ajwain, fennel and tamarind, alludes to the beloved 1980s version of his childhood while celebrating Mr. Loyal\u2019s identity as a second-generation British Indian.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m un-diluting its Indianness,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, the 1980s version is delightful, and a snap to make.",
      "The key is to choose your ingredients carefully. Start with cooked chicken that already has loads of flavor, whether you\u2019re poaching it yourself or buying a rotisserie bird from the store. Find a mango chutney brand that\u2019s complex and not too sweet. Use a good, tangy mayonnaise, ideally homemade. And \u2014 if you can find it \u2014 stir in curry paste from a jar instead of curry powder, which, depending on the brand, can have a raw, acrid undertone.",
      "The result is a dish for the people that\u2019s fit for a king. Which you might be hard-pressed to say about quiche."

      "At times they look like superheroes, moving together to the rhythm of the music, conjuring tricks like magicians.",
      "I first heard of the Sea Clown Sailing Circus when I was following the stories of refugees crossing Greece. Members of the circus were performing at a camp in Athens, trying to win smiles from children who had experienced too much pain.",
      "Later, I joined the performers in the summer of 2020 on the storied island of Ithaca, in the Ionian Sea. Hoping to sail with the nomad crew, I happened to arrive the very day their engine broke down. Apparently it was a regular occurrence. A technician from the island mocked them: The engines were rusting from lack of use, he said.",
      "It was true that Fred Normal and Alvaro Ramirez, the captains, never wanted to use the engines, aiming instead to sail with the wind as much as possible \u2014 even while docking at and departing from the port.",
      "Twenty years earlier, in the United States, Fred, an Alaska-born circus performer, decided it was pointless to try to change the world while traveling with gas-guzzling trucks and caravans. Instead, he resolved to offer his form of utopia to people across the United States and Europe by bicycle. He rode around with his crew from one town to the next, staging pop-up shows and sleeping beside campfires.",
      "Eventually, on the Southern coast of Italy, he met Nikoleta Giakumeli, a Greek acrobat, and Alvaro, a Uruguayan clown who had been traveling around Europe. Together, the trio dreamed up the idea of a seaborne circus, even though none of them had ever formally sailed.",
      "So they learned. For 13 years, Fred and Nikoleta lived on their boat, Surloulou, through summers and winters. After the birth of their daughter, Sirena, who at the age of 4 is already climbing ropes and trying her first tricks as an acrobat, their lives changed dramatically. They now spend less time with the circus, which, despite their absence, continues reinventing itself with new performers and new ideas.",
      "Dozens of artists from all over the world are connected with the Sea Clown Sailing Circus. Some join the crew for only a few days; others join for the whole summer. But a core group of around seven or eight people are trying to bring the circus to a greater acclaim \u2014 not only by roaming freely from one Greek island to another, but also by producing more meaningful, and more philosophically engaging, shows.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when I joined the Sea Clowns again for a month, they were producing a new show based on Plato\u2019s ",
      ". I saw firsthand how dedicated the performers are to their craft. Though their performances often feel impromptu, the Sea Clowns are in fact immensely disciplined in their preparations. Every act \u2014 from acrobatic shows and fire juggling to aerial rope tricks and slacklining \u2014 requires a tremendous degree of skill and training. And they simply love to learn.",
      "Being a part of the crew requires being good at sailing, music or circus acts, and ideally all three. But what\u2019s most important is the ability to express enough humor, kindness and respect to live in proximity with a crew of curious artists every day without creating tensions.",
      "It\u2019s also a challenge, of course, to adapt to life on a shoestring budget. \u201cWe live or we die by the hat,\u201d Fred would say at the end of every show, inviting the public to offer a donation for the Sea Clowns\u2019 survival.",
      "The life of a street (or water) artist is fragile, delicate \u2014 like a tightrope act, or juggling with knives, or sailing through a storm. Yet for most of the crew, nothing seems to offer them a greater sense of freedom. The Sea Clowns ride with their sails open to the wind, confronting both their dreams and an unpredictable future.",

      "As spring bursts forth, wild turkeys begin the mating game. Groups congregate in lawns and fields \u2014 and sometimes in the middle of the street. Males puff out their iridescent feathers, fan their tails and drag their wings on the ground in a vie for the right to breed. Their faces and necks turn dazzling shades of blue and red.",
      "Once rare and elusive denizens of America\u2019s woodlands, these heaviest of the galliform birds (chickens and their relatives) have gone urban. Wild turkeys live in the residential neighborhoods around my home in Madison, Wis.",
      "A few years ago, their elaborate courtship displays fascinated me so much that I began to photograph them \u2014 and, as I\u2019ve learned, there\u2019s more happening than meets the eye.",
      "For starters, turkeys of a feather flock together. Males, known as toms, can form lifelong flocks with their brothers. Dr. Alan Krakauer, a ",
      " and fellow ",
      ", studied this as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He ",
      " that toms in a flock were anywhere from full to half-siblings. These bands of brothers cooperated to court females, or hens, and chase off competing males.",
      "Remarkably, though, only the dominant male mated and fathered offspring. The subordinate brothers served as \u201cwingmen,\u201d \u201cbodyguards,\u201d or \u201cbackup dancers,\u201d to use Dr. Krakauer\u2019s colorful descriptions. \u201cThey have what I think of as a support role,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite the potential for lifelong celibacy, wingmen benefited from the arrangement, Dr. Krakauer found \u2014 at least by the raw calculus of evolution. On average, dominant males with wingmen produced seven offspring a season, whereas solo males produced fewer than one. Since the males were closely related, those seven offspring contained more of the wingmen\u2019s genes than if they\u2019d sired a single chick themselves.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re helping their brother get a lot more females than either of them would get on their own, so this cooperation seemed particularly helpful,\u201d explained Dr. Krakauer. \u201cThat seemed to be surprising for people at the time.\u201d",
      "Anyone who\u2019s had a brother knows the vicissitudes of fraternal relations. While brothers generally cooperate during the mating season, intense fighting breaks out at other times, as they jostle for rank. Turkeys have formidable weapons: large bodies, powerful wings and spurred feet. On one occasion, I saw a fight so violent that spittle flew \u2014 like when a boxer is hit by a knockout punch.",
      "While males are aggressive with each other, they aren\u2019t aggressive toward females and do not force copulations, despite being twice the size of their mating partners. So while males may strut with abandon, females ultimately choose their mates. They\u2019re picky about partners and know what they want: males with long snoods.",
      "Snoods are the fingerlike fleshy protuberances that flop over a turkey\u2019s beak. The animals can contract and relax muscles and blood vessels in their head and neck, causing changes in the organ\u2019s length and color. A tom sporting a long red snood draws the attention of hens like flies to honey \u2014 although, to their credit, the hens manage to be coy about it.",
      "Dr. Richard Buchholz, ",
      " at the University of Mississippi, has spent his career studying wild turkeys. He examined the role that various male ornaments \u2014 including snoods, caruncles (pebble-like bumps on the head and neck), skullcaps (thickened skin on top of the head), spurs (talons on the legs) and beards (tufts of hairlike feathers projecting from the chest) \u2014 play in female mate choice. He ",
      " that snood length was the primary factor that explained which male a female chose as a mate. Even a few extra millimeters made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt did surprise me, especially since the snood doesn\u2019t seem to be a very functional thing to choose,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. \u201cWhy the snood and not all the other ornaments on males?\u201d",
      "The answer lies in a phenomenon with deep roots in biology: Fancy accouterments may indicate good genes. For turkeys, a male who can afford to sport a killer snood must have had ample resources, which ostensibly reflects the quality of his DNA. Dr. Buchholz found that males with longer snoods had fewer coccidia parasites, which don\u2019t harm adults but can sicken or kill chicks, and ",
      " that may make them resistant to coccidia.",
      "\u201cEarly on there\u2019s probably a big impact on chick survival,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said, so by choosing longer-snooded males, females may provide their babies with lifesaving parasite resistance.",
      "Dr. Buchholz is still uncertain about the role some other male ornaments play. Like snoods, other fleshy structures on a turkey\u2019s face and neck can change color during displays. For example, males will drain all the blood from the caruncles so they\u2019re as white as a sheet of paper, Dr. Buchholz said. He remains unsure of what the change in the caruncles might signal, or why it\u2019s important.",
      "And what about those fancy feathers? \u201cI don\u2019t know if females care,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. The feathers of male turkeys infected with coccidia ",
      ", which turkeys (but not we humans) can see. However, no one has studied whether females scoff at dull feathers the way they do at puny snoods.",
      "There\u2019s still a lot to learn about wild turkey mating behavior. \u201cFor a bird that\u2019s such a great conservation success story, that\u2019s so common and interesting to people, and that has a cultural connection to the American Thanksgiving, for us to not know more about its behavior is really a shame,\u201d said Dr. Buchholz.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s not entirely surprising. Wild turkey populations are currently ",
      " in many parts of the country, thanks to conservation efforts; in places like New England, Madison and Berkeley, they\u2019re now so common that they get about as much notice from passing motorists as a traffic cone.",
      "But that wasn\u2019t always the case. Until recently, wild turkeys were rare in the United States \u2014 \u201cwhich seems crazy now,\u201d Dr. Krakauer said, \u201csince they\u2019re right in town and blocking traffic.\u201d"

      "In northern Maine, when the last of the wildflowers go golden on their stems \u2014 when the temperatures dip, fishermen pull their traps from the water, hunters wait in the woods and farmers gather the final crops \u2014 the time finally comes for \u201ctipping,\u201d or, as the old-timers call it, \u201cbrushing.\u201d This is the time of year when folks head into the woods to gather the ends of evergreen branches for use in wreaths and holiday trimmings.",
      "Ten-year-old Harbor Eaton lives with her family on ",
      " on Maine\u2019s Schoodic Peninsula. The Eaton family primarily grows produce crops, but balsam-harvesting and wreath-making is a way of extending the farm\u2019s production into the colder, darker seasons. In November and December, Harbor goes out tipping with her family and farm workers on adjacent woodlots, with the aid of their horses, Andy and Starr.",
      "\u201cYou go out into the woods, try to find a tree with good foliage. You take a branch, snap it and make sure it doesn\u2019t have brown spots on it \u2014 \u2019cause you don\u2019t want a brown wreath,\u201d Harbor explained.",
      "Cedar, Harbor\u2019s 7-year-old brother, said that the trick is to use a stick that\u2019s sharpened on one end \u2014 with four branch stubs sticking out \u2014 to stack and collect the boughs into a portable unit.",
      "\u201cDo that over and over till you have filled the stick with branches,\u201d Cedar said. \u201cThen you put the stick on the wagon. You do it all over again until the horses pull us home with all the full sticks.\u201d",
      "Balsam-harvesting is a welcome change of pace for farmers at the end of the season\u2019s crescendo. \u201cAfter spending the majority of our time focusing our energy on the soil and working looking down, we get into the woods and just stare at the trees, looking up toward the sky,\u201d said Liz Moran, who manages Darthia Farm and raises Harbor and Cedar with her partner, Steve Eaton, known as Shepsi.",
      "The process of tipping is hard work: the physical picking and pulling, the weight of the heavy branches. Tippers also need to keep an ear out for hunters in the forests, and pull off ticks at day\u2019s end. But Ms. Moran describes a certain magic about the work: bringing warm treats to eat, noticing the soft patterns in the branches, letting the children play as they work, listening for the barred owl that lives near the entrance of the woodlot. The crew sometimes sing while they work, their voices echoing off the trees.",
      "\u201cThe woods offer such a different acoustic environment than the open gardens and fields,\u201d Mr. Eaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to hear each other in the woods if we are singing.\u201d",
      "In Maine, especially in the state\u2019s Downeast region, generations of people have built lives on seasonal, nature-based work: digging clams, pulling traps on commercial fishing boats, raking blueberries, processing seafood and crops. Harvesting balsam and making wreaths play important roles in this cycle.",
      "Geri Valentine started making wreaths in the 1970s, and it\u2019s still a part of her patchwork of seasonal jobs. As she wire-wrapped handfuls of evergreen around metal rings in a cozy cabin on Darthia Farm, she recalled her early days as a wreather. \u201cBack then, it was mostly a cottage industry \u2014 people would go out in family groups to gather brush,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople like clam diggers and fishermen would go out brushing after the fishing season was over, and it was a way to bring in some income, especially right before Christmas, heading into the lean months.\u201d",
      "Ms. Valentine has chosen a simple life. She lives in a cabin in the town of Addison without electricity and running water; she grows her own food with friends; she drives a used car. \u201cI don\u2019t want very much,\u201d she said. \u201cI change my jobs with the seasons.\u201d",
      "\u201cLiving this way feels very grounded,\u201d she continued. These days, though, people can\u2019t survive as easily on seasonal work, she said. \u201cIf you have a truck payment, if you\u2019ve got a mortgage, if you want to send your kids to college, you can\u2019t swing a life of digging clams in the summer and making wreaths for Christmastime.\u201d",
      "When you talk to locals, they agree: The systems have changed. The bigger wreath manufacturers, including Kelco Industries, Worcester Wreath Co. and Whitney Wreath, likely made the ones you find at your local grocery store or in catalogs. By some estimates, such companies employ about 2,000 migrant workers to harvest materials and work in wreath factories in Downeast Maine \u2014 often the same workers who harvested wild blueberries in summer and who returned to Maine for wreath season.",
      "Among the migrant workers, there have been growing concerns about low wages, substandard housing, exploitative work conditions and a lack of access to health care and education. Nonprofits like ",
      " and the ",
      " provide support to seasonal workers, including those employed by the wreath industry.",
      "This year, local nonprofits collaborated with farmers to gather warm clothes, blankets and supplies for wreath workers who are often unprepared for the cold of New England in November and December. Mounds of donated goods piled up at drop-off sites \u2014 enough that Bo Dennis, a flower farmer and organizer, borrowed a clean cattle trailer to carry it all to Mano en Mano\u2019s office in Milbridge.",
      "Mr. Dennis grows flowers at his farm, ",
      ", in Monroe, Maine, and is also on staff at ",
      ", where he works on programs for beginner farmers. He offers his farmland for other queer farmers to find an entry point to agriculture and rural life. He\u2019s tuned in to the networks of people and plants around him and the ways they may need support \u2014 and this mind-set extends to the forests.",
      "\u201cWhen we harvest, we are pruning a tree,\u201d Mr. Dennis said, explaining that tippers only cut the last 12 to 15 inches of a tree branch \u2014 a sustainable practice. He loaded heavy bags of boughs into his truck, all harvested from a friend\u2019s woodlot, a chunk of clear-cut land that had grown in with thick, scrubby trees.",
      "Mr. Dennis mainly harvests balsam fir, supplemented with cedar, pine and juniper. He is careful about where he harvests, and on whose land. \u201cAs a trans person, I\u2019m hyper-aware that I want to have consent with anything I\u2019m doing, including having consent to the land,\u201d he said.",
      "By percentage, Maine is the most forested state in America; about ",
      ", most of which is privately owned. Independent tippers usually (but ",
      ") get permission from private landowners to gather materials on their land \u2014 and, as with deer hunters or wild mushroom gatherers, tippers often know whom to ask and where to find what they need.",
      ", a forager and artist who uses the name Giant Daughter, looks in a variety of places: overgrown properties that might benefit from pruning, weedy land, areas with trees too thick for them all to thrive. \u201cI also harvest at abandoned sites,\u201d she said, \u201clike an abandoned Burger King that no one is tending to.\u201d",
      "Ms. Alexandrou uses her background in horticulture and farming to influence the ways she gathers her materials. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be taking away,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be using what makes sense to use.\u201d",
      "\u201cI pay attention to the way the plants are growing so that I know my harvesting is good for the ecosystem I\u2019m harvesting from,\u201d she added.",
      "Most tippers will wait for three hard frosts before they harvest. If you bend a balsam bough in the summer, it won\u2019t snap; after a few frosts, it will. The frost allows the branches to be harvested easily, at the right time in the tree\u2019s growth cycle. This year, though, the frosts were worryingly erratic. It was warm enough to harvest in a T-shirt on some days.",
      "Weather patterns, tides, fish, frosts, deer \u2014 these can be the favored conversational subjects in rural Maine. Tipping, too, offers common ground.",
      "\u201cI may have nothing to do with someone most of the year,\u201d Mr. Eaton said, \u201cbut if I\u2019m tipping, there is much to relate to.\u201d",
      "Every so often, while working in the woods, the tippers stop to smell their hands. They smell like pitch, like the inside of trees. Dirt mingles with the sap. I see it over and over: tippers cupping their palms to their face and pulling pine needles from their hair. The smell is earthy and nostalgic. The wreaths will smell this way, too: joyful circles on front doors across the country, formed by the work of strangers, and made from trees that continue to grow."

      "My two sons and I checked in at the Guatemala City airport three hours before the first leg of our return flight to Detroit. As we waited, I received two texts from Spirit announcing that our flight was delayed, first by about 20 minutes and then by an additional 15, making the new departure time 4:18 p.m. We used the delay to get something to eat, monitoring our phones for more updates, but none came. When we returned to our gate at 3:40, we were told the plane had been readied earlier than expected and the doors had closed. The gate staff said it would be three days before another flight was available, and they refused to book us on another airline. We were forced to spend over $3,000 for same-day, one-way tickets on JetBlue. We eventually received a partial $297 credit from Spirit, but we want them to reimburse us for the JetBlue flight, since they should have alerted us when the departure time was again revised. ",
      "If a doctor\u2019s office or hairstylist or friend we\u2019re planning to meet for lunch texts us that they\u2019re running 30 minutes behind, we rightfully feel free to do whatever we want with that half-hour, as long as we show up at the new time. But air travel is an alternative universe filled with odd rules and quirky customs that sometimes fly in the face of real-world logic.",
      "Like you, had I received the same alert, I would have retreated from the crowded, germy gate area to find a restaurant or bar to while away the delay and assumed the airline would ping me if anything changed. But when I polled frequent-flying friends, several told me they would never stray far from the gate. \u201cThey always tell you not to go too far,\u201d said one wizened veteran, a consultant who flies nearly every week.",
      "Turns out they\u2019re right and we\u2019re wrong. And Spirit has it in writing.",
      "When I reached out to them, a spokesman for the airline, Erik Hofmeyer, sent me an initial statement noting that \u201ckey details were missing\u201d from your story, adding that \u201csection 2.4.1 (b) of our Contract of Carriage has some information that you may find useful.\u201d",
      "For anyone not familiar with Spirit\u2019s terms and conditions \u2014 which I\u2019m guessing includes most people reading this as they wait to board a Spirit flight \u2014 here\u2019s section 2.4.1 (b):\u201cIn the event of a delay, guests are recommended to remain in the gate area for updates and possible early departures. Spirit shall not be liable to any guest who misses a flight, which departed earlier than the estimated departure time posted for the delay.\u201d",
      "For a moment, I thought these lines might have been written just for you (\u201cthe Tom from Ann Arbor clause\u201d), but it turns out they were added ",
      ". Spirit is the only airline I could find whose contract is so explicit about the issue, but many note that passengers must be at the gate in advance of the originally scheduled departure time even when there is a delay.",
      "Still, why wouldn\u2019t Spirit send another message updating you when the flight was pushed forward again? Was this a flaw in an automated system, a human mistake, or just the way things work?",
      "Mr. Hofmeyer didn\u2019t provide details, but I did find ",
      " giving airlines 30 minutes to inform passengers of a change in schedule \u2014 perhaps too late in this case \u2014 and even then only by updating their website. Mr. Hofmeyer said that agents called your name five times over the public address system, though you say you didn\u2019t hear it.",
      "You asked Spirit to reimburse the cost of your one-way tickets on JetBlue, noting that otherwise you would have been stuck for three more days in Guatemala. Spirit refused, and is within their rights to do so. Department of Transportation guidelines explicitly state that airlines need not book passengers on competing airlines; their next available flight is sufficient, even if it is a few days later. And the airline doesn\u2019t need to pay for your hotel, either. (Don\u2019t shoot the messenger.)",
      "This is mostly bad news for you, but I do have some good news: You got more money back from Spirit than you originally realized. The $279 you received in March was actually their second payment; apparently you didn\u2019t spot a $457 Spirit credit to your card back in January, right after you missed your flight. Mr. Hofmeyer said that the total of $736 covers the full value of the legs you and your family missed. I have no way of verifying that \u2014 it\u2019s about a third of the full price you paid for the Spirit tickets, but he did not provide a detailed breakdown. In any case, he made it clear that Spirit is not admitting any fault and that this refund is a courtesy.",
      "Of course, a text alerting you that your departure had been moved back up would have been even better. Spirit would not comment on why you never got one, so I spoke with Suresh Acharya, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business who has worked for decades on airline optimization systems. He cautioned that we should not expect all airlines to have equally deft, customer-friendly communications systems. \u201cIt may have just been a manual oversight,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Spirit or another low-cost, no-frills airline, their IT infrastructure and integration are probably not that automated.\u201d",
      "He noted that since delays are costly to airlines, often requiring overtime payments to crews and causing delays that can ripple across the system, airlines will jump on any chance to speed up departures even after delays have already been announced, although it sometimes means leaving passengers behind. This is especially true on international flights and at domestic \u201cslot-controlled\u201d airports where the F.A.A. has imposed limits on takeoffs.",
      "That said, all delays are not created equal. Mr. Acharya passed along some useful tricks he uses when traveling to better guess when a delay is going to stick, or even \u201ccreep\u201d forward, to use frustratingly accurate airline lingo. First, he figures out where the aircraft is. If it\u2019s already at the gate, the delay might not stick if a mechanical issue can be solved faster than projected or crew members stuck in traffic arrive faster than they expected.",
      "If the plane is not at the gate, that could indicate a more definitive or even creeping delay. Check online or ask staff where the incoming aircraft is; if it\u2019s still hours away, that\u2019s a bad sign. On the other hand, if you\u2019re at an airport that serves as the hub of the airline you\u2019re flying (Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for example, for Spirit) they might be able to switch equipment or swap crews more easily.",
      "But I can\u2019t help thinking that there is a very simple solution Spirit could implement that would go a long way toward sparing future customers from your fate: Add one more sentence to its default alerts, urging passengers \u201cto stay at or near the gate at all times.\u201d They could even add, \u201cFor more information, click ",
      " for the contract of carriage,\u201d giving passengers one last opportunity to avoid reading it.",

By contrast, Charles \u2014 the oldest Prince of Wales in British history to become king \u2014 was born a monarch-in-waiting and has had a lifetime to prepare.",

      "By tradition, heirs to the throne don\u2019t meddle in unroyal matters. But Charles was an unusually outspoken Prince of Wales. He is known as a lover of classical music, a student of philosophy and world religions and a proponent of sometimes controversial ideas. He has often waded into debates on unexpected topics like alternative medicine and organic farming (pro) and modernist architecture (against).",

Thus he became the first Prince of Wales ever to receive a university degree.",
      "The young prince was sent to Trinity, the richest of Cambridge University\u2019s 31 colleges. His life there was hardly normal.

      "I\u2019m deep in an Alaskan forest halfway through an 8K race when I find myself alone. Above me, 100-foot spruces bend and bellow, set upon by wind so loud I mistake it for an airplane. Below me, a slushy, icy mess of a trail.",
      "Ahead of me \u2014 no one.",
      "It\u2019s a drizzly November morning. My clothes are wet with rain and my fingers and toes hurt from the cold. I look down at my black running shoes, willing them to move faster. They don\u2019t.",
      "I can no longer see the two women I followed for the first half of the run, and I imagine the gap widening. Then I picture myself on a map: a speck some 4,000 miles away from my home in South Florida. I see my 7-year-old daughter\u2019s chubby cheeks and dirty blond curls, my 5-year-old son with his thumb in his mouth.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to die here, alone,\u201d I think. In the past, I never had thoughts like this. I was all swagger: Back when I lived in Jerusalem, I ran on isolated trails in the forest almost every afternoon. But since filing for divorce in August, I\u2019ve become fearful of being alone. And being in Alaska \u2014 with its vastness, the way it dangles, lonely, at the edge of the continent \u2014 has only magnified those feelings.",
      "I try to catch up with the women, but I\u2019m tapped out, No. 12 in a field of a dozen. I worry: What if everyone finishes and goes home? I don\u2019t have my phone; there will be no way for me to call for help.",
      "And then I ask myself: Why did I come all the way to Alaska on the advice of a total stranger, to chase something I\u2019m not even sure I believe in \u2014 an astrological event called a solar return?",
      "A solar return takes place at the moment when the sun returns to exactly the same location in the sky where it was at the time of your birth, explained Julia Mihas, a San Francisco-based astrologer. This usually takes place every year on or near your birthday.",
      "The thinking behind solar return trips is that just as the place where you\u2019re born has an impact on your birth chart \u2014 which supposedly reveals major themes in your life story \u2014 so can the place where you spend your solar return affect the year ahead. In essence, an astrologer, using your yearly chart, searches for the place where the stars will be most auspicious at the moment of your solar return, and then you travel to that location. It\u2019s like hacking your horoscope.",
      "These trips, known as aimed solar returns, or A.S.R.s, are central to an approach called active astrology, which holds that you can intervene in your fate.",
      "Let me confess that I\u2019m a little woo-woo. I recently bought a small piece of Libyan desert glass \u2014 which is supposed to work with chakras or vibrations or whatever \u2014 and hung it over my desk. But solar return trips \u2014 which I\u2019d heard about from a friend \u2014 seemed out there; I considered one only after my marriage fell apart. That friend connected me to Katia Novikova, a Ukrainian astrologer who lives in Rome.",
      "When Ms. Novikova, a pianist by training, took up astrology in 1995, she immediately began searching for a way to exercise control over the stars. A few years later, she discovered active astrology. Ms. Novikova\u2019s first foray into solar return trips came in 2011, after she did her chart for the year ahead and foresaw her own death. She recalled with a laugh how she used a combination of software and her extensive knowledge of astrology to find a solar return destination \u2014 Barcelona \u2014 where her stars offered a better outcome: \u201cInstead of dying, I changed it for health, for art and for money. It was simple.\u201d",
      "The trip was also easy \u2014 an inexpensive flight from Rome.",
      "Upon returning, Ms. Novikova landed a regular gig as a pianist, and requests for private lessons poured in as well.",
      "So not only did Ms. Novikova continue doing A.S.R.s, she also offered free readings to friends. When word spread and strangers began inquiring about readings, Ms. Novikova started charging.",
      "One of those strangers who found Ms. Novikova is the television writer Safia M. Dirie, who asked not to give her age.",
      "On Ms. Novikova\u2019s advice, Ms. Dirie, who lives in Los Angeles, made her first solar return trip in 2016 to the Cook Islands, a small South Pacific nation, looking to change her luck in love. Less than a year later, she met the man who is now her husband.",
      "The next year, Ms. Novikova sent Ms. Dirie to a tiny town called Swink, population 667, on the southeastern plains of Colorado. Because there were no hotels in Swink and her solar return was taking place in the middle of the night, Ms. Dirie and a friend white-knuckled it from Colorado Springs, a couple of hours away. In the dark, amid a tornado warning, tumbleweeds kept rolling out in front of the car and she kept slamming on the brakes, thinking they were deer.",
      "When Ms. Dirie and her friend arrived in Swink, they found it pitch black, the power knocked out by the storm. They parked in front of a random house until her 2:08 a.m. solar return passed. Then the two \u201cwent over to the next town and got a piece of pie at an all-night diner.\u201d",
      "Ms. Dirie, who likened her own solar return trips to pilgrimages, said that A.S.R.s are \u201cpretty popular\u201d in her Los Angeles circle, but solar return trips aren\u2019t a national travel trend, according to the half-dozen travel advisers I spoke with.",
      "Like a travel adviser, Ms. Novikova tries to understand what motivates a client. After I contacted her via email \u2014 just a month after I\u2019d filed for divorce \u2014 and paid 100 euros, about $110, she had me answer questions about my hopes for the coming year. Then she did her magic and we got on a Whatsapp video chat to discuss the results.",
      "Ms. Novikova started with the chart for my previous birthday. \u201cMiserable,\u201d she said. It was all there \u2014 the rise in expenses, the unwanted move to a cramped apartment, the endless arguments with my husband.",
      "My forecast for 2023 would be best, Ms. Novikova said, if I went to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, at 5:12 a.m. local time on Nov. 13. I Googled the place: Beautiful but remote; the logistics were daunting.",
      "Second: Juneau, Alaska. My stomach turned. Far away. Cold. A dark, foreboding landscape that could swallow me up. There\u2019s the ",
      ", a vast area of wilderness bounded by the cities of Juneau, Anchorage and Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), where many people have gone missing. The state is also surprisingly dangerous, with one of the ",
      " in the country.",
      "No, thanks.",
      "Third place: Brazil. Yes!",
      "Sun, beaches, great food.",
      "But",
      "Ms.",
      "Novikova frowned. \u201cThere are some things I don\u2019t like in this horoscope,\u201d she said. And that was that.",
      "We settled on Juneau, and Ms. Novikova gave me a detailed forecast for the year based on that destination. Not only would I look good physically, I\u2019d have more professional visibility. I\u2019d have luck selling my new book. Ms. Novikova said she saw an editor and a university.",
      "Oh, and love. A dream job, too.",
      "Because it was the off-season in Alaska, I found a round-trip ticket from Palm Beach to Juneau for under $500 and a reasonable rate \u2014 $100 a night \u2014 for a room at the historic ",
      ", which is reportedly haunted. If I\u2019m dabbling in the woo-woo, I figured, I might as well go all out.",
      "Then I looked for a run, a great way to get a workout and a different view of a place from that of most tourists. I was in luck \u2014 the ",
      "\u2019 Veterans Day 8K would take place the day before my solar return.",
      "Arriving in downtown Juneau a few days early, I worked remotely and explored what little was open in the off-season. At the ",
      ", I enjoyed spiced avocado toast, and at the Alaska Native-owned ",
      ", I had a delicious but stomachache-inducing reindeer sausage. I found excellent beer and phenomenal charred carrot hummus at ",
      ". And ",
      " offered spruce tip gin and a smooth, sippable whiskey.",
      "I settled into a routine \u2014 working, running, eating \u2014 and two days in, I didn\u2019t need Google maps anymore.",
      "On the day of the race, I took a bus to a parking lot 10 miles outside town. As a small group of runners gathered, I asked two women if they minded me tagging along. But they were younger, leaner and fitter and they were dressed appropriately \u2014 one had snow grips attached to her shoes \u2014 and I lost the women midway through the run.",
      "Alone in the woods, despairing, I heard someone push through the trees and step onto the trail. Before me was a man I didn\u2019t recognize. He was dressed like a runner, but I didn\u2019t see the yellow bib all the racers wore. He fell into step beside me, explaining that he had stopped to go to the bathroom and decided to wait for me.",
      "Before, I was scared to be out here alone; now, I was frightened by this stranger\u2019s sudden appearance. Trying to push my fear aside, I made small talk. We arrived at a fork in the snowy trail and, because the race was so informal, not all of the course was marked. Both directions were equally covered with slushy footprints and, without anything or anyone to guide us, we puzzled over which way to go.",
      "\u201cRight,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked, worried that he was trying to lead me deeper into the woods.",
      "But separating would have been equally dangerous, so I followed him. And then, suddenly, we were on the shoulder of Glacier Highway, and I was striding toward the finish line as best as I could with numb toes.",
      "\u201cThere they are!\u201d exclaimed the other runners; they cheered us on as the man and I pushed to the end. Not only had they not forgotten about me, they were waiting. A single thought spooled through my head \u2014 I am not alone in this world \u2014 and I choked back tears of gratitude.",
      "That night, at 4 a.m., I woke up \u2014 sans alarm \u2014 just a few minutes ahead of my solar return. Lying there in the dark, I listened for, then heard, the raven\u2019s call, which I\u2019d grown to love while in Juneau. I looked at the phone again, and the time had passed. My solar return was over.",
      "After returning to Florida, I framed and hung the yellow race bib on the wall as a talisman, like the Libyan desert stone I\u2019d bought before the trip, as a reminder of how far I\u2019d traveled and how far I\u2019d come. And three weeks later, just like that, my divorce was final. I had faced my fear of being alone.",
      "Oh, and a couple of months after that, an editor \u2014 from a university press \u2014 made me an offer for my book."

      "On our first morning in the Amazon, we awoke in total darkness. After a 4:30 a.m. breakfast at the Sani Lodge, where our group was staying, my husband, Alexis, and I pulled on our rubber boots. Our birding guide, Jeison Gualinga, whistled for a canoe while flashing his light among the reeds by the main dock. Under branches that arched like the interior of a cathedral, we paddled in two boats through the flooded forests. Howler monkeys whirred like gale-force winds in the distance.",
      "\u201cRinged kingfisher,\u201d Mr. Gualinga whispered, pointing to a perched bird, barely visible in the gloom. Occasionally he\u2019d whistle, perhaps to a ladder-tailed nightjar, or point out an anhinga, with its elegant long neck, still sleeping on a branch, and our boat would rock like a cradle as we drifted in groggy silence, in water the color of chocolate milk.",
      "Our birding trip in Ecuador arose like a bird call, by word of mouth. Our friend Olaf Soltau, a devout birder, was tipped off by a respected birder friend to enlist Pablo Barrera of ",

      "The idea was to see how bird species evolved and multiplied as the elevation lowered, while staying at four comfortable eco-lodges and enjoying Ecuadorean food. There were seven of us in all, including Olaf and his husband, Steve. Our levels of experience varied, from Olaf, the most skilled, to Alexis and me, first-time birders. Our trip would culminate with five days in the ",

      ", in the high Andes region known as the P\u00e1ramo. Ms. Osorio began naming a few birds we\u2019d spotted that afternoon, and soon bird names were ricocheting from seat to seat, a cheery distraction from the precipitous view and the gloomy prospect of getting stranded overnight in an ecosystem comparable to the Arctic tundra. Mr. Barrera contacted the ",
      "; they dispatched a car and two trucks to our rescue, arriving just as night fell.",
      "As we careened through the winding mountain pass of Paso Pallapacta, the light rain switched to blinding fog and sleet. We slid past accidents, breakdowns, police cars, white roadside crosses.",
      "The next morning we were back in the P\u00e1ramo, having packed rubber boots for mud, ponchos for rain, quick-drying pants and socks and, of course, binoculars. Alexis was still adjusting to the roughly 11,000-foot altitude; I felt fine, if a little tired.",
      "The sky was overcast and clouds clung to rocky ledges as we hiked past a primary forest of knobby, slow-growing Polylepis trees that, according to Mr. Panama, had provided habitats for birds in that inhospitable climate for 20,000 to 40,000 years. Rain clicked on electrical wires above us. Cliffs seemed to exhale steam.",
      "Touching a ravaged heart of palm, Mr. Panama observed that a bear had recently been feeding there. I spotted a brown chestnut-winged cinclodes with a little pointy beak, and a slate-blue plumbeous sierra finch with pink legs. Seeing me struggle with my new binoculars, Mr. Barrera kindly removed one of the lens caps.",
      "At our second stop, a spectacled bear, black with goggle-shaped white markings around its eyes, tore through the mist and down a hill, taking shelter behind a cluster of boulders.",
      "Ms. Osorio was ecstatic. \u201cThis is a rare sight!\u201d she cried. \u201cAlexis did you see it? Dorothy, did you see it?\u201d",
      "A black-and-chestnut eagle \u2014 among the most endangered birds of prey in South America \u2014 flew in circles above us, calling. We admired its beautiful black crest and impressive wingspan before it swooped into the canopy. There are only about a thousand left in the world, Mr. Barrera said, in Spanish, tapping his baseball cap. The black-and-chestnut eagle was the logo for his tour company.",
      "The eagle\u2019s strong talons had evolved to pluck red squirrels and small monkeys from trees, Mr. Panama said. \u201cBut now they\u2019ve begun to eat chickens. People think they\u2019re bad luck. So, they kill them.\u201d",
      "When we returned to the lodge for lunch, a fire crackled in the hearth. We sat down at our long communal table to a traditional soup made with peanuts, followed by chicken curry with steamed cauliflower and sweet potato chips. After dinner, staff would pass out hot water bottles in knitted sacks to heat our bedsheets. Guango was rustic, and the rooms were small, but the place had heart.",
      "On our third morning, we watched a breathtaking assortment of hummingbirds buzz around feeders. A hen-like Andean guan and her chicks were perched on a high branch. Two parent torrent ducks taught their chick how to swim in the rapids of the Rio Guango. Afterward we were back in our minibus, chugging above cliffs, in and out of clouds.",
      "Olaf showed us his target list for the first part of our trip. One page long, single-spaced, it named each bird in Latin and English, along with where it was most often spotted and possible locations of where it may be found. The punishing conditions of the high Andes made for far fewer bird species, he explained. \u201cWait until the lower elevations,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cMy lists are two and three times this.\u201d",
      "I gazed out the window. Stunning waterfalls glistened like long needles in the mountainside forest across from us, and the River Quijos cut like a razor through the wooded valley below. But there were an alarming number of oil tanks and storage facilities closer to the road. And a rusted pipeline transporting crude oil up from the Amazon ran alongside the road toward Quito. One portion of pipe bore a graffiti message that translated into \u201cNo more Texaco. Respect and repair.\u201d",
      "On a wide deck that wrapped around the main lodge at ",
      ", Alexis and I sampled fresh-pressed juices. Two russet-colored woodcreepers nipped insects with their long sturdy bills as they marched up and down tree trunks. Green-winged Inca jays, with yellow bellies and black-and-blue faces, fluttered and squawked in nearby branches, and a dazzling array of hummingbirds purred and thumped, jostling for space at assorted feeders.",
      "Mr. Panama spotted a masked trogon perched on a branch. Its red belly and green throat, improbably paired with a black-and-white pinstriped undertail, were all in perfect view when he casually reached for my iPhone to tap an elegant photo through his spotting scope. The mist lifted over the valley. At his suggestion, we hiked to a waterfall near his friend\u2019s reforestation project, where we each planted a native tree.",
      "But I\u2019d just as soon have stayed at San Isidro, the most comfortable of our four lodges, whose spacious cabins each boasted a hammock hanging from a small porch \u2014 some with stunning views. There were miles of fantastic hiking trails on its 4,400-acre property, which bridged two parts of the ",
      ". One trail led to a river with a sandy beach, another to a waterfall. Still another led through primary, uncut forest, where lush ferns draped along branches like drying laundry, and night monkeys crept along the treetops, and a summer tanager devoured a moth, scattering its wings like confetti through the air.",
      "One afternoon, a group of us \u2014 everyone except Mr. Panama and Olaf, who were checking off birds, and our friend Steve, who was recovering from a medical issue and sticking closer to the lodge \u2014 followed Ben Lucking, a volunteer at the lodge, down a trail, where we discovered two brilliant red-orange male Andean cocks-of-the-rock braying across the canopy in full territorial display, their oddly shaped and overstuffed crests bobbing emphatically as they hopped from branch to branch.",
      "It was a bucket-list bird for most of us, and particularly gratifying for our friend Martha, a retired hospice social worker, who had privileged hope over knee pain on the muddy hike down.",
      "Before we arrived at our next stop, ",
      ", in the eastern foothills of the Andes, Mr. Panama passed some loose change to our bus driver, Darwin Vera, who bought a handful of long green pods from a roadside stand. Mr. Panama opened a pod and passed it around, and we sucked on the sweet pulp of ice cream beans.",
      "Wild Sumaco was named after the 13,000-foot volcano that can be seen looming in the distance. The main lodge resembled a huge log cabin, with high ceilings and a big corner fireplace. The food was good, and the proprietor had a sense of humor, appearing on the wide-open veranda one morning while holding a three-foot earthworm, which Alexis immediately grabbed, delighted, as it hung from his fist, undulating like a live rope.",
      "Donning headlamps, we spent a fun night spotting small frogs, snakes and spiders. We saw our first chestnut-eared aracari, a kind of toucan with a signature blue patch around its eye. We also spotted six large black-mandibled toucans feeding in the treetops, their long banana-shaped, yellow-and-black beaks upturned as they called to each other. Seeing a yellow-tufted woodpecker poke holes in a dead palm, Mr. Panama explained that macaws and other birds would eventually make nests there. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of vertical biodiversity,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cOr a high-rise,\u201d joked Alexis.",
      "But after the comfort of San Isidro, the rooms at Wild Sumaco felt more in keeping with a motel. And beyond the lodge\u2019s lush rainforest property, the expanding wildlife was under increasing threat from loggers.",
      "In the somewhat downtrodden oil-industry city of Coca, we bid farewell to Mr. Panama and Mr. Vera. After a night at a utilitarian hotel, we met Mr. Gualinga and his cousin, Gustavo Javier Andy, our guides for the duration of our stay at ",
      ", at the city dock.",
      "The three-hour ride in a motorized canoe along the Rio Napo was broken up by two stops. At the first, we got lucky: Two magnificent harpy eagles high in the canopy were carrying clusters of dried branches to their growing nest in the crown of a ceiba tree. The world\u2019s most powerful bird of prey, the harpy\u2019s wingspan measures up to six-and-a-half feet, and its massive body and four-inch talons are perfect for plucking up monkeys and sloths.",
      "Ms. Osorio burst into tears. Harpy eagles had been spotted along the river a couple of years ago, Mr. Gualinga said, adding that he\u2019d seen them on trips to the area in recent months.",
      "After another bird-filled stop, where we saw our first turkey-like hoatzin \u2014 whose ungainly size and clumsy movements made us all laugh \u2014 we were transferred into two smaller canoes. Mr. Gualinga, Mr. Andy and two additional oarsmen paddled us \u2014 so as not to disturb the wildlife with a motor \u2014 the final 45 minutes, until the Sani Lodge came into view on the far bank of a wide lagoon, Chaluacocha, named after a smallmouth fish native to the area.",
      "As we paddled up to the dock, members of Sani\u2019s staff welcomed us with cocktails of lime-juice, vodka and blue cura\u00e7ao that made our teeth blue. Mr. Gualinga gave a brief introduction in the lodge\u2019s airy open bar. We smiled our blue smiles, happy but weary after a long day, then retreated to our respective thatched cabins, with their lovely polished-wood floors, rotating fans and white towels folded like origami birds on the beds. The canopies were draped with mosquito netting that would be neatly tucked around our mattresses when we returned from dinner.",
      "We spent five blissful days at Sani Lodge, which is owned and operated by the Indigenous Sani tribe. We watched the sun rise over the jungle from a 120-foot-high metal platform \u2014 Mr. Gualinga helped build it when he was 14, he said \u2014 in the crown of a 900-year-old ceiba tree, and waited for scarlet macaws to descend upon a clay-lick to eat minerals that neutralize toxins in their diet. For lunch one day we took instruction from a group of Sani Village mamitas in the community center, folding tilapia and heart of palm into long, green rumi panka leaves, which we then roasted over an open fire, along with two types of plantains and chontacuro beetle larvae. We paddled through flooded forests looking for anacondas and fished for piranhas along a small creek.",
      "Yes, the Wi-Fi at the lodge was spotty. And no, there was no pool. By this point, Olaf had pretty much gone rogue, disappearing with Mr. Gualinga and another rower before the rest of us met for breakfast, and returning long after lunch, only to head out again on his own, returning after we\u2019d finished dinner.",
      "One morning, Martha and I were gazing through our binoculars at a marvelous paradise tanager \u2014 green, blue and red \u2014 when I was filled with a kind of piercing joy that had been sneaking up on me at odd moments. \u201cThis trip is particularly poignant for me,\u201d Martha said, \u201cbecause it may be the last time I see a lot of these birds in the wild.\u201d I put my arm around her, considering this.",
      "Birding is not for everyone. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s for me. What ",
      " for me, however, is experiencing the natural world in all its richness and wonder, and seeing how other people live, and hearing their stories, all while understanding how very different we may be, and also how very similar.",
      "By then, I\u2019d gotten used to my binoculars. I\u2019d also noticed that when Mr. Gualinga tracked a bird, he moved low and quiet through the forest, whistling softly, as if speaking directly to the bird until it responded, when he\u2019d stand very still on one leg, while slowly motioning for us to come look.",
      "On our last morning, as we headed back to Coca in our motorized canoe, Mr. Andy smiled gamely in the driving rain as he pushed large Styrofoam containers packed with our breakfast \u2014 fresh fruit, scrambled eggs and toast \u2014 to the front of our boat. He then handed them out, a parody of a flight attendant on an airplane. Passing around ceramic cups wrapped in napkins, he poured hot coffee from a thermos and offered spoons of sugar to anyone who wanted it. Our alternative to tea in the Sahara was coffee in the Amazon in a torrential downpour. I smiled out at the rain. I am the rain, I thought. I am rain."

An avid British history buff, her interest in the royal family sparked as a teenager watching the 1981 wedding of then Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales.",
      "\u201cHow many times does it happen in one\u2019s lifetime that you get to see a coronation?\u201d said Ms. Higgins Horwitz, 58, who will travel from her home in Skokie, Ill., next week for an organized tour that covers palaces, castles and towers linked to the royal family. \u201cIt\u2019s history in the making.\u201d",
      "Flags and royal emblems are already adorning the streets of London as it prepares to celebrate Britain\u2019s first coronation in 70 years with great pomp and spectacle.",
      "The three-day affair will include a royal procession through central London, a celebrity-studded concert at Windsor Castle, and a national holiday on May 8, as well as street parties across the country.",
      "Areas around Buckingham Palace and the central route known as the Mall are already \u201ccrammed with people,\u201d said Patricia Yates, the chief executive of VisitBritain, the national tourism agency. \u201cThere\u2019s a real interest,\u201d she added.",
      "U.S. travelers \u2014 Britain\u2019s biggest inbound market \u2014 are expected to lead next week\u2019s swell of arrivals. Flight bookings from the United States to Britain are about 10 percent higher in May compared to in May 2019, before the pandemic, according to VisitBritain. According to Hopper, the booking app, they are also more expensive \u2014 round-trip airfares from the United States to London over coronation weekend averaged $733 in mid-April, 21 percent higher than a year earlier.",
      "After the coronation dates were announced, searches for Airbnb rentals in London during the coronation weekend ",
      ", according to the company, which reported U.S. travelers among the top guests in London around the coronation dates, along with travelers from Britain, France, Australia and Germany (the company declined to share booking numbers).",
      "By late March, hotel bookings in London on the booking platform Expedia were 60 percent higher for the coronation weekend compared to the same time last year. By mid-April, rooms were averaging about $350 per night, according to Hopper.",

      "But not all travelers headed to London over coronation weekend are thrilled.",
      "Laura Aveidi, a youth fitness instructor living in Houston, was disappointed to find out that her family vacation to London, which she booked last July, coincided with the festivities. \u201cThe city is going to be packed and it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d Ms. Aveidi said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t interest us.\u201d",
      "Despite booking early, two separate Airbnb hosts canceled Ms. Aveidi\u2019s reservations in central London, leaving her scrambling. She paid almost double her budget for a third Airbnb at the last minute. Though the company reimbursed her for some of her unexpected costs, Ms. Aveidi said planning the trip was a nightmare. \u201cOne hundred percent we would have changed the dates,\u201d she said. (On coronation day, she and her family are taking a day trip to Liverpool to watch a soccer game instead.)",
      "Even some royal fans who attended the Platinum Jubilee are staying home, in what may be a reflection of Charles historically being ",
      " than his mother, Queen Elizabeth. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have the interest this year,\u201d said Ralph Iantosca, a Texas-based ",

      "For people making a longer journey to attend the coronation, the event is not only a celebration of Charles\u2019s coronation, but a way of connecting to their heritage.",
      "Paul Dabrowa, a biotech company founder who lives in Melbourne, Australia, said that being in London for the coronation is a way for him to honor his own family history. Mr. Dabrowa said his family members were displaced from Poland during World War II and resettled by British law in Australia after the war.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of respect for the monarchy,\u201d he said, adding that he had also attended Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral last September. He has not yet made up his mind about her son, Charles, but will be watching the royal procession on May 6 in central London. \u201cIt\u2019s worth giving him a chance and seeing what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Pranay Manocha, a London-based software engineer, will not be with the crowds cheering.",
      "Mr. Manocha, 43, said that the fanfare is poorly timed, considering the rising cost of living in Britain, which has left many people struggling to afford their grocery bills. Additionally, his grandparents were displaced by the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, a legacy of colonialism: Celebrating an institution that had left lasting pain did not seem right, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be insufferable, almost, to see everybody celebrating the very thing that still hurts,\u201d he said, adding that he would be going hiking in Cornwall on May 6 instead. \u201cI hope that the weather will be nice.\u201d"

      " that suggest tipping for everything from a sandwich at a grab-and-go counter to an ultrasound \u2014 consumers are often bewildered by when and how much to tip.",
      "\u201cThis is the hottest topic in etiquette right now,\u201d said Daniel Post Senning, the co-author of \u201cEmily Post Etiquette, The Centennial Edition\u201d and the great-great grandson of the etiquette icon ",
      ". He cites the pressure of inflation, the disruption of the pandemic and the rush back to travel for the unease. \u201cThere\u2019s growing anxiety and public discussion around tipping.\u201d",
      "Offering guidance on when and how much to tip when you travel, etiquette experts, academics and travelers weighed in with the following advice.",
      "Tipping standards at restaurants vary widely around the world. In the United States, the American Hotel & Lodging Association suggests in its \u201cGratuity Guide\u201d leaving 15 percent of the total bill or up to 20 percent for extraordinary service.",
      "\u201cThe minimum is 15 percent,\u201d said Elaine Swann, an etiquette expert and the founder of the ",
      " in Carlsbad, Calif. \u201cIt can be increased from there based on the level of service received.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, tip averages in restaurants nationally had crept up to 18 percent, a standard that fell back to 15 percent more recently as inflation grew, according to Amanda Belarmino, an assistant professor in the hospitality school at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cI don\u2019t think consumers want to be stingy, but everybody\u2019s budget is tight and they\u2019re trying to make trade-off decisions,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite expert advice, consumers may not have a choice. In many American cities, tips are increasingly included in the bill and often are well above 15 percent. A recent ",
      " making the rounds in New York argues for a 20 to 25 percent standard.",
      "At a trendy cocktail bar in Los Angeles recently, an $18 drink came to $24 after an 18 percent gratuity and an additional fee for employee health care. The bartender mentioned that the establishment includes tips in their tallies because it serves many guests from foreign countries where tipping is not standard.",
      "According to the ",
      ", service charges benefit all employees, including cooks and dishwashers as well as waiters. \u201cThe service charge model ensures that employee compensation is fair, reliable and not reliant on the diners\u2019 experience or bias,\u201d said Erika Polmar, the executive director of the coalition.",
      "Beyond the United States, tip amounts vary, as illustrated in ",
      " Often, they are less than in the United States and are sometimes included as a service charge (see the section below on tipping abroad).",
      "Some tip requests should be denied, according to experts.",
      "For example, when you\u2019re ordering coffee or a sandwich from a kiosk or counter and are presented with a payment screen including suggested tip amounts, \u201cPush past that awkwardness and push no tip,\u201d Ms. Swann said. \u201cProprietors are offering a perk to employees and they\u2019re putting it on the backs of consumers to absorb.\u201d",
      "Caving in to social pressure or even a scowl from the employee is, in Ms. Swann\u2019s opinion, \u201cgiving in to a level of entitlement that should be nonexistent.\u201d",
      "The growth of credit card payments over cash has made it harder to show a token of appreciation via the tip jar, especially if you\u2019re not carrying cash. If in the past you would pay with cash and leave the coins, Mr. Senning advised rounding up on your credit card and doing the same thing virtually.",
      "Beyond restaurants, travel offers many other opportunities to leave tips for service providers such as cabdrivers, bellhops and valets. Before she takes a trip, Ms. Swann goes to the bank to get cash, especially the $1 and $5 bills that are nearly impossible to withdraw from A.T.M.s.",
      "Most experts agree taxi or rideshare drivers deserve 15 to 20 percent of the fare, depending on the service and the cleanliness of the vehicle. (Ms. Swann once rode in a rideshare car filled with dog hair and made the rare decision not to tip.)",
      "Airport skycaps and the bell people at a hotel should get a few dollars a bag, based on service, and perhaps more if the task is onerous, like handling golf or ski bags. Valet parkers should get $2 to $5 at drop-off and pickup.",
      "And if you only have larger bills, Ms. Swann added, it\u2019s perfectly fine to ask for change back.",
      "Etiquette experts say hotel guests should leave $2 to $5 a night for the housekeeper each morning. The American Hotel & Lodging Association recommends $1 to $5 a night left daily, preferably in a marked envelope making it clear that it is intended for the housekeeper. In its ",
      ", UNITE HERE, the labor union whose members include hotel workers, suggests a minimum of $5 a day and more for suites.",
      "Not many travelers comply.",
      "Despite having the most physically demanding jobs in hotels with few avenues for advancement, \u201chotel housekeepers are some of the least-often tipped employees in the service industry,\u201d according to Dr. Belarmino of U.N.L.V. \u201cUnlike servers, who are often paid less than minimum wage that is then made up by tips, hotel housekeepers\u2019 pay is not contingent upon tips. However, it is a courtesy to tip them.\u201d",
      "But in the age of ",
      " or optional room cleaning, which has become more common since the pandemic, the guidelines get murkier. \u201cIf you stay one night or if you choose to skip housekeeping, I would recommend tipping about $5 at checkout,\u201d Dr. Belarmino said.",
      "If housekeeping is available on demand, most experts recommend tipping each time the room is serviced. And you may want to consider raising the amount.",
      "\u201cIf the hotel won\u2019t do daily housekeeping, make sure to tip extra on the days that you do get service and at checkout, because rooms that have gone days without housekeeping are dirtier and harder for housekeepers to clean,\u201d wrote D. Taylor, the international president of UNITE HERE, in an email.",
      "Customs regarding gratuities vary by country. On some trips abroad, guides with the high-end tour company ",
      " use orientation sessions to advise guests on when to tip in unexpected places \u2014 like bathrooms in Egypt \u2014 and provide travelers with small denominations in the local currency to do so.",

      ", which publishes travel guidebooks covering 48 countries, including advice on how to tip.",
      "In countries like Mexico, where wages are low, she advised tipping in restaurants as you might at home. In Europe, where waiters are paid better, tipping is less important. On trips to London and Paris last summer, she found bills with service fees included, often listed as \u201cS.C.\u201d for \u201cservice charge.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know, you might tip on top of that,\u201d she said, recommending that travelers scrutinize their bills and ask if something is unfamiliar.",
      "In Italy, travelers might find a nominal charge called a \u201ccoperto\u201d on their bill covering bread and water.",
      "\u201cIt comes from the days when you would go to an inn and if you wanted to have a tablecloth and plates, they charged you for it,\u201d said Pam Mercer, the owner of California-based ",
      ", which specializes in small-group travel in Italy and France.",
      "When it comes to restaurant meals in those countries, \u201cThere\u2019s not a hard and fast rule,\u201d Ms. Mercer said. Her company advises guests to tip 5 to 10 percent at restaurants and give the tip directly to the waiter.",
      "In cafes and cabs, she rounds up and leaves the change.",
      "\u201cFrance pays its employees a living wage, unlike the U.S.,\u201d wrote Janice Wang, an American living in France who runs a Facebook group for expatriates there, in an email. \u201cHence, servers, hairdressers and cabdrivers don\u2019t need tips to live. They appreciate them, but don\u2019t need them. And they never expect a tip.\u201d",
      "Guide services come in many varieties \u2014 from a walking tour leader to a mountaineer who helps you navigate a rock face. Travelers might engage their services for a half-day trip, a two-week tour, and everything in between and beyond.",
      "The global tour company ",
      " states on its website that \u201ctipping is never compulsory, but always appreciated,\u201d while also making the point that tips are a big part of a guide\u2019s income, especially in the United States and Southeast Asia. On a multiday small-group trip in the United States, the company suggests tipping $7 to $10 a day.",
      "The tour company ",
      " notes that 10 to 20 percent of the trip cost for its wilderness outings is standard where it operates in Seward, Alaska. The tip for a group ",

      "But the platform ",
      ", where local residents set prices for their own tours, discourages tips.",
      "\u201cThe guides are in essence entrepreneurs, rather than employees, and we suggest that the best tip a traveler can leave is to return to the site and leave a thoughtful review, which will help that guide to grow their business,\u201d wrote Paul Melhus, the co-founder and chief executive of ToursByLocals, in an email.",
      "Free tours make it trickier to calculate tips, even though guides work solely for gratuities. ",

      " on May 6, the world will witness, for the first time since his mother\u2019s coronation in 1953, a ceremony that packs more than 1,000 years of British pomp and pageantry into a single day. But for some people, one day might not be enough.",
      "Britain teems with castles that offer travelers a chance to walk the same halls and sleep in the same quarters as monarchs of days gone by. Those who revel in the grand spectacle unfolding in Westminster Abbey may also want to soak in the noble lore in the old stone walls of some of those castles.",
      "\u201cThe sheer drama of the past thousand years of royal history in Great Britain is like a long-running soap opera,\u201d said Tracy Borman, a London-based royal historian and the author of ",
      ",\u201d a history of the British monarchy from William the Conqueror to Charles III. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the king who marries six times, the virgin queen, the crown changing hands numerous times on the battlefield, abdication, usurpations, scandal. It\u2019s basically the best drama you could ever hope for.\u201d",
      "Sleeping in a castle can feel like playing a bit part in that sweeping tale. \u201cWhen people stay in a castle they never forget it,\u201d said Roger Masterson (a.k.a. the Castle Man), founder of ",
      ", a travel company and booking platform that works with more than 100 castles across the United Kingdom.",
      "In the past year, Mr. Masterson said he had noticed an increase in Scottish castle bookings in particular, which he attributed to the coverage of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral and the royal family\u2019s journey back to London from ",
      ", where the queen often spent her vacations. \u201cIt really showed off Scotland at its best,\u201d he said.",
      "These six British castles may not be Balmoral, but they still give travelers a chance to steep themselves in history and get a taste of living, if not like royalty, at least like nobility.",

      "But it\u2019s the castle\u2019s storied history as the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII, that makes it a popular day trip from London. \u201cAnne decided to marry Henry when she was living here in 1526, which ultimately led to her own coronation via the break with the Catholic Church in Rome \u2014 a decision that changed the face of Europe and the course of history,\u201d said Owen Emmerson, Hever Castle\u2019s historian.",
      "Visitors overnighting at the 27-room bed-and-breakfast or the four-bedroom cottage nestled within the estate\u2019s 125-acre grounds receive complimentary access to relic-filled exhibition rooms and a four-acre Italianate garden. The castle\u2019s oak-and-walnut-paneled rooms house artifacts including a prayer book belonging to Boleyn that bears her inscriptions and signature.

Travelers can rent the private wing, which sleeps 16 guests in eight bedrooms. An atmosphere of nobility reigns in the dining room, drawing room and long gallery, which are filled with regal furnishings, including ivory, porcelain, royal portraits and silk brocade wall coverings. Outside, the estate\u2019s 100 acres charm visitors with flowering gardens, 250-year-old Douglas fir trees, and a star-shaped maze of green and copper beech hedges designed to evoke the Earl of Mansfield\u2019s family tartan.",

      "Perhaps the most famous visit to the palace came in 1842 when Queen Victoria and Prince Albert stayed on their way to the Highlands (at considerable expense to the Fourth Earl, who expressed in a letter the inconvenience of the visit, but also knew that declining was not an option).

Opulent interiors include period d\u00e9cor, four-poster beds and silk wall hangings. Outdoors, guests can partake in traditional country pastimes like archery and hatchet throwing, and even enjoy a falconry display.",

      "In late winter of last year, Maria Kitsopoulos, a member of the New York Philharmonic since 1996, arrived for rehearsal with a cello on her back and Rubbermaid container in hand. Inside, she had tucked little squares of homemade cheesecake, the luscious filling held together by two layers of flaky pastry. \u201cMusicians love free food,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey see that box and come running.\u201d",
      "She made sure that the first pieces went to the stage manager and stagehands. (\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who find cushions for you,\u201d she said.) Then, just before going onstage, she handed the last squares to an assistant of the guest conductor, Gustavo Dudamel, the Venezuelan superstar with a halo of dark curls who, in 2009, took over the Los Angeles Philharmonic and has led it to glory ever since.",
      "She didn\u2019t know if her small offering would be left to languish in a dressing room. But at the end of the concert later that evening, after the thrilling race to the end of Schumann\u2019s Fourth Symphony and with the audience aroar, Dudamel turned to the cello section, gave her a thumbs-up and mouthed, \u201cGreat cheesecake.\u201d",
      "Apparently he never forgot it. In February, news broke that Dudamel \u2014 a singular figure both exalted in the insular classical-music world and adored by the public, and even granted his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame \u2014 would become the music and artistic director of the New York Philharmonic in 2026. (Trumpets blare!) As reported in The New York Times, when Dudamel returned to Lincoln Center to meet with his colleagues to be, ",
      " in his decision to cross the continent.",
      "Surely the powers that be at the Philharmonic had mustered many temptations in their campaign to win Dudamel away from the West Coast. But in the end, was it a humble cheesecake that tipped the scales? I reached out to my daughter\u2019s cello teacher, Wolfram Koessel, a member of the American String Quartet who regularly plays with the Philharmonic. \u201cHave you heard about this cheesecake?\u201d I texted.",
      "Immediately the phone rang. It turned out that Kitsopoulos was a close friend of Koessel\u2019s and made the same cheesecake six years ago when they were playing at a festival in Vail, Colo. He, too, never forgot it. Even though Kitsopoulos accidentally burned it \u2014 \u201cthe altitude,\u201d she said with a sigh when I asked her later \u2014 Koessel\u2019s daughter, then 8, still insists that it\u2019s the best cheesecake she\u2019s ever had.",
      "What kind of cheesecake withstands burning and triumphs, and sears itself into the memories of child and worldly wise alike? The ingredient list is brief: for the filling, only cream cheese, sugar and vanilla extract. And the crust isn\u2019t gently coaxed and toiled over. It comes from a can: crescent-roll dough, which pops out with a twist \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s so fun to open,\u201d Kitsopoulos said \u2014 unfurls, turns fluffy when baked and is somehow precision-engineered to evoke the rich, milky purity of the fattest butter (even if the dough might contain vegetable shortening instead).",
      "Unknown to Kitsopoulos, who grew up in New Jersey, she had stumbled on a Southwestern tradition: a mash-up of cheesecake and sopapillas, pieces of dough dropped into hot oil until they puff into little pillows and often served dusted with cinnamon sugar and dripping with honey. The origins of sopapillas, also spelled sopaipillas, go back to Latin America \u2014 the word is believed to derive from Mozarabic, a medieval Spanish-Arabic vernacular \u2014 and regions of the United States that were once part of Mexico. In 2003, Texas briefly proclaimed the sopaipilla as its official state pastry (alongside strudel) and \u201ca much-savored part of Texans\u2019 shared cultural identity.\u201d \u201cSopapilla cheesecake\u201d was the dish most Googled during Thanksgiving week in Texas and Oklahoma from 2004 to 2013. Oklahoma State University even features a recipe on its website, one of seemingly countless online.",
      "Kitsopoulos took a recipe from Pillsbury, developed by Deborah Harroun, the writer of the Taste and Tell blog. The cellist made a few adjustments: a little less sugar and a lot more cinnamon. Baking, like music, demands discipline and precision, but in the kitchen, Kitsopoulos is the least fussy of bakers, approximating more than measuring. Where Pillsbury advises first rolling out the dough for the topping on parchment paper, she just plops it on. \u201cI\u2019m so not an exact person,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m flying by the seat of my pants. Sometimes I forget I have something in the oven.\u201d",
      "In December, when the young Finnish maestro Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 came to town \u2014 \u201che looks exactly like my son,\u201d she said \u2014 she gave him brownies. \u201cHe had eight of them,\u201d she recalled in wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t think they give the guest conductors enough food.\u201d"

      "The first episode of the new female-fronted television adaptation of David Cronenberg\u2019s 1988 psychological thriller, \u201cDead Ringers,\u201d splices together footage of four live births with shocking forthrightness. A plastic-gloved hand grips the bloody head of a newborn and tugs it from the birth canal as another cradles it from below; a baby is pulled briskly out using a pair of elongated metal forceps clasped around its skull; a scalpel is drawn sharply through the surface of a prepped and sterilized abdomen during an emergency cesarean section; hands are thrust inside and a small body is lifted up. \u201cWhy are you wearing my vagina like it\u2019s a [expletive] glove?\u201d shouts one patient at the doctors working busily out of view.",
      "The montage is a feverish, pugilistic sequence of grunts and cries that presents modern obstetrics as a high-volume industry, an assembly line made up mostly of soft, fleshy parts and powered by adrenaline. When at last the twin gynecologists who are the focal point of the series (both played with startling acuity by Rachel Weisz) are able to pause and rest for a moment in the quiet of an empty hospital room, I couldn\u2019t help letting out my own sigh of vicarious exhaustion.",
      "In the television world, babies are a convenient way to reinvigorate stale interpersonal dynamics, or a point of narrative pressure that forces characters to make dramatic choices. But births, in all their beauty and gore, are rare. We\u2019re used to a certain sleight of hand, carefully placed cuts and scenes where fresh-looking mothers in hospital gowns hold clean, swaddled infants in their arms. Real birthing is something more radical: Pregnancy involves a terraforming of the body that might appear terrifying if you were to see it at time-lapse speed. Inside a pregnant body, the volume of blood can increase by at least a third: It swells the hands and limbs; fluid accumulates in some tissue, like the legs, causing it to bloat like an oversaturated sponge. Soaked in hormones that relax the tendons and ligaments, the joints in the pelvis loosen and the shape of the foot is remolded under greater weight. During labor, the pelvic floor, which helps to hold organs in place, can stretch or tear permanently, causing them to resettle in unfamiliar ways.",
      "Thinking about all this puts birth in a different generic register depending on how it is framed and depicted. Having a child might be a blessing or a difficulty within the tropes of a domestic drama, but the actual mechanics of bringing that child into the world verge on body horror, the genre perhaps best typified by the films of David Cronenberg. He made his reputation as a horror auteur with movies like his 1986 remake of \u201cThe Fly,\u201d in which a scientist accidentally fuses his DNA with that of a common housefly. In his worlds, familiar physiology is bent into strange new shapes, showing us that the seeming fixity of our bodies is only a soothing illusion.",
      "Weisz had been fascinated by both Cronenberg\u2019s \u201cDead Ringers,\u201d which she saw in the theater in 1988, and the real-life story of the Marcus brothers (renamed Mantle in the film), twin gynecologists who, having withdrawn from public view, were found dead in the apartment they shared in New York City in 1975, their messy lodgings strewn with bottles of opioids and barbiturates. These \u201cmiracle workers\u201d who specialized in helping barren women conceive and give birth, met an end that cast doubt on the infallible authority of doctors. The story cut to one of the insoluble tensions in reproductive care: that the individual assigned to work so intimately with your hopes and fears and physiology is essentially a complete stranger \u2014 maybe even a dangerous one.",
      "Cronenberg\u2019s film played up the psychic conjunction of the twins, a monstrous codependency that functions perfectly until, suddenly, it does not. Weisz\u2019s new adaptation is less claustrophobic, less a psychological study than a psychosexual thriller in the vein of some of her favorite films in the genre, ",
      " (1980) and ",
      " (1973), in which the externalizing of the characters\u2019 private desires and fears rearranges the world itself. Beverly and Elliot \u2014 one a nurturing obstetrician, the other driven by an insatiable appetite for food, sex and biomedical research \u2014 are working to open a slick, hyper-modern birthing center and seek funding from an ultrawealthy investor. Beverly\u2019s goal is \u201cto change the way women give birth, forever,\u201d but Elliot\u2019s is something more fluid \u2014 she wants to continue her illicit laboratory work growing fetuses in artificial wombs, but most of all she wants to make her twin sister\u2019s dream a reality. They negotiate, in alternating agreement and opposition, the contradictory drives toward individuation and the need for others, repulsion and love.",
      "What \u201cDead Ringers\u201d manages to get on the screen feels, in terms of television, urgent and new. It publicizes bodily processes long held in a secretive personal space, making them available for discussion. Together with her collaborators, Weisz \u2014 who is an executive producer on the show as well as its star \u2014 has summoned a discordant vision of female experience: the grisly, unsettling and unexpectedly beautiful fact that birthing is a life-altering event rather than a collective fantasy.",
      "spoke with Weisz over Zoom from her home in upstate New York. She wore a plain shirt and thick glasses of crystal-clear acrylic that gave her the look of the most stylish professor on a comp-lit dissertation committee. Weisz radiates the poise that was the signature of her early career, looking impassive until something unexpected grabs her attention and she breaks into a warm smile. As we spoke, her bearing made me search myself continually for something pleasing to say. Dark-haired, heavy-browed and possessed of an intent gaze, she still has the features of the fresh-faced English rose who stepped into the spotlight in Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s ",
      " The face holds more emotion now, and has a greater capacity to convey softness or threat or an ambiguous sort of danger lying beneath its placid surface.",
      "In recent years, as Weisz has moved into a more boundary-pushing phase of her career, you can see her cracking the beautiful, cultivated exterior to reveal moments of vulnerability and even ugliness that touch the viewer at a visceral level. These characters \u2014 like the power-obsessed Lady Sarah of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s ",
      " or the willful and transgressive Ronit Krushka of ",
      " \u2014 are women of appetite who evoke curiosity rather than simple admiration. Watching these performances, you have the feeling that something instinctive and utterly convincing has roared to life within Weisz. Her performance as the driven, obsessive Mantle twins is an extension of this movement toward playing women who don\u2019t represent some ideal, but are instead embodied, desirous beings struggling to negotiate the weight of that desire.",
      "When Weisz proposed a gender-flipped version of \u201cDead Ringers\u201d to a producer at Annapurna Pictures, she was intrigued by the intricately enmeshed personalities of the twins, the way they negotiated their fraught obsession with each other. \u201cIt just seemed a very fertile ground,\u201d Weisz explained. \u201cA twisted, codependent relationship between identical twins, whatever their gender, who are brilliant in their careers.\u201d Unlike Jeremy Irons\u2019s diametrically opposed siblings in the Cronenberg film, whose complementary personalities could seem to form a single person, Weisz\u2019s are intricately enmeshed: Though Beverly is introverted, she\u2019s hardly passive, and pursues both her love affairs and the mission of creating a more humane, women-directed way of birthing with quiet focus. Elliot curbs her own scientific imagination, her appetite for grander interventions like eliminating menopause or aging, in service of what she perceives to be Beverly\u2019s needs. Weisz fills the dual roles of Beverly and Elliot with her own raw, organic power, guiding patients through labor with quick, steady hands and a tone that\u2019s firm almost to the point of coldness.",
      "But some of the most affecting moments in the series come when she\u2019s tapping into maternal vulnerability, as when she portrays Beverly\u2019s discovering that she\u2019s had another miscarriage, the latest in a gutting series. The camera hovers over her hand holding a bloody piece of toilet paper in a shot that is almost from a first-person perspective. The effect for me, as a viewer, was the opposite of an out-of-body experience: It was a sight that I had only experienced in my own life, and for a moment my mind raced through the consequences that it implied \u2014 was I menstruating, had I forgotten to take my pill, was there something deeply wrong inside of me? You could say that the series normalizes these physiological processes by showing them onscreen, but they are already normal \u2014 they\u2019re just the unseen part of the iceberg that is having a body.",
      "Weisz\u2019s experience as a parent \u2014 she\u2019s a devoted mother of two who had her second child in 2018 at age 48 \u2014 has gone hand in hand with her decisions to explore these looser, rawer, less polished characters with their unusual thirsts and hungers. When I asked her about her own experience with birthing, what she remembered most intensely was the horrifying tales of deliveries gone wrong that others seemed eager to tell her. \u201cThe one thing I did notice the first time I was pregnant was the amount of times people came to me to tell me terrible stories, some terrible things that happened,\u201d Weisz said. In response, she actively sought out accounts of positive outcomes, to get a sense of all the possibilities, all the branching pathways. She gravitated toward Ina May Gaskin, a midwife and prolific author who pioneered techniques for low-intervention birth and home birthing. In the then-male-dominated field of obstetrics, Gaskin was the first midwife to have a procedure named after her \u2014 the Gaskin maneuver, adapted from the practice of Guatemalan midwives, in which turning a woman from her back onto her hands and knees helps to ease the baby\u2019s shoulder through the birth canal. Just as Gaskin pushed for women to be able to give birth outside the specialized medical environment of the hospital, a common refrain throughout the show is the idea that pregnancy is not a disease, and pregnant women are not sick. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to possibly be cured,\u201d Weisz said, paraphrasing Beverly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you. It\u2019s just a natural part of life.\u201d",
      "\u201cDead Ringers\u201d is a sort of antidote to this culture of pressurized, overdetermined moralizing over the ways that women choose to navigate the experience of pregnancy \u2014 or at least a temporary anesthetic. Though it engages with important issues about reproductive technology and birthing, it also seeks out a deliciously profane set of possibilities. The notion of the nuclear family could be retooled, could mean a pair of identical twin sisters raising the offspring of an ex-lover\u2019s brother, or an uncanny Southern Gothic brood of perpetually pregnant daughters, headed up by a pontificating patriarch obsessed with the eminent gynecologist J. Marion Sims, who conducted experimental anesthesia-free surgical operations on enslaved women. Breeding could be a house of horrors, or a laboratory of startlingly new kinds of tenderness, as in a scene in which Beverly\u2019s lover, Genevieve, a TV star who was once her patient, delivers an erotic monologue about how she wants to impregnate her. Under the existing laws of biology and anatomy, the fantasy is impossible, but only narrowly so: In the world the twins want to create, desire can meet reality in dark, mischievous, complex ways.",
      "To bring that vision to life, Weisz collaborated with the screenwriter and award-winning playwright Alice Birch, whose play \u201cAnatomy of a Suicide,\u201d an exploration of mental illness as experienced by three generations of women within a single family, was performed at the Atlantic Theater Company across a stage divided into three sections. \u201cShe\u2019s so brilliant at creating all those levels of complexity where you\u2019re, hopefully, in a state of pleasure, being entertained and you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s right or wrong,\u201d Weisz explained. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t clear.\u201d",
      "Soon after meeting, they began riffing on topics such as the French performance artist Sophie Calle and imagining the twins\u2019 parents \u2014 ordinary anorak-wearing Brits \u2014 standing in the rain gazing at the magnificent birthing center created by their terrifying daughters. In the end they agreed that the Mantle twins\u2019 new gender changed \u201ceverything and nothing.\u201d Though their anatomy allowed for plot points that the male Mantles would never have encountered, the twisted specificity of their entanglement is in a moral and psychological world all their own.",
      "In Cronenberg\u2019s \u201cDead Ringers,\u201d the twins\u2019 female patients are little more than loci for the projection of male fantasies and fears. The mutated women Beverly hallucinates signal his alienation from the female bodies that are the site of his work. Unsurprisingly, the consequence of swapping the gender of the story\u2019s protagonists is a more robust interest in women and pregnancy \u2014 the deliveries, miscarriages, the intense and intractable particularity of each patient\u2019s reproductive situation. \u201cIt just, I suppose, happened as a result of the doctors having the same bodies as their patients,\u201d Weisz said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t \u2018other\u2019 to them.\u201d Women in Weisz\u2019s series are what they are \u2014 complex, self-destructive, occasionally destructive of others \u2014 and the horror comes directly from their actions, from whom they can\u2019t help being. The most graphic and upsetting moments of the series foreground routine obstetric procedures that are rarely viewed outside their specialized audience \u2014 C-sections, vaginal births, the movements and turnings of infants beneath the skin of the mother\u2019s stomach \u2014 which brings up the question of why we as viewers are so insulated from the realities of reproduction. Horrific to whom? Disturbing for what reason? And whom does it serve to make birthing so opaque, so secretive?",
      "vision",
      "began to take shape, Birch gathered a writers\u2019 room made up of eight women. Weisz sat in on writing sessions, and there were occasional visitors: midwives, gynecologists, endocrinologists and embryologists who gave their thoughts on what needed to change in the way we view and support birthing. Under lockdown and Zooming in from various locations \u2014 some had moved back in with their parents; another became pregnant during the writing sessions while living on a boat off the coast of Cornwall \u2014 the writers shared stories and experiences of their own. Even amid discussions about the dystopian state of modern reproductive care, there was a distinctly utopian imagination at work. \u201cHow do we ",
      "think what we think of as normal, and how do we make ",
      "mysterious what is still inherently mysterious?\u201d asked Lileana Blain-Cruz, a director who participated in the writers\u2019 room as a dramaturg. \u201cIt becomes a philosophical question \u2014 not just of the mystery of it, but of how systems inhibit progress and thinking.\u201d",
      "The writers\u2019 room was intent on directing the viewer\u2019s attention away from the debate over how a pregnant body ",
      " be, and toward the more open-ended question of how pregnancy ",
      " be: There could be soothing depictions of natural landscapes, soft silicone instruments, rigorously tailored personalized care. There could be gene editing, immortal wombs, eternally youthful skin and freshly grafted ovarian tissue. There\u2019s an argument to be made that it\u2019s impossible to talk about improving reproductive outcomes without talking about abortion rights; that it\u2019s discriminatory to talk about fixing the way women give birth without addressing the high maternal mortality rates of Black and Native American patients; that it\u2019s anachronistic to talk about pregnancy as though it were a thing experienced only by cis women \u2014 this show engages only tangentially with these topics. Instead, it takes hold of contemporary debates over medical ethics and class inequities in reproductive care, and treats them as playground equipment, as the terrain on which psychological dramas of a wild and unpredictable nature can be played out. As the arc of the show grows increasingly macabre, some of the portentous weight of birthing \u2014 the need to make the perfect choices, to give birth in an ideal and aspirational way \u2014 gives way to a wicked sense of fun.",
      "So much of the anxiety around reproduction in the United States has to do with the contradiction of being dependent and isolated at once: dependent on a health care system that must be paid for privately; dependent on a political apparatus outside your control that can force you to give birth while denying any resources or care to the baby that is born; isolated by the moral codes and prescriptions that circulate in the media and among the people in our lives. We often approach pregnancy with a hunger for clean, clear answers \u2014 the exact week at which a pregnant body should no longer be allowed caffeine or soft cheese, or the moment at which a bundle of cells becomes a legally protected human being \u2014 but living matter resists these attempts at containment.",
      "The womb is itself a paradoxical thing. In preparing for pregnancy, an entirely new organ, the placenta, is created. It infiltrates the uterine blood vessels and grows over 150 miles of capillaries to provide nutrients and oxygen to the developing fetus before it is unceremoniously expelled from the womb during birthing. But the placenta\u2019s origin blurs the distinction between host body and fetus: Though it originates from cells in the outer layer of the embryo that burrow their way into the womb using a combination of digestive enzymes, substances that trigger suicide in target cells and by impersonating the host\u2019s blood vessels, it is built in part from motherly resources. One\u2019s self mingles with another across a semiporous border. By drawing boundaries, we lose sight of our radical interrelation.",

      "On a recent Monday afternoon at York University in Toronto, Dr. Christina Sharpe was waiting for her students to arrive. Campus felt sleepy, blanketed in snow from a recent storm. They trickled in, arranging themselves around the classroom. That week they were discussing ",
      " No one in attendance had read the book before.",
      "Sharpe pulled out her copy, which she has had for more than 30 years and keeps carefully sheathed in protective plastic. Sharpe, who is 57, sat poised in a black tunic over black pants and boots, her red lips immaculate. She smoothed a hand over the well-worn cover. The book was fat with stickie notes and tabs, its pages so marked up with highlights, exclamations, notes and annotations that it resembled a devotional.",
      "Historically, narratives about slavery prioritized white readers, displaying atrocities to rouse support for abolition. Morrison\u2019s fifth novel, in contrast, focuses on the interiority of the enslaved and formerly enslaved, placing the textures of their lives at the center of the story. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this book for a long time,\u201d Sharpe told the class. It \u201ccompletely rewired how one could write and think about slavery.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeloved,\u201d at its core, is a story of multiple hauntings: The remnants of trauma left in those forced to be property, the fury of a petulant baby-spirit that seems to come back from the dead to find the mother who killed her rather than let her be taken into enslavement. The book holds horrors, but it also raises questions about the beginning of freedom time. \u201cFreeing yourself was one thing,\u201d Morrison writes, \u201cbut claiming ownership of that freed self was another.\u201d The work of embodiment, belonging and rest become the central themes for the characters and, by extension, the readers. For Sharpe, \u201cBeloved\u201d is rich in techniques for refusing the logic of slavery. One of those is infanticide; another, Sharpe shared with the class, is love.",
      "She held the book aloft and read the title aloud: \u201cBeloved.\u201d She paused and reframed the word for us. \u201cBe loved.\u201d The name of the book, Sharpe told the class, is \u201can injunction, a command, a wish, a plea, a lamentation.\u201d To love the self, to believe the self worthy of love and to let that love radiate out and fill up others around you.",
      "A thick silence settled over the classroom as the students absorbed the force of the revelation. The first and final words of the book were not merely an epitaph on a grave: They were instructions for living. Be loved. What I was witnessing, I later realized, was more than a lecture. It was a portal into Sharpe\u2019s methodology. \u201cI think with \u2018Beloved\u2019 almost every day,\u201d she later told me.",
      "Like Morrison, Sharpe \u2014 who is a professor of English literature and Black studies \u2014 is intent on showing how language is like a knife: a tool or weapon depending on who is wielding it. She also understands the way terms like \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201canti-Blackness\u201d run the risk of losing their potency as they become more familiar and commonplace. Sharpe refuses the devaluation of these words and resuscitates them with her critical analysis and poetic reflections.",
      "The book Sharpe is best known for, ",
      " landed in the fall of 2016, just as the final delusions of a post-racial America were disintegrating amid the rise of white nationalism. The book begins with a stark declaration: Black death is foundational \u2014 even necessary \u2014 to American democracy. Death, literally, but also spiritually, culturally, socially. Sharpe is not the first academic, poet or artist to assert that the negation of Black humanity that began with the Middle Passage is still animating American life, but she offered a new metaphorical framework for understanding how.",
      "\u201cIn the Wake\u201d roiled the academic world. It appeared during a \u201craging and at times venomous debate between Black optimism and Black pessimism,\u201d says Saidiya Hartman, author of \u201cWayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments,\u201d who met Sharpe nearly a decade ago at a conference and has become a close friend. \u201cChristina\u2019s work totally unsettles that binary. She addresses the structural conditions of anti-Blackness that condemn Black people on a variety of levels and still attends to the richness of Black social living, and it is an essential contribution.\u201d Sharpe is part of a cohort of thinkers and artists \u2014 including Hartman, Arthur Jafa, Fred Moten, Simone Leigh, Garrett Bradley, Ja\u2019Tovia Gary, Lorraine O\u2019Grady and others \u2014 who are interrogating the rendering of Blackness in American culture and offering new ways of looking, seeing and being seen.",
      " Sharpe lays out an exploded view of the word \u201cwake.\u201d One definition is the disturbance a boat leaves behind as it moves through water. What would it mean to understand all of American life as still caught in the wake, still caught in the undertow of the ships that carried the enslaved? Sharpe also put forth the metaphors of the ship (the processes by which Black people are still seen as property), the hold (the ways that captivity and punishment are still central to Black life) and the weather (the ambient anti-Blackness that is as pervasive as climate).",
      "The word wake invokes the funereal, yet Sharpe also summons the celebratory nature of a wake, the ways Black people find \u201can insistence on existence\u201d through family, music, dance, community and art. This she calls \u201cwake work.\u201d Her aim is not to suffuse people with a sense of despair, she told me, but to galvanize them to \u201cturn our attention elsewhere.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t mourn and don\u2019t grieve,\u201d she told me, but rather to stop expecting redemption, validation and justice from white society and institutions.",
      "Sharpe never directly mentions the word \u201cwoke,\u201d an idiom that has been used as far back as the 1930s to mean readiness and watchfulness. In recent years, the word has been weaponized as a rallying cry against progressive ideas and policies. Its inevitable perversion is implied in the book\u2019s central premise. Woke is caught in the wake too, its fate a warning about just how powerful the churn behind those ships can be.",
      "Sharpe\u2019s latest book, ",
      " which was published in April, is her most liberating and poetic experiment yet. Made up of 248 individual notes, it is a deft blend of memoir, theory, archival documents and lyrical reflections on her daily life. It also includes Sharpe\u2019s photographs of moody skyscapes, images of flowers, family photographs, art installations and paintings.",
      "There is wonder (Note 133, marveling at a rare photograph of her mother and grandmother, leaning sweetly against each other, her mother\u2019s hands gracefully cupped, Sharpe asks, \u201cWhere did she learn that?\u201d); personal history (Note 195, on a nervous tic developed in graduate school of strangling herself when she spoke: \u201cSpeech and speechlessness; each one has a cost\u201d); cultural criticism (Note 27, after visiting the Legacy Museum in Alabama, which features a photo wall showcasing historical images of white violence: \u201cHow many more lookings?\u201d); meditations on archival work (Note 185, on collective memory: \u201cWe have to function as a living library; as an institution\u201d).",
      "The notes build in momentum and assemble themselves into a mosaic that holds the relentless terror of Black life as well as its undeniable beauty. \u201cI wanted them to have a certain kind of force and velocity and accumulation,\u201d she told me. By turning her gaze inward, Sharpe offers a framework for understanding how to move forward, even when burdened by all the knowledge of the world\u2019s cruelty. (Note 106: \u201cYou do not have to save the things that kill you.\u201d)",
      " class, Sharpe welcomed me into her home. It felt sturdy, like a farmhouse. A mantel held candles, flowers and artwork by a friend, the abstract painter ",
      ", who Sharpe says renders Blackness with \u201cbreath and air.\u201d She set out a lime green tray of fresh figs, bright orange clementines, crispy grapes and a fragrant tea served in delicate floral cups. The mantel and dining table were covered with fresh flowers: red tulips and scalloped pink ranunculus the size of baby cabbages. At the edge of my view, the tips of deciduous trees were patiently waiting out winter.",
      "Sharpe has lived in Toronto for the last five years, drawn in part by her partner, the poet ",
      ", who has lived there since she was 17. Brand was in Tobago for the winter, and Sharpe and I arranged ourselves around a coffee table covered in books by photographers and scholars working in the African diaspora, including ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      ". Her voice is soft and girlish except when she breaks into a full-throated laugh that takes over her whole body, her careful regality surrendering momentarily to spontaneous delight.",
      "Sharpe told me that the idea of \u201cOrdinary Notes\u201d came from a scene in \u201cBeloved\u201d depicting a character who tries to escape enslavement only to end up in a Georgia prison. Each morning and evening, another incarcerated man calls out a clear, high note signaling the start and end of their day. He is called Hi Man. Hi Man\u2019s offering are the notes of humanity amid grisly conditions of bone-breaking labor and sexual assault. To Sharpe, this \u201csounding of care\u201d is an offering of generosity and presence despite untenable circumstances, and it is enough to sustain the men until their eventual escape. Her book is a prismatic examination of all the notes in her own life \u2014 the ones that sound care and the ones that don\u2019t \u2014 and how knowing the difference offers a kind of sanity.",
      "\u201cHow to find the words and grammars we can live in?\u201d she asked, and paused. \u201cBecause we do live in them. How to keep working in the knowledge that we do make them and we do live in them?\u201d",
      "Sharpe gave me a tour of the artwork in her home, much of which is the byproduct of a collaboration. She is an art critic and has contributed to the monographs of some of the most important artists of our time, including ",
      " ",
      ", ",

      " and ",
      ". There was a drawing by Saar and a painting by ",
      ". A framed print called \u201cVanishing Act,\u201d by the artist ",
      ", caught my eye. In her first book, \u201cMonstrous Intimacies,\u201d Sharpe writes extensively on Walker\u2019s work to reveal how society is programmed to default to racist narratives. Sharpe and Walker are connected through their mutual desire to understand the \u201cdisfiguration of blackness and whiteness\u201d and the consequences of denying our shared complicity in the way the past still shapes the present.",
      "In Walker\u2019s print, a woman kneels before a rapt audience, devouring a small child. The title refers to a sleight of hand, a trick performed by a magician, but the vanishing in this image involves cannibalism. The setting \u2014 a stage \u2014 and their dated clothing \u2014 petticoats and stockings \u2014 recall minstrelsy. The hands of both figures, even the person being eaten, are relaxed, complicating the relationship between exploiter and exploited. The work in Sharpe\u2019s office, like many of Walker\u2019s famous prints and sculptures, is devoid of color. One could make assumptions about the figures and their respective races, but the only clues are drawn from historical characterizations of Black people (the older woman is wearing a head scarf). Over the last two decades, Walker has been attacked by critics for reproducing racist tropes, but that outrage is misdirected. It is the presuppositions that viewers bring to the work that are so repellent, not the figures themselves. In \u201cVanishing Act,\u201d it is impossible to tell who is the victor and who is the victim. Only their acceptance of what they\u2019re doing, and perhaps the pleasure they\u2019re taking in doing it, is truly legible.",
      "The more time I spend with Sharpe\u2019s work, the more it inflects my ways of seeing the world. According to Sharpe, Blackness is anagrammatical, meaning that the structures that order language, thought and society become disordered \u2014 if not destroyed entirely \u2014 when they encounter Blackness. \u201cHer work has shown that we, as Black people, are the foils of humanity,\u201d Frank B. Wilderson III, author of \u201cAfropessimism,\u201d told me. \u201cIf humanity defines itself against us, what does it mean for us to live every day as the anti-human?\u201d",

      " and Black models for free labor \u2014 the ship, the hold and the wake.",
      " Sharpe\u2019s parents, Ida Wright Sharpe and Van Buren Sharpe Jr., moved from West Philadelphia to Wayne, Pa. \u201cThey wanted what they both imagined and knew that they did not have,\u201d she writes. A home big enough for the family that would eventually grow to six children, a yard, access to good schools and proverbial opportunities. Her mother worked in a department store and her father was a mail sorter and chef. Sharpe was born in 1965. Her eldest sibling was almost 22 years her senior, and by the time her sibling who was closest in age went to college, she was 11. It was lonely. \u201cI mostly felt like an only child,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Ida, doted on her and gifted her \u201ca love of words,\u201d inscribing books to her daughter in her ornate script. Ida also gave her the gift of time to get lost in them. Sharpe read \u201cThe People Could Fly,\u201d \u201cSong of Solomon\u201d and \u201cLittle Women\u201d for hours, curled up in a roomy windowsill in the house. In the spring, she collected wild violets for her mother who used them to make jelly. In lieu of trips to the ballet or theater, Ida hosted Sunday salons where she served poundcake and tea, and mother and daughter read poetry to each other.",
      "An idea that reverberates in all of Sharpe\u2019s work is that you might be forced to live in subjugation but that does not mean only living life as a subjugated person. \u201cThat is what I always want to animate,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny the violence. But that\u2019s not the only way we encounter each other.\u201d Beauty, pleasure and the \u201cspace to dream\u201d (Note 51) were forces applied steadily to a young Sharpe, counteracting all that threatened to destabilize her self-worth. \u201cI marvel at my mother\u2019s commitment to joy,\u201d she told me. That joy made Sharpe possible. The final note in Ordinary Notes reads, \u201cThis is a love letter to my mother.\u201d",
      "But what happened inside the Sharpe home was one thing. What happened outside it was another. \u201cThings were not better in this \u2018new world,\u2019\u201d she writes. In person, she tells me that her experiences as a young girl in Wayne were \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "In \u201cOrdinary Notes,\u201d Sharpe recalls photographs of white terror \u2014 people screaming from the sidelines of a school and neighborhood integration, the Charlottesville tiki torches in 2017. They dredge up something dormant for her. \u201cHis face is an open-mouthed rictus of hatred,\u201d she writes in Note 5. \u201cI felt I knew it.\u201d The next note includes a heartbreakingly tender photograph of Sharpe as a little girl, hair in plaits, smile broad and unbroken, for the moment.",
      "\u201cIt was not a happy time,\u201d she said, falling silent.",
      "When she was almost 12, her father died. Money became scarce. Bills went unpaid, winters were spent without heat, repairs to the house went undone. Throughout, her mother cultivated beauty. Forsythia, cut from the yard, arranged in a vase, served as a welcome distraction from a ceiling that was falling down. Mustard greens, corn and tomatoes from the garden supplemented meals, and beautifully rolled logs made from paper were burned for heat. During Sharpe\u2019s first semester as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, her mother was unable to make a payment, and the school threatened to kick her out. That experience indelibly shaped her, but so did the teachers, many of them Black, she met during that time.",
      "Sharpe enrolled in the English Ph.D. program at Cornell University \u2014 \u201cso I\u2019d have the most time and space to think and learn\u201d \u2014 and planned to start an independent Black middle school in West Philadelphia.

      "In academia at that time, personal experience and knowledge were viewed as inauthentic forms of scholarship, and those who tried to incorporate these elements into their work were deterred. It was disparagingly called \u201cmesearch.\u201d \u201cI was trained as an academic; you don\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite everything we know about objectivity, we were not encouraged to include ourselves in particular ways.\u201d Still, she left her mark by advocating for more diverse teachers, pressing the university to bring in more Chicana, Asian and Native professors, which they did.",

During this time, her mother died. She fell into a deep depression. (Note 156: \u201cIt was as if I\u2019d lost my center of gravity.\u201d) She lay in bed so long she developed a sore. Once again, her mother intervened. She had given young Christina a book on North American birds, and turning her gaze skyward had become a passion. She returned to the hobby while mourning; looking up was a way out.",

      "invitation for a conference called Loophole of Retreat, scheduled for early October in Venice alongside the Biennale, began circulating online. The sculptor Simone Leigh, who represented the United States at the art fair, hosted the convening as part of her presentation (it was organized by the curator Rashida Bumbray), and Sharpe was among the more than 60 scholars and thinkers enlisted to share their work.",
      "Leigh, like Sharpe, is invested in the project of wresting back control of Black imagery from its historic (and continued) abuse without reproducing past terrors and trauma. The towering scale of her magisterial sculptures commands an indisputable authority rarely afforded to Black women. They \u2014 and she \u2014 author their own narratives; they validate their own importance.",
      "The conference took its name from a phrase that the writer Harriet Jacobs used in \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\u201d to describe the seven years she spent hiding in a crawl space that was so cramped it left her permanently disabled. Yet she still claimed the tiny attic as a site of independence, a place to dream and plot strategies for freedom until she could enact them. Italy is a complicated place to undertake practices of freedom, in part because of the routine deaths of African migrants who drown seeking refuge in the country. Participants in the conference invoked the connection between Jacobs\u2019s confinement and the modern-day horrors experienced regularly.",
      "One of the conference\u2019s themes was maroonage, referring to people who escaped slavery to build their own independent communities on the outskirts of society. For those three days, the tiny lush island off the coast of Venice where the convening took place became its own planet, accruing a powerful density anchored by hundreds of Black people, mostly women, who flew from all corners of the world to participate. Scholarly presentations lived alongside films about utopian Detroit and about Drexciya, a mythological aqueous society, and emotional readings about Black motherhood. The convening suggested that the potential for Black sovereignty was more than just an idea; it had already arrived.",
      "On the first day, Sharpe took the stage to read excerpts from \u201cOrdinary Notes\u201d inside a large, ornate hall, dressed in a blue striped tunic layered over a multicolored turtleneck. It was the first time many in attendance were getting a preview of the successor to \u201cIn the Wake,\u201d and the room crackled with anticipation.",
      "She read a series of notes about a photograph of her mother and a moving encounter with a man she witnessed kneeling on the ground on an earlier trip to Venice. Sharpe closed her reading with Note 175: \u201cTenderness might just be a gesture, it might just be a look, a Black look, some regard, relayed between people in peril.\u201d",
      "Care, as practiced by Sharpe, means small gestures that acknowledge one another\u2019s humanity. It means cultivating an awareness of the possibility of re-enacting violence even while trying to critique it. The time in Venice felt imbued with such care. It was a pause from the abjection that many of its attendees experience on a regular basis; a temporary space to practice methods of consideration, decadence and stillness. On those grounds, in this collection of moments, Sharpe\u2019s theories sharpened into focus. Freedom and love will never come from white society: They must be obtained by the self and also exchanged freely among ourselves.",
      "One note that has most stuck with me, Note 96, describes an interaction between Sharpe and a young woman who works in the cafe in the Tate Modern in London. Sharpe pauses to say hello. The greeting doesn\u2019t register. Sharpe tries again. Finally, the woman draws herself into the moment. She tells Sharpe that she has been working at the museum for months and no one had ever spoken to her beyond asking her to do something. She thanks her for \u201cseeing me and asking about me.\u201d Sharpe records the reminder of their interaction as follows:",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018I see you.\u2019",
      "She says, \u2018I know.\u2019",
      "I say, \u2018We see each other.\u2019",
      "She says, \u2018Yes. We do.\u2019\u201d",
      "(Note 181: \u201cRegard is a habit of care. It is appreciation and esteem. It is the right of repair.\u201d )",
      "If there\u2019s an argument at the center of \u201cOrdinary Notes,\u201d it is that attentiveness and imagination are powerful restorative agents capable of reconstituting what has been broken down and targeted for obliteration. I often think back to that time in Venice, suspended in motion, embodying survival and sustenance. I felt carried along by a great momentum, perhaps on another kind of vessel, powering us toward the beyond.",
      "Mickalene Thomas is an artist known for her paintings of African American women that combine historical, political and pop culture references. She uses photography often to examine complex notions of femininity while challenging common definitions of beauty and aesthetic representations of women in recontextualized interior settings."

      "When the former secretary of state and C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo, a man who had dealt firsthand with autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, described Randi Weingarten as \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d last November, it seemed as though he couldn\u2019t possibly be serious.",
      "Weingarten is 65 and just over five feet tall. She is Jewish and openly gay \u2014 she\u2019s married to a rabbi \u2014 and lives in Upper Manhattan. She is the longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, which is not even the country\u2019s biggest union of public-school educators. (The A.F.T. has 1.7 million members; the National Education Association has three million.) The A.F.T. did give in excess of $26 million to Democratic candidates and causes in the 2022 election cycle, but the Carpenters and Joiners union gave more than twice as much.",
      "Pompeo, whose remarks appeared in a widely quoted interview with the online news site Semafor, had nevertheless put his finger on something: The pandemic and the ongoing culture wars over race and gender had shifted America\u2019s educational landscape, and with it the political landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s not a close call,\u201d ",
      " \u201cIf you ask, \u2018Who\u2019s the most likely to take this republic down?\u2019 It would be the teachers\u2019 unions, and the filth that they\u2019re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don\u2019t know math and reading or writing.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans quickly piled on. Pompeo had set the bar high, and they needed to invoke equally hot rhetoric and florid imagery to ensure headlines of their own. \u201cBig labor unions have taken over public education,\u201d Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina told Fox News in late January. \u201cThat\u2019s bad for parents, bad for kids, bad for America.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida mounted his attack in The American Conservative magazine: \u201cOur schools are a cesspool of Marxist indoctrination. Dangerous academic constructs like critical race theory and radical gender theory are being forced on elementary school children.\u201d Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had already garnered national attention with his book bans, Florida\u2019s \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d and its so-called Don\u2019t Say Gay legislation, unveiled a new proposal designed to rein in \u201coverreaching teachers\u2019 unions,\u201d which a column on the Fox website enthusiastically embraced as \u201ca blueprint to dominate union bosses.\u201d ",

      " \u2014 known as the nation\u2019s report card \u2014 revealed the largest average score decline in reading since 1990 and the first average score decline in math since 1969.

Last fall, a Gallup poll found that the percentage of ",
      " to 42 percent, a 20-year low.",
      "This crisis has political consequences. The pandemic closures and classroom culture wars have fueled the revival of the dormant school-choice movement, with Republican-led states around the country passing an array of far-reaching ",
      ". These bills come in different forms but share a common goal: to enable parents to move their children out of America\u2019s government-run education system en masse. All of the prospective Republican presidential candidates for 2024 have committed to building on this growing movement, whose roots can be traced back more than 50 years, to the battle over desegregation. The same pandemic closures that demonstrated how central public schools are to the communities they serve also became the inciting event for an unprecedented effort to dismantle them.",
      "The public-education system may not be very popular right now, but both Democrats and Republicans tend to like their local schools and their children\u2019s teachers. The unions that represent those teachers, however, are more polarizing. One reason for this is that they are actively involved in partisan politics, and, more specifically, are closely aligned with the Democrats, a reality powerfully driven home during the pandemic. A study by Brown University\u2019s Annenberg Institute found that Democratic districts, with correspondingly ",
      " more slowly and gradually than Republican districts with weaker unions. In some ways, Randi Weingarten and the A.F.T. \u2014 the union \u201cboss\u201d and \u201cbig labor\u201d \u2014 are a logical, even inevitable target for the G.O.P.",
      "A frequent knock on the A.F.T. is that it puts teachers before students, a framing neatly encapsulated by a quote attributed to the union\u2019s former president Al Shanker: \u201cWhen schoolchildren start paying union dues, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll start representing the interests of schoolchildren.\u201d Shanker\u2019s biographer, Richard Kahlenberg, found no record of Shanker\u2019s ever saying this and doesn\u2019t think he ever did, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the union\u2019s critics from citing it. Weingarten has a rebuttal: Good working conditions for teachers make good learning conditions for students. But Weingarten does in fact represent teachers, not students. Often, such as when it comes to issues like classroom size or school budgets, their interests align. Sometimes they don\u2019t. ",
      "For a period during the pandemic, the two groups\u2019 apparent interests diverged, and a series of fault lines started opening across the country, separating not only Republicans from Democrats but also parents from teachers, centrist Democrats from progressives and urban Black parents from suburban white parents, and even dividing the teachers\u2019 union itself. These fault lines widened as the reopening debates merged into fights over how schools should deal with the teaching of the country\u2019s racial history as well as sexuality and gender identity.",
      "What became increasingly clear to me over the last several months, as I spoke to dozens of politicians, political consultants, union leaders, parent activists and education scholars about the convulsions in American education, is that it\u2019s no longer possible to separate education from politics, and that public schools are more vulnerable than they\u2019ve ever been. How did Randi Weingarten wind up at the center of the 2024 Republican primary? The only way to answer that question is to re-examine America\u2019s education wars and the competing political agendas that are driving them. \u201cOh, goodness, no! Not at all!\u201d Pompeo answered when I asked if he was, perhaps, being hyperbolic in his remarks about Weingarten. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Ms. Weingarten, but she has been the most visible face of the destruction of American education.\u201d",
      "early months of the pandemic, teachers were celebrated as essential workers, heroically continuing to serve America\u2019s children from their homes, often with limited resources and inadequate technology. But during the summer of 2020, things started to shift. There was already early research showing that students were suffering academically from remote learning. Schools across Europe had begun reopening without any major outbreaks, and many of America\u2019s private and parochial schools were making plans to resume in-person learning at the start of the new school year. A lot of public-school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom, too. But many teachers seemed resistant to the idea.",
      "Because of the decentralized structure of America\u2019s public-education system, which has some 14,000 different school districts, the federal government could not order schools to reopen for in-person learning, but in July 2020, President ",
      " from those that didn\u2019t. His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, echoed his sentiments, demanding that the nation\u2019s schools be \u201cfully operational\u201d by the fall without providing a specific plan for doing so.",
      "Many members of the A.F.T. remained worried about putting themselves, their families and their communities at risk. The A.F.T. had issued its ",
      " in late April, calling for adequate personal protective equipment, a temporary suspension of formal teacher performance evaluations, a limit on student testing, a cancellation of student-loan debt and a $750 billion federal aid package to help schools prepare to reopen safely and facilitate \u201ca real recovery for all our communities.\u201d Weingarten did not believe the Trump administration was giving schools what teachers needed to return to work safely. She publicly denounced Trump and DeVos\u2019s call to reopen as \u201creckless,\u201d \u201ccallous\u201d and \u201ccruel,\u201d and the A.F.T. passed a resolution supporting local strikes if schools were forced to reopen in areas where a variety of safety conditions hadn\u2019t been met. As if to underscore the point, some ",
      "Florida became a test case. Even as the state\u2019s Covid death rate was surging in July, its Department of Education issued an emergency order requiring schools to fully reopen in August. The state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, the Florida Education Association, affiliated with both the A.F.T. and the N.E.A., sued DeSantis and his education commissioner, Richard Corcoran, among others, to block the reopenings, arguing that the order violated the state\u2019s Constitution, which guarantees Florida residents the right to \u201csafe\u201d and \u201csecure\u201d public schools. At a virtual news conference announcing the lawsuit, Weingarten accused DeSantis of being in \u201cintense denial.\u201d After some Florida schools started reopening, an A.F.T. political action committee produced a ",
      " citing claims that schools were becoming superspreader sites and that children were being used as \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d ",
      "As the lawsuit was working its way through the legal system \u2014 the union won in the lower court but lost on appeal \u2014 Florida was holding its biannual school-board elections, and the prospective return to in-person learning became the defining issue in many races. In Brevard County, Tina Descovich, the incumbent, was in favor of an immediate return to the classroom and opposed mask mandates. She was challenged by a public-school speech-language pathologist, Jennifer Jenkins, who called for a more cautious approach, including a mask mandate for all but the youngest children. ",
      "Jenkins easily won the late-August election, but Descovich was just getting started. She called Tiffany Justice, a fellow school-board member in nearby Indian River County, to suggest that they create their own parents\u2019 rights group, Moms for Liberty. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something here,\u201d Justice recalled Descovich\u2019s telling her. \u201cWe have to help these parents because they\u2019re trying to step up and speak out, and the schools are just slamming them at every turn.\u201d",
      "Other parents across the political spectrum started organizing, too. Many public schools hadn\u2019t fully reopened for the start of the new school year, and they were frustrated. They wrote op-eds, held rallies or met via Zoom with school-board members and other elected officials, often finding themselves at odds with local teachers\u2019 unions and union-backed school-board members. The first fault lines had started to open.",
      "the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement had prompted a national reckoning over race, as well as an ensuing backlash. The politics of the pandemic had begun to merge with the culture wars, and both were playing out most vividly in the American classroom. An esoteric academic term \u2014 critical race theory, or C.R.T. \u2014 had improbably become the rallying cry for a conservative campaign focused on the teaching of the nation\u2019s racial history. President Trump, running for re-election, eagerly took up the cause, blaming \u201cdecades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools\u201d for the Black Lives Matter protests and urging America\u2019s parents to fight back against efforts to teach their children \u201chateful lies about this country.\u201d",

The Chicago Teachers Union took to the streets to demand that the city\u2019s board of education cancel a $33 million contract between Chicago\u2019s public schools and its Police Department for the safety officers who staff the city\u2019s public schools. United Teachers Los Angeles helped lead a successful fight to press its school district to slash its police budget by $25 million and use the money instead to hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers.",
      "That October, Weingarten embarked on a cross-country bus tour to get out the vote for Joe Biden. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, had not always been in sync with the A.F.T.; the union opposed elements of Obama\u2019s Race to the Top program, which sent money to states that reformed their public-education systems by, among other things, weakening teacher tenure, introducing data-driven accountability measures and adding more nonunionized charter schools. Biden, by contrast, vowed to focus on neighborhood public schools rather than charters and criticized the standardized-testing regimes and teacher evaluations that were a hallmark of Race to the Top. Weingarten\u2019s name was even floated as a candidate for secretary of education. She didn\u2019t get the job, but she and the head of the N.E.A., Becky Pringle, were invited to the White House on the day after Biden\u2019s inauguration. The teachers\u2019 unions finally had a true ally in the Oval Office. The first lady, Jill Biden, taught at a public community college herself. (",
      " President Biden would later quip.) The new administration gave teachers preferential access to the Covid vaccine, behind some other essential workers but ahead of the general population. Biden had pledged to quickly reopen America\u2019s schools, and the A.F.T. was communicating with top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about its guidelines for doing so, suggesting that the agency add a provision allowing for its recommendations to be revisited if a highly contagious Covid variant emerged. But the anger that had been unleashed by the pandemic closures and the culture wars had not abated.",
      "Justice and Descovich, the former Florida school-board members, incorporated Moms for Liberty in early 2021 with a far more ambitious and political agenda than simply advocating a return to maskless, in-person classes. As the group\u2019s mission statement explained, it was \u201cdedicated to fighting for the survival of America by unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.\u201d The group built its brand with bumper magnets and T-shirts emblazoned with the motto \u201cWe Do NOT Co-Parent With the Government.\u201d It was embraced by the right-wing media and then by donors eager to turn it into a national movement, while nurturing its grass-roots image, mirroring the model created by the Tea Party, the quasi-populist uprising fueled by conservative billionaires and Fox News. The former Fox host Megyn Kelly headlined a fund-raising event in Florida, speaking about, as Justice recalled, \u201cthe woke ideology\u201d coming out of America\u2019s classrooms. Moms for Liberty soon expanded beyond Florida. That summer, a chapter in Tennessee presented an 11-page ",

(A state law barring governors from serving consecutive terms prevented him from running for re-election.)",
      "Biden had beaten Trump by 10 points in Virginia, and McAuliffe led in the early polls. But Virginia\u2019s schools had been among the last on the East Coast to fully reopen, and the lingering bitterness from these pandemic closures had formed a politically combustible mix with the rising culture wars.

Instead, McAuliffe stood by his comment, saying that states and local school boards should have authority over what\u2019s taught in schools.",

McAuliffe\u2019s quote became the centerpiece of a rolling series of ads accusing him of going \u201con the attack against parents.\u201d A longtime critic of organized labor, Youngkin also sought to drive a wedge between teachers and their unions, promising to devote at least $100 million to raise teacher salaries while at the same time saying that McAuliffe would bow to his special-interest allies rather than doing what\u2019s best for children.",
      "A vast majority of Virginia\u2019s teachers belong to the N.E.A., which tends to cover more rural areas, not the A.F.T., whose members are generally concentrated in big cities. But Weingarten was friendly with McAuliffe from the Clinton days and was supporting his candidacy on Twitter and cable news, and the A.F.T. was helping him develop his education platform. Weingarten told me that she called McAuliffe after the debate to tell him that he was wrong \u2014 that parents should have a role in their children\u2019s education. \u201cTerry made a very bad mistake, which Youngkin capitalized on,\u201d she said. (Through a spokesman, McAuliffe said that he talked to Weingarten regularly during the campaign but has no recollection of her criticizing his remark.)",
      "By the fall of 2021, America\u2019s public schools were fully open, but mask mandates were still being hotly contested. Weingarten had been working to try to rebuild trust between some families and their schools. In late September, just a couple of days after the McAuliffe debate, she held a virtual town hall on mask mandates with Open Schools USA, an anti-masking right-wing parents\u2019 rights group that was rallying families to pull their children out of public schools, in an effort to foster open dialogue with the union\u2019s critics.",
      "Under Weingarten, who was elected president of the A.F.T. in 2008, the national union has gone all in on electoral politics, significantly increasing its political spending in the belief that the best way to serve its rank and file is by electing Democrats. The A.F.T. gave more than $1 million to McAuliffe, and Weingarten even knocked on doors for him in Alexandria. But Youngkin had the momentum in the final weeks of the race. His candidacy received another boost in October when Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the F.B.I. to help address the rising threats of violence toward some school-board members. The order stemmed from a letter written to the Biden administration by the National School Boards Association, asking that federal law enforcement address threats against public school officials that \u201ccould be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism.\u201d But Republican lawmakers and the right-wing media seized on the language in the letter to ",

She was eager to be on hand for the final push, and her staff asked for her to be given a speaking role at the rally. Because she had been such a generous and loyal supporter of McAuliffe\u2019s, the campaign didn\u2019t want to say no, even though some Democrats worried that they could be handing Youngkin another gift.",
      "Politically speaking, Weingarten played perfectly into Youngkin\u2019s Parents Matter campaign. That spring, a right-wing watchdog group, Americans for Public Trust, had gotten hold of email communications between top officials at the A.F.T. and the C.D.C. about the agency\u2019s school-reopening guidelines through the Freedom of Information Act and had passed them on to The New York Post. The tabloid, which had been gleefully attacking Weingarten for years \u2014 dubbing her Whine-garten \u2014 trumpeted the story: ",
      " The rest of the right-wing media and numerous Republican officials instantly jumped on the narrative. Senator Susan Collins of Maine grilled the C.D.C.\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, at a committee hearing over what she called the C.D.C.\u2019s \u201csecret negotiations\u201d with the teachers\u2019 union. Weingarten told me that the C.D.C. had solicited the A.F.T.\u2019s input and that the union hadn\u2019t suggested anything that the agency wasn\u2019t already considering incorporating into its guidelines. But the appearance of a partisan union leader who had privately discussed the future of the nation\u2019s schools with a government agency could be counterproductive in Virginia\u2019s charged political climate.",
      "Youngkin\u2019s staff was giddy at the prospect. \u201cI wanted to send them a gift basket,\u201d Kristin Davison, another senior Youngkin strategist, told me. \u201cIt was almost as good as when Stacey Abrams came.\u201d Republican elected officials around the country took potshots at their emerging villain. \u201cThe union boss responsible for shutting down schools is the final surrogate for Terry McAuliffe\u2019s failing campaign,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote on Twitter. \u201cVirginians should vote accordingly!\u201d",

      "may be too progressive, but to some members of her own union, she is not progressive enough. As the pandemic dragged on, she found herself caught between the wishes of the Democratic establishment she did not want to alienate and the left-leaning rank and file she represented. In Chicago, this tension came down, in early 2022, to the most elemental question for unions: whether or not to strike.",
      "At the time, the new Omicron variant was surging, and Illinois was experiencing a record number of Covid cases and hospitalizations. The A.F.T.\u2019s left-wing local, the Chicago Teachers Union, was concerned about sending its 25,000 members back to the classroom after winter break. The union was hearing similar worries from the Black families whose children make up a large percentage of the 320,000 students in Chicago\u2019s public schools. Many white suburban and exurban parents had been desperate to see their children return to the classroom and were now committed to keeping them there; but many urban Black parents \u2014 who tended to live in smaller homes with more family members, had generally lower vaccination rates and had lost more loved ones to the pandemic \u2014 had been and remained wary, especially with a new variant spiking.",
      "The union demanded mandatory testing for all teachers and students or a temporary return to remote learning. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, balked. President Biden and other prominent Democrats had been unambiguous about their desire for the ",
      " And the recent governor\u2019s election in Virginia had underscored the political danger of introducing more disruptions to in-person learning, especially with the 2022 midterms just around the corner. For Weingarten and the national union, a strike in the country\u2019s third-largest school system would obviously be politically costly.",
      "The insurgent group that leads the C.T.U. first came together in 2008, when the bipartisan education-reform movement was sweeping across the country, dividing the Democratic Party. Centrist billionaires and centrist Democrats joined forces to lead the effort to introduce more testing, accountability and free-market competition to the public schools. But the more progressive wing of the party viewed these measures as an attack on the very institution of public education, unleashing the forces of capitalism on what is supposed to be a public good.",
      "In Chicago, the reform efforts were led by Arne Duncan, the chief executive of the city\u2019s public-school district and President Obama\u2019s future education secretary. \u201cNeoliberal education reform hit Chicago like a ton of bricks,\u201d Jesse Sharkey, a high school history teacher, told me. Sharkey was a leader of this insurgency and would go on to become president of the C.T.U. from 2018 to 2022. \u201cYou\u2019d flip on the TV or pick up a newspaper, and you couldn\u2019t avoid hearing our so-called leaders trashing our schools, talking about their culture of failure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an environment that was downright hostile to public education.\u201d",
      "Sharkey and his fellow insurgents didn\u2019t believe the national union was fighting aggressively enough against these Democratic reformers. Tapping into Chicago\u2019s long history of community-based organizing, they built their own grass-roots movement within the union called the Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators, or CORE. Led by Karen Lewis, a chemistry teacher and union activist, CORE challenged the C.T.U.\u2019s incumbent leadership in 2010 and won control of the Chicago union. Two years later, after the city\u2019s new Democratic mayor, President Obama\u2019s former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, embarked on an ambitious program to close public schools and replace them with charters, the C.T.U. called ",
      " in 25 years. While the C.T.U. was voting on the strike authorization, Weingarten arrived in Chicago to appear on a panel with Emanuel at a conference hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative. It was a stunning turn of events that spoke to the tension between the A.F.T. and its left wing. For the political health of the union, Weingarten felt she needed to preserve her relationships with the country\u2019s most powerful Democratic leaders, many of whom, like Emanuel, were centrist reformers.",
      "As the 2012 strike wore on, Emanuel tried to turn the city against the teachers, accusing them of using ",
      " and unsuccessfully sought a court order to force them to return to work. After seven days, the city backed down; the union won major concessions, including a 16 percent raise over four years and the right for teachers who were laid off as part of Emanuel\u2019s ongoing school closures to be given priority for positions at other schools. The strike instantly became a galvanizing event for the union\u2019s more progressive members. Not only does CORE still control the C.T.U., but like-minded left-wing slates have since taken control of A.F.T. locals in several other cities, too, including Los Angeles and Baltimore.",
      "These insurgent caucuses are unified by what they call \u201csocial justice unionism.\u201d They see public schools\u2019 ongoing struggles to educate their students as inseparable from the larger societal and economic issues facing their working-class members and the poor communities whose children dominate their classrooms. \u201cWe are trying to promote a brand of unionism that goes all out in its fight for educational justice and is brave about taking on conflicts,\u201d Sharkey says. \u201cIn some ways, we\u2019re less careful about who we piss off nationally.\u201d",
      "There is a natural tension between these insurgent movements and the more establishment-oriented national union. In 2015, some rank-and-file members protested the A.F.T.\u2019s decision to issue an early endorsement of Hillary Clinton, to whom Weingarten is close, who was running against the pro-labor Bernie Sanders. But the tension is about more than just politics; it also goes to the heart of the A.F.T.\u2019s identity. To these caucuses, the union\u2019s power comes from the collective strength of its members \u2014 from the bottom up \u2014 which can conflict with the top-down leadership style of Weingarten, who has cultivated a distinct public profile, sometimes characterized by her own tendency toward political hyperbole. An impulsive user of Twitter, she has been known to send out the occasional overheated message. During the pandemic, when DeSantis supporters were selling \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci My Florida\u201d merchandise, including beer koozies, on the G.O.P.\u2019s WinRed website, she wrote: \u201cDisgusting. Millions of Floridians are going to ",
      "\u201d She later apologized for the tweet. ",
      "Two days after returning from winter break in January 2022, with their demands still unmet, the C.T.U. called a strike. \u201cThe union isn\u2019t stupid,\u201d Sharkey, who was president at the time, told me. \u201cWe knew people were sick of the pandemic.\u201d But, he went on, \u201cfor better or for worse we\u2019re a union that strikes. We didn\u2019t think it would be an easy or strategically wise thing, but there was a principle around it. It was something we had to do.\u201d",
      "The union already had a contentious relationship with Lightfoot, dating back to an 11-day strike over wages and class sizes in 2019 that ended with the city making major concessions. This time, though, the mayor had public opinion on her side, and she leveraged it in a flurry of media interviews, accusing the C.T.U. of holding Chicago\u2019s children \u201chostage.\u201d Lightfoot had long seen the A.F.T.\u2019s local as a \u201cpolitical movement\u201d whose ambitions extended well beyond protecting the rights of its workers. \u201cI think, ultimately, they\u2019d like to take over ",
      " but take over running the city government,\u201d she told The Times in 2021.",
      "The 2022 strike quickly became a political nightmare for national Democrats: A Democratic mayor was at war with a Democratic union, shutting down Chicago\u2019s schools at a moment when children were finally back in the classroom and the country was just beginning to confront the learning loss and emotional trauma caused by the pandemic. Splinter groups of teachers in Northern California were also planning sickouts in the face of the Omicron surge. The Chicago strike put Weingarten in a difficult position. Publicly, she supported the C.T.U., while also saying that children needed to be in the classroom. Behind the scenes, she was calling and texting Sharkey constantly, offering to do anything she could \u2014 even arrange a call with people at the White House \u2014 to help press Lightfoot and end the strike. After a few days, under intensifying public pressure, the C.T.U.\u2019s members voted to return to work. They had lost this battle, but they already had their sights on a bigger one: the city\u2019s upcoming mayoral election.",
      " before the 2022 midterms, the results from the first full National Assessment of Educational Progress since the start of the pandemic were released, revealing that 40 percent of the country\u2019s eighth-grade public-school students were not proficient in math, and 32 percent were not proficient in reading. The strikingly low scores instantly became a G.O.P. talking point: The culprit wasn\u2019t the pandemic, schools or teachers but the unions and Democratic politicians beholden to them. \u201cWe cannot let the nation forget how teachers\u2019 unions tried to hold our children\u2019s futures for ransom,\u201d said Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, then the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \u201cThese union bosses, and the politicians who enabled them, must be held accountable.\u201d Republicans up and down the ballot accused their Democratic opponents of carrying water for the teachers\u2019 unions.

Many Republican candidates pledged their allegiance to a \u201cParents\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u201d requiring schools to provide information on reading lists, curriculums and whether a family\u2019s child used another name or pronoun in school.",
      "The A.F.T. spent in excess of $20 million in the 2022 midterms, more than it ever had in an off-year election, and Weingarten campaigned tirelessly with high-profile Democrats around the country, her arrival on the stump invariably inspiring glee among local Republican leaders. When she appeared in Michigan with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, one G.O.P. pundit, Kaylee McGhee White, described her on Fox Business Network as \u201cthe kiss of death.\u201d Whitmer won easily, as did many other Democrats whose opponents had railed against drag-queen shows for children or L.G.B.T.Q.-themed books in school libraries. But Republican candidates who campaigned on another education issue \u2014 school choice \u2014 fared much better.",
      "As a political matter, all the education battles that had erupted since the start of the pandemic \u2014 over school closures, over how the country\u2019s racial history should be taught, over what sort of role parents ought to have in the classroom \u2014 were really about the same thing: whether America\u2019s children should continue to be educated in government-run public schools. Did the pandemic and the culture wars reveal the indispensability of these schools to their communities and to the broader fabric of the nation, or did they only underscore their inherent limitations \u2014 in effect, making the case for school choice?",
      "It was the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman who first proposed the modern concept of school vouchers in a paper in 1955. Friedman was a champion of free markets, and his idea was to leverage the transformative power of capitalism to prod schools to compete for families\u2019 dollars. But vouchers served another purpose too. The Supreme Court had just ruled on Brown v. Board of Education, and many white Americans were worried about the looming prospect of being forced to send their children to desegregated schools. ",
      ", writing, \u201cUnder such a system, there can develop exclusively white schools, exclusively colored schools and mixed schools.\u201d",
      "Thirty years later, with Friedman serving as an economic adviser, President Reagan tried repeatedly to introduce federal school-voucher legislation. One of his most vocal opponents was Al Shanker, then the A.F.T.\u2019s president, who argued that choice might be the point of \u201cshopping malls,\u201d but it was not the point of education, nor was it the reason taxpayers were expected to fund the nation\u2019s public schools: \u201cWe do so not to satisfy the individual wants of parents and students but because of the public interest in producing an educated citizenry capable of exercising the rights of liberty and being productive members of society.\u201d",
      "Even Congress, where Republicans held the Senate majority, considered Reagan\u2019s voucher proposals too radical. But the concept endured. In the 1990s, vouchers were championed by Christian conservatives like Paul Weyrich, a founder of the Heritage Foundation and mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas. Weyrich believed that the nation\u2019s public schools had become \u201cmorally decadent institutions\u201d and argued that the only answer was for Christians to educate their children themselves, ideally with government money. Over the years, some states experimented with limited voucher programs, typically designed to target discrete populations like children with special needs. But the pandemic created an opening for voucher advocates to think more ambitiously and move more aggressively. In fact, this had been the plan almost from the very beginning. Two months into the school closures, in the spring of 2020, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Catholic archbishop of New York, asked DeVos \u2014 then the education secretary and a longtime supporter of school choice \u2014 in an interview on SiriusXM radio if she intended to \u201cutilize this particular crisis to ensure that justice is finally done to our kids and the parents who choose to send them to faith-based schools.\u201d ",
      ": \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d",
      "In 2021, at least 18 states created new school-choice programs or expanded existing ones, and more followed suit in 2022. Some of these new programs represent a significant departure from those of the past. Known collectively as universal voucher programs, they are available to everyone and can be applied toward any kind of school. The goal is not merely to disrupt public education but to defund and dismantle it. For years, the country\u2019s lower courts largely agreed that spending taxpayer money on religious schools was unconstitutional. But last summer, the Supreme Court created a new precedent, ruling that it was in fact ",

      " religious schools.",
      "DeVos, now back in the private sector, is one of the leading funders of this new national voucher campaign, primarily through an organization that she helped found called the American Federation for Children. The group and its affiliates spent $9 million on school-choice campaigns in 2022, at least $2.5 million of which came directly from DeVos and her husband. They spent much of this money in the primaries, turning support for school choice into a litmus test and targeting Republican incumbents opposed to it. Three-quarters of the candidates they supported won. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a red wave or a blue wave in the midterms, but there was a school-choice wave,\u201d Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at the American Federation for Children, wrote to me in an email. Echoing Weyrich\u2019s sentiments about the moral decadence of American public education, DeAngelis quoted Voddie Baucham, a Christian home-schooling advocate: \u201cWe cannot continue to send our children to Caesar for their education and be surprised when they come home as Romans.\u201d",
      "DeAngelis identified Weingarten as a useful political foil long before Mike Pompeo. He has been trolling her relentlessly on Twitter since 2021, ostentatiously thanking her for starting \u201cthe school choice revolution.\u201d In March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, he posed with a life-size cardboard cutout of her clutching an award labeled \u201cThreat to America\u2019s Children,\u201d his left thumb raised in approval.",

In February, Brandon Johnson, a former middle-school teacher and paid union organizer, challenged her in the city\u2019s mayoral election. It was a long shot \u2014 one early poll put his support at 3 percent \u2014 but for the C.T.U., the Johnson campaign was a natural progression. To pursue their broader agenda, which reaches beyond education into areas like housing and policing, they needed the kind of power that can come only from winning partisan political elections. And they had both a powerful grass-roots movement and a source of campaign funds, in the form of members\u2019 dues, that could be leveraged to support Johnson\u2019s candidacy.",
      "Johnson\u2019s campaign was underwritten largely by the teachers\u2019 unions. Though the A.F.T. and the C.T.U. had their differences in the past, they have become more closely aligned in recent years. While there are still some divisions within the Democratic Party over education policy, the bipartisan education-reform movement that once posed such a formidable existential threat to the A.F.T. is a shadow of its former self. The threat to the A.F.T. is now partisan, which means that Weingarten is no longer facing as much pressure from centrist Democrats. Backed by the financial and organizational muscle of the national and local teachers\u2019 unions, Johnson knocked Lightfoot out of the two-person runoff, making her the first incumbent mayor in Chicago to be unseated after a single term in 40 years.",

In 2009, he said he was \u201cmore of a Republican than a Democrat.\u201d He was supported by the local business community and endorsed by the city\u2019s police union.

      "Bridgeport was once unavoidable. In the middle of the last century, the waterfront Fairfield County city 60 miles from Manhattan churned out so many kinds of products, it seemed to be almost single-handedly shaping the habits of modern life. Rolling off the assembly lines there: lipstick cases, flashlights, typewriters, fans, underwear, sewing machines, cars, scissors, guns, lace, drills, helicopters and phonograph records.",
      "But some people are only familiar with the aftermath: crumbling factories languishing along major roads and railways, an inescapable reminder of a painful loss.",
      "\u201cI told my wife, \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of Bridgeport. It\u2019s too rundown,\u2019\u201d said Andy Toledo, 43. It didn\u2019t help that a favorite TV show of his, \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d mocked the city as a place of \u201cwild dogs and gas stations without pumps.\u201d",
      "But in 2021, when Mr. Toledo and his family sought to relocate to Connecticut from their cramped condo in Mott Haven, in the Bronx, they found places like Easton and Milford too pricey, driven up by the pandemic buying spree. And Mr. Toledo soon realized that parts of Bridgeport \u2014 Connecticut\u2019s largest city, with about 148,000 residents \u2014 felt revitalized, including the North End near the Trumbull border, where the Toledos bought a new three-bedroom house in December 2021 for $390,000. Mr. Toledo shares the home with his wife, Yariliz Marquez-Toledo, 42, who works remotely for a Manhattan health clinic, and their 15-year-old son (another son is in college in Boston).",
      "Even gritty areas appear to be on the mend, although the process is happening in fits and starts. Apartments, breweries and antiques shops have popped up in some of the industrial hulks. Long-empty lots that resemble prairies are being eyed as sites for housing. And a two-year-old concert venue known as the Amp has added bounce to the city\u2019s nightlife.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is reminiscent of what happened in Mott Haven,\u201d as developers try to remake a depressed area, said Mr. Toledo, who recently left his job in New York City government to work at Bridgeport City Hall and help with the comeback. \u201cThe city\u2019s turning itself around.\u201d",
      "Making peace with the old stigma often allows buyers to find a home that feels hidden in plain sight. For two decades, Janine Sjonvall, a database manager, lived a few miles away in Fairfield. Apart from occasional trips to Bridgeport for minor-league baseball games or pizza, she didn\u2019t give it much thought. It took an online house search for her to discover what was just around the corner: an upscale Bridgeport neighborhood called Black Rock, where homes are cheaper than in Fairfield, even if property taxes are higher.",
      "A three-bedroom Dutch colonial-style house there, which cost $378,000 in 2020, is her home today. \u201cIt seems everybody is moving farther out of New York; people who used to buy in Norwalk are in Stratford,\u201d said Ms. Sjonvall, 54. \u201cI just stumbled upon this place, but I\u2019m pleased.\u201d",
      "Of course, development often leads to gentrification, which can encourage landlords to evict tenants and replace them with higher-paying ones. Already, some longtime residents are moving out, said Callie Gale Heilmann, a Bridgeport resident and a founder of the advocacy group Bridgeport Generation Now.",
      "City officials seem unwilling to attach strings to force developers to incorporate affordable housing in their projects: \u201cWe do need to grow our tax base, which has remained flat for years,\u201d Ms. Heilmann said. \u201cBut we have to ask ourselves: Who is the city for? Is it for people who have lived here their whole lives?\u201d",
      "Despite Bridgeport\u2019s large population, the 15-square-mile city is small among Connecticut\u2019s municipalities. The home lots are tiny, too, making the place feel dense.",
      "But the city is mostly houses, many in the Cape Cod-style popular around World War II, when Bridgeport was humming. The Brooklawn neighborhood comprises Capes and older colonials, and Arcadia and Hughes Avenues there are part of a well-kept pocket by the Rooster River. The tall, well-maintained 1960s condo towers along upper Park Avenue are an exception; they wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Miami Beach.",
      "In the South End, aged multifamily houses sit near former factories and student housing for the University of Bridgeport. Seaside Village, a co-op with shutter-lined brick homes built during World War I for workers at munitions factories, seems ageless.",
      "Black Rock has a similar co-op, the 36-building landmark Black Rock Gardens, on Fairfield Avenue. But Tudors, Mediterranean-style and modern homes, some quite large, are more common in this set-apart area, which residents prize for its walkability, next to Long Island Sound.",
      "On the East Side, rambling Italianates in pastel hues and showy Second Empires hug the streets around Washington Park, the onetime command central for mill owners. Citywide, more than a dozen buildings or districts are on the National Register of Historic Places.",
      "Since its industrial heyday, when Hungarians, Italians, Portuguese and immigrants from many other countries poured into the factory yards, Bridgeport has been a hub for newcomers, including a surge in the 1950s of Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Today, according to census figures, the racial makeup is 42 percent Latino, 35 percent Black, 18 percent white and 5 percent Asian.",
      "In the last five years, more than 1,500 apartments have been completed, are under construction or planned, in new and converted buildings that are mostly downtown, according to the Bridgeport Building Department. A three-building complex next to Interstate 95, in a former gramophone record factory on Cherry Street and Howard Avenue that had been abandoned for decades, is completed and occupied, with 174 apartments, market-rate and affordable.",
      "At a 104-unit brick complex at Main and Golden Hill Streets, called 1188 Lofts, the lights are now on in what had been boarded-up windows. Market-rate studios there start at $1,630 a month, and one-bedrooms at $1,865.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been sort of a diamond in the rough, but we\u2019re getting discovered,\u201d said John Guedes, the president of Primrose Companies, a developer about to cut a ribbon on a former Holiday Inn at 1070 Main Street going from 267 rooms to 94 apartments. Units will come furnished with the hotel\u2019s furniture, and one-bedrooms will start at $2,500 a month.",
      "Mr. Guedes is also constructing a 92-unit building at 1269 Main, a $22 million project, and is planning to add 112 units to an office building at 855 Main. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have affordable housing in these downtowns,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause nobody will spend money at night and they will become ghost towns.\u201d",
      "In late January, there were 78 single-family homes for sale in Bridgeport, at an average list price of $510,000, according to data from Antonio Coelho, an agent with William Pitt Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.",
      "At the high end was a five-bedroom house in Black Rock listed for $1.35 million; the least expensive was a two-bedroom in foreclosure in the Hollow neighborhood, for $156,000.",
      "There were also 41 multifamily homes listed for sale, at an average price of $442,000, Mr. Coelho said. And 26 condos were available for an average of $194,000.",
      "Deal activity appears to have come back to earth after a pandemic surge, brokers say. In 2022, 666 single-family homes sold, down from 716 in 2019, according to Sotheby\u2019s, although prices remain elevated, suggesting that demand remains robust. The 2022 average sale price was $326,000 \u2014 more than 50 percent higher than 2019\u2019s average of $210,000.",
      "\u201cIn the last couple years, Bridgeport has really gone nuts,\u201d said Mr. Coelho, who emigrated from Portugal to the Hollow in 1970 when he was 12, although he lives in nearby Shelton today. \u201cIt was little rough here in the \u201970s, but there are so many positive things going on now.\u201d",
      "Although often criticized for its crime, Bridgeport\u2019s rates appear on a par with those of other comparable cities. In 2019, there were 2,506 major crimes, including assaults, robberies and car thefts, and 17 murders, according to police statistics. In 2022, by comparison, there were 1,729 major crimes, including 15 murders, suggesting that the pandemic spike has ebbed.",
      "The poverty rate is 23 percent, below New Haven\u2019s (25 percent) and Hartford\u2019s (28 percent), but higher than Stamford\u2019s (9 percent), according to the census.",
      "Frederick Law Olmsted, known as a designer of Central Park, worked his magic on two green spaces in Bridgeport: 181-acre Beardsley Park, which contains the state\u2019s only zoo, and 375-acre Seaside Park, which offers a gentle crescent of sand. A statue of P.T. Barnum, resident, mayor and circus legend, surveys the waves with a serious expression.",
      "Boldly offbeat community radio station WPKN entertains at all hours, while Fairfield Avenue in Black Rock bustles at night. In January, Park City Music Hall hosted a Van Halen tribute band and an act called Beatniks Organ Trio. Total Mortgage Arena offers hockey games and concerts, and the Amp next door \u2014 officially, the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater, a 5,700-seat conversion of a former baseball stadium \u2014 hosts bands.",
      "Steelpointe, a waterfront project planned for years, doesn\u2019t have a lot to show for itself yet, but the lighthouse-themed restaurant Boca Mediterranean Oyster Bar offers marina views.",
      "And Mongers Market, which sells items salvaged from factories inside a former screwdriver and piano factory, has been pulling in large crowds for the last few years.",
      "Bridgeport\u2019s school district, which had 39 schools and programs for about 19,000 students in the 2021-22 school year, has not been among the state\u2019s best, but perhaps is not as troubled as some think.",
      "On the state\u2019s 2022 Smarter Balanced assessment exams, given to students in third through eighth grade, 60.5 percent met standards in English, compared with 60.4 percent statewide, and 57 percent met standards in math, compared with 65 percent statewide. (Stamford, a nearby city with a 16,000-student district, didn\u2019t fare much differently: 57 percent of students met standards in English and 58 percent met standards in math.)",
      "Overall, 65 percent of Bridgeport\u2019s students are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, while the statewide figure is 41 percent. Bridgeport\u2019s six high schools have a four-year graduation rate of 76 percent, versus Connecticut\u2019s 90 percent overall rate.",
      "School officials say Bridgeport\u2019s system is chronically underfunded. Last year, spending there was $16,439 a student; in contrast, Stamford spent $19,625, according to state data.",
      "Bridgeport has a major stop on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven train line, from which 10 trains depart for Grand Central on weekdays between 6 and 8 a.m. The shortest trip takes an hour and 21 minutes; the longest takes an hour and 45 minutes. A monthly pass is about $384. The stop, downtown on Water Street, also offers Amtrak service.",
      "The Greater Bridgeport Transit bus system also offers service along more than a dozen routes within the city and beyond it.",
      "Bridgeport has enjoyed ferry service to Long Island since 1872, when crops were hauled to the city\u2019s factories. In the winter, boats carrying cars depart 10 times a day for Port Jefferson, a trip that takes an hour and 15 minutes. The fee for most vehicles is $68.",
      "Employees of a major pie bakery on Kossuth Street once passed the time in the parking lot by throwing empty pie tins back and forth. The pastime, at William Frisbie\u2019s bakery, soon became a hit with local children, according to the ",
      " at the Bridgeport Public Library, and the children turned it into a sport. Yalies in New Haven followed suit, calling the game \u201cFrisbie.\u201d In the 1950s, Wham-O, a California company, made plastic versions of the tins and tweaked the name slightly, producing the Frisbee.",

      "When Stephen Foglia and his fianc\u00e9e, JoAnne Crimeni, decided it was time to leave Brooklyn and put down roots, they headed south to New Jersey. Traveling through a number of areas they couldn\u2019t afford, they came upon Freehold Township, a place they knew only from having been to the mall there.",
      "\u201cRent was getting expensive, and we wanted something that was ours, not somebody else\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Foglia, 32, a carrier for the United States Postal Service. \u201cWe were still working in New York at that time, but the closer you got to the city, the more expensive it was. So we just kept heading down and decided that Freehold was where it was at.\u201d",
      "In August 2018, the couple bought a two-bedroom condominium in the Raintree development for $235,000, and two months later they married. Now they have a daughter who is nearly 2 and a second child on the way. And Mr. Foglia and Ms. Crimeni, the recreation director at the CentraState assisted living facility in Freehold, have no plans to move.",
      "\u201cWe love it here. Everything feels like what we were used to,\u201d Mr. Foglia said. \u201cIn Manalapan and Marlboro, the people are kind of flashy, but in Freehold, they\u2019re very down-to-earth.\u201d",
      "Roslyn Sibilia, an agent with ERA Central Realty Group, said clients like the Foglias, who make their way to the township from New York, typically travel south along Route 9, discovering that \u201cby the time you get to Freehold, everything seems to open up a lot more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hub, and that\u2019s what makes it desirable,\u201d said Ms. Sibilia, 52, who moved to Freehold Township from Manalapan, N.J., in 2004. \u201cWe have great park programs for parents and kids, a lot of good school choices, the mall, a major medical center. There\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d",
      "When Chris and Amy MacDougall bought their home in Freehold in 2010, Mr. MacDougall was already familiar with the township, having moved there with his family in 2000, when he was 21. Ten years later, he and his wife bought a four-bedroom 1960 colonial in East Freehold for their own growing family, paying $350,000. The MacDougalls are now very involved with their three daughters\u2019 school and sports activities: Ms. MacDougall helps with the high school yearbook, and Mr. MacDougall coaches the girls\u2019 soccer teams.",
      "A senior claims superintendent with Admiral Insurance Group, Mr. MacDougall, 44, describes the 38-square-mile township with major highways running through it as a \u201csweet spot,\u201d both geographically and demographically: \u201cSome towns are too snooty, but you don\u2019t get that facade here. In Freehold, it\u2019s real people with real jobs and real struggles. And we fit in perfectly with that.\u201d",
      "For Elizabeth Robertson, landing in Freehold was serendipitous. After 32 years of living in North Jersey, she was looking to change her life and \u201cjust threw everything up in the air\u201d in 2005. Knowing nothing about Freehold, but wanting to be near the beach \u2014 Freehold is about 18 miles west of the shore \u2014 Ms. Robertson moved first to a townhouse in East Freehold. Five years ago, she moved again, two miles south, paying $365,000 for a four-bedroom, split-level house that she shares with her daughter and two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cWhen I came here, I had no idea what kind of town this was,\u201d said Ms. Robertson, who is now 71 and retired. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve made a lot of good friends, and my grandchildren are now doing the same thing.\u201d",
      "Freehold Township is the expansive doughnut surrounding the much smaller Freehold Borough, the historic seat of Monmouth County. With shared high schools and many shared services, the township (pop. 35,367) and the borough (pop. 12,525) are frequently seen as interchangeable, although the township is more suburban, with more spacious lots and houses mostly built in the mid to late 20th century.",
      "Route 9, a major north-south highway dotted with shopping plazas and restaurants, is considered the dividing line between East Freehold, bordering Colts Neck and Marlboro, and West Freehold, bordering Howell and Jackson. East Freehold has some of the township\u2019s larger houses, most of which have access to public water and sewer systems, and is home to Poets Corner, a development with 376 townhouses and apartments. West Freehold is closer to the township\u2019s commercial activity and is home to Raintree, a gated community with more than 1,000 townhouses, condominiums and single-family houses.",
      "Naturally, both sections have their fans. \u201cPeople who live in West Freehold think it\u2019s the greatest, and those who live in East Freehold say they would never go to West,\u201d said Melissa DeSantis, 51, a broker associate with Real Broker LLC, who has made YouTube videos on both sections of the township, as well as Freehold Borough.",
      "The township also has three 55-plus adult-living communities, a mobile-home park and a sizable stock of affordable housing, including 250 units that will remain permanently affordable, said Maureen Fasano, a member of the Township Committee and a former mayor. Freehold Raceway Mall, the state\u2019s third largest mall, sits between Routes 9 and 33. CentraState Medical Center, on West Main Street, includes a 284-bed hospital, long-term care and a wellness center.",
      "The township has numerous parks as well, including a portion of the Monmouth Battlefield State Park and the Monmouth County Fairgrounds, which contribute to the more than 9,500 acres of open space. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a big commitment to green space,\u201d Ms. Fasano said, noting that the township recently increased the added tax for open space acquisitions to $0.04 per $1,000 of a home\u2019s assessed value.",
      "Freehold is considered more affordable than many of the neighboring areas. In 2022, the average sale price of a house in the township was $624,665, down slightly from 2021\u2019s average sale price of $636,276, according to the Monmouth Ocean Regional Multiple Listing Service.",
      "As of mid-February, there were 14 single-family houses on the market, along with six condominiums or townhouses and six homes in 55-plus communities. The lowest priced single-family house was a three-bedroom 1957 raised ranch house on 0.34 acres, listed for $299,900; the highest priced was a four-bedroom 2004 house on an acre, listed for $1.289 million. The lowest priced condominium or townhouse was a two-bedroom condo listed for $319,900; the highest priced was a two-bedroom townhouse listed for $427,500 (both were in the Raintree development). As for 55-plus homes, the least expensive was a two-bedroom bungalow listed for $179,900; the most expensive was a three-bedroom house in Regent Oaks, a new Toll Brothers community near Route 9, listed for $743,995.",
      "Much of the family-oriented activity takes place in Michael J. Tighe Park, a sprawling municipal park with ball fields, picnic sites, trails, a splash park and a summer park program. The 81-acre East Freehold Showgrounds is the site of numerous horse and dog shows, as well as the annual Monmouth County Fair.",
      "For indoor entertainment, residents head to the 175-acre Freehold Raceway Mall, which has an AMC movie theater and many chain stores and restaurants, or to iPlay America, a four-acre enclosed amusement park with games and rides. For evening entertainment, residents often head to Freehold Borough, with its Victorian-era Main Street lined with ethnic and upscale restaurants, or drive to nearby shoreline communities like Asbury Park or Belmar Beach.",
      "Public school students start out at one of Freehold\u2019s five elementary schools, moving on to one of two middle schools and then, depending on where they live, to Freehold Township High School, which has almost 2,000 students, or Freehold High School in Freehold Borough, which has about 1,300.",
      "As part of the Freehold Regional High School District, the township is linked to four other high schools in the area \u2014 in Manalapan, Howell, Colts Neck and Marlboro \u2014 each of which has subject-specific magnet programs to which Freehold students can apply. The Freehold Township High School\u2019s two magnet programs are in global studies and animal and botanical science; the high school in Freehold Borough has programs in culinary arts and hospitality, as well as medical sciences.",
      "In 2021-22, average SAT scores at the high school in Freehold Borough were 583 in reading and writing and 598 in math; at Freehold Township High School, they were 568 in reading and writing and 567 in math. (State averages were 557 in reading and 560 in math.)",
      "Private school options in the area include St. Rose of Lima, a Catholic school in Freehold Borough for students in prekindergarten through eighth grade, and the Peddie School, a day and boarding school in Hightstown for students in ninth through 12th grade.",
      "Many commuters catch the New Jersey Transit No. 139 bus at the Freehold Center station in Freehold Borough; the trip to Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan takes about 70 minutes and costs $16 one way or $377 for a monthly pass. Others catch the New Jersey Transit No. 67 bus at Freehold Raceway Mall and switch at Freehold Center; by that route, the trip to Port Authority takes about 90 minutes and costs $17.60 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "The closest train station is Aberdeen-Matawan, about 12 miles north. From there, the trip to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan on a direct New Jersey Transit train takes a little over an hour and costs $14.75 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "Freehold and neighboring Manalapan Township were the site of the Battle of Monmouth, one of the biggest and most important battles of the Revolutionary War. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army, led by George Washington, intercepted British troops traveling to New York City from Philadelphia in a battle that involved 26,000 soldiers and most of the major military figures of the time, including the Marquis de Lafayette, Benedict Arnold, Anthony Wayne and Alexander Hamilton. With 600 Americans killed and 700 British casualties, both sides claimed victory.",

      "The Metro-North train station is a three-minute walk, which makes it easy to head into New York City to visit friends. Happy hour deals and live jazz are right next door, at the Saltaire Oyster Bar. And he doesn\u2019t need a car to hit the local gym.",
      "But Mr. Yang does have a car, so he can commute to his job in Danbury, Conn., where he is an engineering manager in the medical device industry. Finding a place to park in Port Chester is not an issue \u2014 particularly compared to his experience in downtown White Plains, N.Y., where he used to live. And the village, in general, is \u201cmuch less congested,\u201d he said.",

      "She paid $515,000 for her two-bedroom home, which is convenient to downtown businesses, major highways and the Westchester County Airport. But while Ms. Curran loves her home\u2019s location, she is increasingly alarmed by the scale and pace of residential development planned for the compact downtown area.",

      "\u201cThey want to do all this major development in this tiny little village that does not have the infrastructure to handle it,\u201d Ms. Curran said. \u201cIt seems to me like an awful lot of major development in a very short period of time.\u201d",
      "The village has granted conditional site plan approval to projects with a total of more than 2,800 units over the past three years, said Stuart L. Rabin, the village manager. This flurry of development proposals is largely the result of a change in village zoning three years ago designed to encourage the redevelopment and revitalization of Port Chester\u2019s downtown, waterfront and transit-adjacent parcels, he said.",
      "\u201cThe village of Port Chester is certainly on the move,\u201d Mr. Rabin said.",
      "But the scale of the proposals has generated considerable public pushback, with some residents expressing concern that towering apartment buildings threaten to overwhelm the historic downtown and price out the many mom-and-pop businesses.",
      "John Allen, an elected member of Port Chester\u2019s board of trustees, said that while the village was \u201cripe for redevelopment,\u201d given the number of buildings in disrepair, there is a growing sense that the board allowed for \u201cthese extraordinary increases for density and asked for very little in return from developers,\u201d including having to meet more of the community\u2019s affordable housing needs.",
      "The board has recently begun to discuss a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d moratorium on development in order to study whether further changes are needed to the zoning code, he said. A moratorium would not affect projects already under construction.",
      "Port Chester is a densely developed village of 31,000 that \u201csprang to life at the crossroads of various transportation options,\u201d including a small harbor on Long Island Sound and rail lines into New York City, said Gregg Hamilton, a retired Manhattan transplant who runs the ",

      "Some remnants of its 19th- and early 20th-century industrial heyday remain. The Simons Manufacturing Company building, which once housed a major textile maker, is now a loft-style office complex. And the former headquarters of the Life Savers Candy Company now houses condominiums.",
      "In the walkable downtown area, beauty salons, restaurants and grocery stores catering to the village\u2019s majority-Hispanic population line the main thoroughfares of Westchester Avenue and North and South Main. (According to census data, the village population is 64 percent Hispanic, 28 percent white, 5 percent Black and 1 percent Asian.) Two large commercial bakeries \u2014 Neri\u2019s and J.J. Cassone \u2014 are major employers.",
      "Modest single-family and multifamily homes set close to the hilly streets surround the downtown. To the north, the streets are wider, and homes are set farther apart in suburban-style neighborhoods.",
      "A 15-acre abandoned hospital campus on the edge of downtown, ",
      ", is now set for redevelopment by Rose Associates and BedRock Real Estate Partners. The companies have received site plan approval for nearly 1,000 housing units, including 200 age-restricted units, and expect to begin demolition of the existing buildings by spring, said Richard Shea, a project spokesman.",
      "The nonprofit Carver Center supports the community\u2019s lower-income and immigrant populations with a food bank, citizenship classes, after-school programming and a teen center.",
      "As in most of Westchester County, housing inventory in Port Chester is very low and it is a seller\u2019s market, said Thomas E. Consaga, the broker-owner at Re/Max Ace Realty. Competition is particularly high among first-time buyers because home prices are considerably lower than in surrounding suburbs like Greenwich, Conn., and Rye, N.Y., he said.",
      "The median sale price for a single-family home in Port Chester last year was $645,000, almost 10 percent higher than in 2021. By comparison, the 2022 ",
      " in neighboring Greenwich was almost $3 million.",
      "As of last week, there were only about 20 single-family homes on the market, Mr. Consaga said. They ranged from a three-bedroom colonial built in 1955, listed for $475,000, to a six-bedroom colonial built in 1900, listed for $1.34 million.",
      "The median sale price for a condominium last year was $347,500; for a cooperative, it was $118,000, he said.",
      "Almost 60 percent of households in Port Chester are renter-occupied, according to census data. Over the last 12 months, the median rent for a two-bedroom was $2,800, Mr. Consaga said.",
      "That figure factors in the many older, multifamily homes in the village, but rents at the new apartment buildings are considerably higher. At Port & Main, which has a rooftop terrace and a fitness center, a 400-square-foot studio starts at $2,300 a month and an 1,150-square-foot, two-bedroom rents for more than $4,000, said Whitney Okun, who runs a development group at Houlihan Lawrence that is overseeing the project.",
      "The Capitol Theater, on Westchester Avenue, books big-name artists that draw music lovers from throughout the region. Concertgoers swarm the wide array of downtown restaurants, including El Tio, Bartaco, T&J Restaurant and Pizzeria, and Panka Peruvian Bistro.",
      "The parking lot at the Waterfront at Port Chester mall is jammed on weekends with shoppers stocking up at Costco. The mall\u2019s other draw is a 14-screen AMC movie theater.",
      "The growing arts scene includes the well-established Clay Art Center, a large complex with numerous pottery studios and classrooms, as well as a public gallery, and Ice Cream Social, a relatively new space where artists working in various media can rent private or shared studios.",
      "\u201cPort Chester is my hometown, so it\u2019s kind of a dream to be able to support the artists who are here,\u201d said Jennifer Cacciola, an artist and a founder of the center, who moved to Connecticut from Brooklyn shortly before the pandemic.",
      "The Port Chester-Rye Union Free School District serves students in all of Port Chester and about a third of the neighboring village of Rye Brook. Of the roughly 4,500 students districtwide, about 83 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino, 12 percent as white, 3 percent as Black and 2 percent as Asian, according to state education data.",
      "The district contracts with Corpus Christi Holy Rosary School to provide a prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds. Students in kindergarten through fifth grade attend one of four elementary schools; those in sixth through eighth grade attend Port Chester Middle School.",
      "Port Chester High School is on a 20-acre campus bordering Rye Brook, with about 1,600 students. Academic offerings include Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses. The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2022 was 88 percent.",
      "Port Chester station, on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven line, is in the heart of downtown. The ride to Grand Central during peak commuting times takes just under an hour; the one-way fare is $13.75, and a monthly pass is $270.",

      " offers transportation from Port Chester to Rye, Harrison, Mamaroneck, Larchmont, New Rochelle and the Bronx.",

As the factories closed, more immigrants from throughout Central and South America settled in the working-class village, opening restaurants and servicing the affluent suburbs as landscapers, day laborers, house cleaners and child-care providers. The population growth hasn\u2019t been without tensions: In 2009, a federal judge ordered the village to adopt a new voting system that would give the Hispanic and Latino population a fairer opportunity to elect one of their own to the board of trustees.

      "\u201cIt really changed things,\u201d Mr. Manilow said. \u201cWe were able to have our dogs with us, and to have those creatures greet you at the door. We were out of town, but every night after the performance it felt like I was coming home.\u201d",
      "The precise nature and quality of a performer\u2019s temporary residence are part of the compensation package. \u201cThese deals are negotiated on a case-by-case basis,\u201d said Ryan Conway, the owner of Architect Theatrical, a Broadway and Off Broadway general management firm.",
      "During the pandemic, Mr. Conway said, a lot of actors moved out of New York with their families and put down roots elsewhere. \u201cIf they get cast in a show that will bring them back to New York, a housing stipend becomes pretty important,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may not take the job unless it makes sense to support two households. I\u2019m having more of those conversations now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s one big headache for out-of-town actors who don\u2019t have a lot of money or bargaining chips and find that a stipend won\u2019t take them very far. Couch surfing puts a strain on backs and friendships. Rentals of less than a year are hard to come by, and rentals of less than 30 days are legally problematic. Working with a real estate broker often means paying a fee. (For perspective, most actors are not rich. The median wage for actors was $23.48 an hour in May 2021, according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)",
      "These days, many actors and other entertainment professionals turn to the Lee List, a by-invitation-only peer-to-peer platform that posts ads for the apartments and houses that its members are offering for rent in cities around the country and around the world. New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Nashville, Santa Fe, N.M., Vancouver, B.C., Paris, and Tel Aviv (and Milford, Conn.) are just some of those represented.",
      "A property is displayed along with a picture and relevant information \u2014 for example the number of bedrooms, the amenities, when it will be available and for how long, and, of course, the rent. Interested parties fill out a contact form at the bottom of a posting.",
      "The list is the creation of Heather Lee, a Los Angeles-based actor who relocated to New York when she was cast as Tessie Tura (\u201cYou Gotta Get a Gimmick\u201d) in the 2003 Broadway revival of \u201cGypsy,\u201d and vividly recalled the difficulty in nailing down a home. \u201cI had to pick up my life and move, and in those days there was no Facebook, no Airbnb.",
      "\u201cI did get a moving stipend, but finding a place was up to me,\u201d continued Ms. Lee, who initially stayed with the friend of a friend, then through the friend of another friend, she found a rental she could afford on the Upper West Side.",
      "The experience made her want to smooth the way for others. When actors booked a national tour or a job at a regional theater and sent out emails offering their homes for sublet, Ms. Lee diligently spread the word among her buddies.",
      "Soon enough she was fielding emails from actors she didn\u2019t know. \u201cHey, I hear you\u2019ve got this great contact list,\u201d began a typical message. \u201cI have an apartment I\u2019m trying to rent out for a few months. Would you send this notice out for me?\u201d Or someone would write and say, \u201cI just got a job and I\u2019m scrambling for a place to live\u2026.\u201d",
      "Ms. Lee began forwarding these requests to others in her address book. Sometimes she would email the apartment hunters and ask when precisely they needed a place, in what part of New York City (or wherever) and for how long. \u201cPeople started telling me I should start charging, but I wasn\u2019t looking for that,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to help my fellow artists.\u201d",
      "And yet, as the inbox traffic grew to a jam, Ms. Lee decided, in 2009, to establish a dedicated Gmail account and charge $5 per email blast to what was then 300 colleagues. A Broadway producer friend came up with the name Lee List, and in 2013 \u2014 with steady users then at 6,000 \u2014 Ms. Lee launched the website\u00a0that also acts as a marketplace for\u00a0furniture, jobs and other goods and services.",
      "The roster, which has grown to more than 20,000, includes writers, directors, choreographers, producers, designers, agents, grips, managers and actors \u2014 among them Ms. Toussaint, who in early March was zeroing in on a \u201clovely flat\u201d that would be available during an upcoming trip to London.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper than a hotel,\u201d said Jeff Greenberg, a casting director who, during one trip to New York from his home in Los Angeles, stayed in a theater district rental with impressive d\u00e9cor: the Tony Award won by the lease holder, Paul Kreppel, an actor, director and producer. \u201cI\u2019d never had a Tony as a roommate before,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said.",
      "Lee List members are an international group, but with a concentration in New York and Los Angeles. Some 95 percent of the members are in the entertainment industry, but even if they\u2019re in another business, they\u2019ve likely got some connection to the arts community \u2014 for example, a yoga instructor with showbiz clients.",
      "Ms. Lee says this all stands to reason: \u201cThe model is based on one degree of separation,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery member knows at least one other member.\u201d",
      "So it seems. Cass and Andy Lilien (she\u2019s a jewelry designer, he\u2019s a director of photography) own and live in a building on the Lower East Side with two rental units, both popular on the Lee List. Currently in residence: Jonathan Glew, the associate director of a new Broadway production of \u201cA Doll\u2019s House.\u201d",
      "\u201cJonathan mentioned that he had worked on the recent London production of \u2018The Seagull,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Lilien said. \u201cand it just so happened that one of our regulars had been in the cast. So we took a selfie and sent it to her.\u201d",
      "While someone at the Lee List reviews all the postings before they\u2019re uploaded, \u201cwe\u2019re not a real estate company. We don\u2019t take a commission,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cPeople agree to certain rules when they become a member \u2014 that they will treat one another with respect. We expect that the pictures are an accurate representation of the property.\u201d Membership can be \u2014 and has been \u2014 revoked for conduct unbecoming, such as failing to honor the terms of a financial agreement.",
      "The invitation request form asks questions like, How long have you known your friend? How did you meet? Are you work colleagues? What is the nature of your relationship now? Then there is an open-ended request: Tell us more about your friend. The form also asks for an identifying website link, such as an entry on the internet Broadway database (IBDB) or the internet movie database (IMDB) or LinkedIn.",
      "Once welcomed to the fold, people can join for a month ($14.95), for three months ($39.95) or for a year ($89.95). Membership allows Lee clients to view the real estate on offer.",
      "In mid-March, there were 14 rental openings in Atlanta, including a guesthouse with a pool for $3,000, as well as 135 in Los Angeles and 22 in New York. A one-bedroom furnished apartment on the Lower East Side was going for $2,600 a month with a flexible end date, while a furnished studio in the same neighborhood will be available starting in late June for $5,750 a month. It is the responsibility of those renting out their apartments to follow the rules of their building and the laws of their municipality. In New York State for example, the ",
      " prohibits short-term rentals (fewer than 30 days) in buildings with three or more units.",
      "Some members get a little bit more, perhaps, than they bargained for.",
      "When Beth Malone was cast as the adult version of Alison Bechdel in the original Broadway production of \u201cFun Home\u201d in 2015, she and her wife, Rochelle Schoppert, posted their three-bedroom house in Los Angeles on the Lee List. Except for a few months here and there, the property has been rented out for the past eight years.",
      "\u201cI drive by my house and stalk it,\u201d said Ms. Malone, who\u2019s now part of the cast of the forthcoming Apple TV+ crime drama \u201cCity on Fire.\u201d \u201cBecause people from the Lee List are living there, we feel they\u2019re treating it better than others might.",
      "\u201cThey invited us over, and we saw that they moved the furniture,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s cuter than when we lived there.\u201d"

      "You have several options worth exploring. In New York State, seniors have certain \u201c",
      "\u201d when it comes to renting apartments. For example, depending on where you see yourself living next, tenants who are at least 62 years old may terminate their lease without penalty if they\u2019re moving into a health care facility, senior housing complex or government subsidized housing, said Andrew Scherer, a professor of law at New York Law School and the author of \u201cResidential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York.\u201d",
      "Because the faulty elevator has created a health hazard, you also could potentially break your lease and claim that you have been \u201cconstructively evicted,\u201d Mr. Scherer said. According to Cornell Law School\u2019s Legal Information Institute, ",
      " can be claimed in court when a tenant has moved out of a rental unit over an issue that caused the unit to become unlivable, and the landlord has failed to resolve the problem despite being notified.",
      "Mr. Scherer noted that the landlord is legally obligated to to relet the apartment if you leave before the lease ends. \u201cThe tenant will not be liable for rent for the remainder of the lease if the landlord either relets the apartment or fails to take reasonable steps to relet,\u201d he said, though he suggested consulting an attorney before pursuing any legal option.",
      "If you choose to stay, there are other routes you could take. Failure to keep the elevator functioning \u201cis a breach of the landlord\u2019s obligation to maintain the residence,\u201d Mr. Scherer said. So you could be entitled to a reduction of rent for the months you\u2019ve gone without it working properly. You also could band with your neighbors and form a tenants\u2019 association to \u201ccommence a legal proceeding to obtain a court order to force the landlord to fix the problem,\u201d he said. You could do this alone, too, but having more people on board will only help your chances.",

      "Last year, Kasey Woods was finally having her moment. She was thriving in her professional life as a publicist with a growing list of clients, so she was ready to settle into a longer term relationship \u2014 with a bigger apartment that could hold her family of four.",
      "Like so many others, she and her three children had been rocked by the pandemic a few years earlier. She had been grateful to live in a three-bedroom, two-bath house in the Bronx where on good days, she could find a parking space and was able to take both girls to their schools in White Plains in under half an hour. But the house quickly became too small, especially as she worked from home and her son Treylin, 21, and daughters London, 14, and Gia, 11, attended school remotely.",
      "\u201cI had my own company by that point. Working from a little corner in the living room was not conducive when you have children. I needed a more grown-up space,\u201d said Ms. Woods, 41, who shares custody with her ex-partner who lives in White Plains. \u201cMy daughters were battling it out and needed their own room, which they have at their dad\u2019s. I wanted to equal it out.\u201d",
      "Ms. Woods\u2019s lease was up at the end of 2022, so the first week of that November, she began combing Craigslist, which is how she found the Bronx house. The goal was to be fully situated in a new location by Christmas.",
      "\u201cI wanted a four or five-bedroom home because even though my son is at Howard University, and hardly ever home, I didn\u2019t want him to feel we were moving on without him,\u201d Ms. Woods said. \u201cI thought $5,000 per month would get me that, plus an office.\u201d",
      "Ideal locations were Harlem and Washington Heights, with Yonkers coming third in her preferences, \u201cbecause those were doorman buildings on the water,\u201d she said. Upon seeing them in person, however, \u201ceverything felt scam-ish and unsafe. The postings didn\u2019t have photos or feel authentic.\u201d",
      "She then turned to StreetEasy. Over the next month she saw a number of places and begrudgingly worked with three different brokers, \u201call who took a fee, which is hard when you\u2019re looking at an expensive rental,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019d found my own places.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe man who approves the units went on vacation because it was the end of the year,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen he returned, the apartment I was shown was gone.\u201d",

      "Then came the moving issues. A hopeful weekend relocation took a draining and debilitating three weeks. Because of the unexpected costs, Ms. Woods went with cheaper movers, who only transported some of her belongings because they said she did not correctly describe the inventory. Another mover took her deposit, she said, then ghosted her. Ms. Woods rented a small truck and filled it with boxes to make the 13-minute trip to and from one home to another when she could. Finally, a third mover transported the last of her items.",

Gia and my office are on the third,\u201d said Ms. Woods, who explained that it was important for her psyche to leave one room, get coffee downstairs and then move to another room, which is why her office and bedroom aren\u2019t on the same floor. The basement has a pullout couch for when her son comes home from college.",
      "There have been learning curves: Ms. Woods\u2019s new home uses oil. During the first month, she unknowingly drained the tank and was without heat for days. \u201cA hundred gallons costs a lot,\u201d she said.",
      "Ms. Woods thought she would appreciate having stairs, but not so much \u2014 especially since there\u2019s no bathroom on the first floor. She misses the city and",
      "her bodega. And then there\u2019s the commute to and from Manhattan.",
      "\u201cThe commuting can be a lot, but when I walk through the door, and see this great house, that doesn\u2019t have any mice, which we had in our old apartment, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d she said.",
      "There are other positives, too. She takes morning walks around neighborhood for exercise and to explore, something she was unable to do before. \u201cWhere I lived wasn\u2019t safe,\u201d she said.",

      "Ivana Trump was best known for her more-is-more approach to life. She and her most famous ex-husband had their differences over the years, but on that front they were united.",
      "Dresses were covered in crystals, furs were fashioned in nearly every color of the rainbow, and her bouffant ascended high enough to grace the ceilings of many New York rooms \u2014 but not those in her Upper East Side home, a 20-foot-wide, 8,725-square-foot, five-story mansion. The townhouse, which she turned into her very own rococo paradise, is now listed on the market for $26.5 million. ",
      " after falling down the stairs last year.",
      "The house is less than a block from Central Park and became \u2014 according to ",
      ", a close friend since the late 1970s \u2014 a five-bedroom, five-bathroom metaphor in limestone for Ms. Trump\u2019s refusal to shrink in size or stature after the 1990 implosion of her marriage to Donald J. Trump. His older children were raised there, and the proceeds from the house will be divided among them when it sells.",
      "Yet, five months after being listed with Douglas Elliman, the house is still available.",
      "Is it simply another indication that the market has retreated since interest rates soared and stock market portfolios shrank? Is it an extension of the fact that Trump-branded properties in this true-blue town ",
      ", when Ms. Trump\u2019s ex-husband launched the divisive political campaign that took him to the White House? Or is the problem that the house\u2019s anachronistic aesthetic is the polar opposite of the minimalist modernism that is standard in high-end homes today?",
      "Ms. Trump purchased her home on East 64th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues in 1992, when she was finalizing the terms of her divorce from The Donald, as he was then known.",
      "The seller was Francois de Menil, who purchased it in 1979 for $1 million but never moved in. After that, it became \u201ca dentist\u2019s office with lots of small rooms,\u201d Ms. Trump later said.",
      "Dennis Basso, the designer of Ms. Trump\u2019s many minks, said in an interview that he thought it looked more like an embassy than a home. Ms. Haskell hated the stairs.",
      "\u201cActually,\u201d she said, reconsidering, \u201cI hated the entire house.\u201d",
      "\u201cIvana wanted her house to be glam, or her idea of it,\u201d Mr. Basso said. \u201cAnd she was wise enough to get it in one of the best locations in the city.\u201d",
      "She had to fight Mr. Trump to lock down the money to buy it.",
      "The divorce agreement ironed out between lawyers for the former couple entitled Mr. Trump to the apartment he and his wife had shared at the top of Trump Tower. Upon moving out, Ms. Trump was to receive $4 million to be spent on a new home for their three children, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric.",
      "But when Ms. Trump wrote a novel, \u201cFor Love Alone,\u201d that depicted the blowup of a high-profile marriage, Mr. Trump sued her, claiming that she\u2019d broken a confidentiality clause in the contract.",
      "He even suggested that Ms. Trump seek assistance from her boyfriend at the time, Riccardo Mazzucchelli, an Italian industrialist who built highways in Africa, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.",
      "\u201cNow she wants to buy a townhouse,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to give her the money so she and her lover can have a house. Let him pay for it. I hear he has some money.\u201d",
      "Ms. Trump\u2019s attorneys lobbied a state Supreme Court justice, Phyllis Gangel-Jacob, to compel Mr. Trump to pay the $282,500 down payment. Ultimately she got the money she needed. Public records show the overall sale price was just under $2.47 million.",
      "After that, Ms. Trump brought in George Gregorian, a designer who had collaborated with her on the Trumps\u2019 rebrand of the Plaza Hotel, and got to work.",
      "\u201cThe plumbing was all rotten,\u201d she told People magazine. \u201cI put, like, a bulldozer through the rooms and totally redid it.\u201d",
      "When the contractors were done, the parlor floor served as the entryway and had a powder room and office for Dorothy Curry, who worked as an assistant to Ms. Trump and helped care for the children.",
      "The second floor was the site of an enormous living room and a piano room.",
      "On three was a leopard-print sitting room, a pink marble bathroom and a primary bedroom with a gold-embossed fireplace and Chinese murals that, Ms. Trump wrote in the book \u201cRaising Trump: Family Values From America\u2019s First Mother,\u201d were \u201crestored by artists referred to me by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\u201d",
      "The children\u2019s rooms were on four, and much of five was taken up by a closet that Ms. Trump referred to as \u201cIndochine\u201d because, as she later said, \u201cby the time you get to the end of it, you might as well be in another continent.\u201d (There were also rooms on five for Ms. Trump\u2019s mother, Marie Zelnickova, as well as the housekeepers.)",
      "Animal-print carpeting, giant mirrors and other Louis XIV-style detailing abounded.",
      "\u201cThere was nothing modern about the house, but it was fabulous, all Old World glamour with bits of camp thrown in,\u201d said Marc Bouwer, a designer whose clothes Ms. Trump wore often over the years. He was a fixture at the parties Ms. Trump threw for a guest list that befit her persona.",
      "Here was Barbara Walters. There were Joan Collins and an assortment of Upper East Side socialites, the sort who dressed conservatively but \u201cliked publicity, liked to be in the newspapers,\u201d Mr. Bouwer said.",
      "A plan to put a swimming pool in the basement did not pan out, but there was a gym on the sixth floor. And, because the treadmill faced out onto the street, Ms. Trump would wave to Donatella Versace, who in 1997 moved into her brother Gianni\u2019s house at 5 East 64th Street, after his death.",
      "By then Ms. Trump was ending her next marriage, to Mr. Mazzucchelli, who had divided his time between London and Ms. Trump\u2019s townhouse in New York but could not deal with what Ms. Haskell described as living in Ivana\u2019s shadow.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cIt all became too much.\u201d",
      "In the early 2000s, after the children graduated from high school, Ms. Trump began spending more time in South Florida and Saint-Tropez, where she also had homes. She threw herself into dating and even hosted a reality show, \u201cIvana Young Man,\u201d in which she helped a divorced 40-year-old woman find a younger mate. (It aired once on Oxygen and was not picked up as a full series.)",
      "In 2008, Ms. Trump married a young man of her own, Rossano Rubicondi, a sometime actor in his 30s who appeared on the show. The marriage was turbulent and lasted ",
      ".",
      "In 2009, Ms. Trump was escorted off a plane after getting in an argument with a group of children running through first class.",
      "In 2016, she offered full-throated support to Mr. Trump\u2019s successful presidential run. But afterward she was devastated that she was not first lady and that the children she had raised were largely in Washington. She was accosted on the street by anti-Trumpers, yet refused security that might have made her feel safer.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Get a handsome security guard,\u2019\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t. The whole presidency took a tremendous toll on her.\u201d ",
      "According to Ms. Haskell, Ms. Trump never fully got over Mr. Trump. But Mr. Rubicondi continued to pop up.",
      "Ms. Haskell thought he was after Ms. Trump\u2019s money. \u201cI used to say, \u2018His meter is always running,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Concern about Ms. Trump\u2019s mental state grew, and the house that had once been a symbol of Ms. Trump\u2019s resilience began to seem more like a sign that things were going awry.",
      "\u201cI begged her to get rid of it and move into a full-service residence at the Pierre,\u201d said Ms. Haskell, referring to a nearby luxury hotel. \u201cBut Ivana was Ivana. She did exactly what she wanted to do.\u201d",
      "Ms. Haskell talked to Ms. Trump repeatedly about the stairs she couldn\u2019t stand because \u201cthey were narrow toward the banister and wide toward the walls.\u201d",
      "What frightened Ms. Trump was not falling down the stairs, but getting stuck in the elevator. So she didn\u2019t take it.",
      "Then, in 2020, shortly after the pandemic began, Mr. Rubicondi was diagnosed with Stage 4 skin cancer. Ms. Trump flew him from Italy to New York, and got him an apartment near the townhouse so he could receive treatment here, according to New York Magazine. But he died in October 2021.",
      "When vaccinations loosened Covid-19 restrictions, friends thought Ms. Trump would be thrilled to re-emerge. Instead, she retreated, \u201chousebound by her own desire,\u201d as Ms. Haskell put it.",
      "In retrospect, Mr. Basso said, it should have been perfectly clear Ms. Trump was never going to leave.",
      "\u201cWhere was she going to go?\u201d Mr. Basso said. \u201cFrom that house to a two-bedroom apartment? She wasn\u2019t doing that. She liked her environment, she was happy with the way it looked, and whether it\u2019s your taste or mine doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "But Ms. Haskell said that when she heard in July that Ms. Trump had died, the first words out of her mouth were \u201cThe stairs?\u201d",
      "Ms. Trump\u2019s condominium in South Florida near Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago ",
      " Ms. Curry, her longtime assistant. Eric took charge of the sale of the townhouse, according to a person who has had some involvement with the listing and declined to comment because Eric has asked everyone involved not to do interviews about it.",
      "To handle the sale, the family selected Adam Modlin of The Modlin Group and Roger Erickson of Douglas Elliman. In 2020, Mr. Modlin worked for Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s estate on the sale of Mr. Epstein\u2019s Upper East Townhouse. He has also worked for the estate to sell Mr. Epstein\u2019s two Caribbean islands. (A representative at Douglas Elliman said Mr. Modlin and Mr. Erickson would not comment.)",
      "There is little question that the value of the residences at Trump-branded properties in New York took a hit after he launched his 2016 campaign for President. But another, perhaps more significant obstacle for Ms. Trump\u2019s adult children, Mr. Basso said, is that the property is huge and the design not to everyone\u2019s taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty facade,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one is buying the place and not redoing it. It may have been done by the best designer of its period, but nobody with this kind of money wants a 30-year-old bathroom, and that\u2019s how long she was in that apartment.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the market has corrected since its pandemic peak.",
      " from Ms. Trump sits the ",
      " formerly owned by the Versaces.",
      "It, too, has a limestone facade, gilded curtains, stately chandeliers and leopard print carpeting.",
      "When that house was first placed on the market last spring, the asking price was $70 million. According ",
      ", it can now be had for $60 million.",
      "By contrast, Ms. Trump\u2019s children are asking for a mere $26.5 million, and the death of the house\u2019s last resident is not exactly a selling point.",
      "\u201cIvana brought a warmth and excitement to the house,\u201d Mr. Bouwer said. \u201cNow it seems a little creepy, particularly given that she passed away there and so alone. It\u2019s heartbreaking to think about.\u201d"

      "Functionality is important in a foyer or entry hall: You need somewhere to put down your packages and keys, take off your shoes and hang up your jacket.",
      "But there\u2019s something else that matters just as much. Whether you have a proper foyer or not, the entry to your home is the first space you (and your guests) encounter after stepping through the front door. Why not give it some style and spark a little joy?",
      "The foyer \u201csets the stage for what\u2019s to come in the rest of the house,\u201d said Jennifer Bunsa, the founder of ",
      ", a Miami-based interior design firm. Because entryways are often small, they\u2019re usually not very architecturally impressive, she added, \u201cso we want to introduce some other elements that will attract the eye and make an impact.\u201d",
      "We asked her and other interior designers for some advice on how to do that.",
      "In any small space \u2014 a powder room, a foyer \u2014 adding wallpaper, an appealing paint color or paneling can make the room feel more special. \u201cSometimes people get a bit scared of using wallpaper in a space that maybe isn\u2019t huge, because they feel like it might be too busy for the eye,\u201d said Nicole Salvesen, a founder of ",
      ", a London-based interior design firm. \u201cBut it can actually help to calm the space.\u201d",
      "In an Arts-and-Crafts-style house in Boulder, Colo., Salvesen Graham added ",
      " wallpaper with a repeating blue-and-green floral pattern, and painted the trim around it sage green. That helped create a cohesive look \u201cthat\u2019s actually gentle on the eyes,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said. In the narrow entrance hall of a home in London, the designers used a different approach to similar effect, adding fluted-plaster panels to the walls to create visual interest without making the space feel suffocating.",
      "When designing the foyer of her midcentury-modern home in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y., ",
      ", a New York-based designer, lined the walls with custom wallpaper from ",
      ". The pattern features pieces of silver leaf that are crowded together near the ceiling but spaced out farther down the walls, so they appear to be tumbling toward the floor. \u201cIt looks almost like snowflakes,\u201d Ms. Woodhouse said, creating an effect that is eye-catching but \u201cvery light, bright and airy.\u201d",
      "As you put on and take off your shoes, it\u2019s natural to focus on the floor of your entryway. That creates another opportunity to do something interesting.",
      "Ms. Bunsa is a fan of using encaustic cement tiles with colorful graphic patterns in foyers. In a home in Jamesport, N.Y., she installed hexagonal tiles with mustard, light blue and dark blue details from ",
      " in a randomized pattern for a bold, geometric look. In her own home in Miami, she used rectangular tiles with free-form, black-and-white shapes, also from Popham Design, running them across the floor and up one wall.",
      "\u201cI wanted to play with the idea of the classic black-and-white checkerboard tile floor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the Popham tile changes it up and makes it feel more modern.\u201d",
      "For a client\u2019s home in Roslyn, N.Y., Ms. Woodhouse riffed on a traditional stone floor by installing triangular marble tiles from ",
      " in various colors, including white, black, red, pink, blue and green. \u201cBecause it was a small space, we were looking for that eye-candy moment that would pop,\u201d Ms. Woodhouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you would least expect it, which really makes a statement.\u201d",
      "If a statement floor isn\u2019t for you, or if you already have a serviceable plain floor in place, you could change the look of the ceiling with paint or wallpaper.",
      "When ",
      ", an interior designer based in Northern California, was renovating the foyer of a 1906 house with a dark hardwood floor and handsome white wall paneling, she decided to liven things up by adding striped wallpaper from Schumacher to the ceiling.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to keep it feeling very elegant, but add a playful quality,\u201d Ms. Clark said. Now, she said, \u201cThe room has an almost tented feel.\u201d",
      "A foyer is a great place to install a sculptural pendant, chandelier or sconces, as large light fixtures can make small spaces feel a little more grand. In a country house in Surrey, England, the designers at Salvesen Graham installed a pair of ",
      " metal-and-glass globe pendants in a narrow entryway. \u201cChoosing a big, round light fitting can make the space feel a bit wider and more spacious,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said.",
      "In the foyer of a house outside San Francisco, Ms. Clark chose a traditional two-foot-tall lantern from ",
      " for the center of the space. The powder-coated pink metal frame adds a touch of whimsy. \u201cIt\u2019s just that pop of color, which is unexpected,\u201d Ms. Clark said.",
      ", a New York-based interior designer, sometimes looks for light fixtures that offer multiple points of light. In a house in Los Angeles, she installed a multi-armed, flush-mount fixture that stretches out with eight diffusers. For a home in Palm Beach, Fla., she chose a ",
      " fixture with six shades woven from recycled soda bottles sprouting from a single ceiling canopy on multicolored cords.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to juxtapose the formality of the architecture with some really good informality,\u201d Ms. Vi\u00f1as said.",
      "When guests arrive at a 19th-century Gothic Revival house in upstate New York where Ms. Vi\u00f1as designed the interiors, the center table in the foyer, from ",
      ", stops them in their tracks: It\u2019s shaped like a pig, with a tray on its back. \u201cHaving the first object you see inside be a little tongue-in-cheek is unusual,\u201d Ms. Vi\u00f1as said. \u201cDoing things that are not just the obvious choices speaks to the personalities of the people who live there.\u201d",
      "Of course, those choices don\u2019t have to be so playful, but selecting standout furniture and accessories that encourage closer inspection can help make the foyer a destination. When designing her home in Miami, for instance, Ms. Bunsa installed a geometric planter from ",
      " in Yves Klein blue that holds a tall cactus, as well as a bench with an intricately woven seat from ",
      " to create multiple moments of interest.",
      "In more traditional homes, Salvesen Graham aims to mix intriguing antiques, fabrics with colorful patterns and contemporary art to create interiors that feel lively. In the foyer the firm designed in Surrey, for instance, they installed antique blue-and-white ceramics, lampshades and pillows made with a yellow gingham fabric and three-dimensional cut-paper contemporary art by ",
      " mounted in an acrylic box.",
      "\u201cIn all our interiors, we use antiques and vintage pieces to help the house feel more authentic and grounded,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said. \u201cWe use a real mix, because that\u2019s how people really live.\u201d",
      "Ms. Salvesen also recommended installing full-size furniture, even in moderately sized foyers where you may assume you need smaller pieces. While truly tiny entryways do require space-saving furniture, if you have just a little extra breathing room, \u201cbig pieces of furniture can stop it from feeling like a long, narrow space,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said, and make it look like a proper room.",
      "If you have enough space, install a bench with a generous upholstered seat, for example, rather than one so skinny it feels like sitting on a two-by-four. If you have an empty corner, bring in an armchair. Likewise, choose an impressive credenza or center table instead of feeling like you have to find a shallow console or wall shelf.",
      "Ms. Woodhouse, blessed with a large entry space, took this approach to heart and installed a velvet-covered ottoman that provides seating on all sides. \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually hang out in entryways,\u201d Ms. Woodhouse said. \u201cBut I have to tell you, people actually hang out in my entryway.\u201d",

      "\u201cI wanted land and more space,\u201d said Mr. Sayre, 37, a creative director who grew up in Los Angeles. They were also looking for proximity to beaches, he added, \u201cwhich I can\u2019t live without.\u201d",
      "Their search extended from Essex to Mystic, and after about eight months of looking, they found a property they \u201ccouldn\u2019t resist,\u201d he said. It was a 4,500-square-foot home on an acre in East Lyme, a town on Long Island Sound, in New London County.",
      "The Sayres submitted an offer last May and were disappointed when they lost out to another bidder. But when that deal subsequently fell through, the owner circled back to the couple and they closed in July for $500,000.",
      "Now raising a newborn daughter, they have grown fond of the restaurants and shops in downtown Niantic, one of two villages in this 34-square-mile community. And their neighbors, they say, couldn\u2019t be nicer. Overall, \u201cwe love the fact that it\u2019s clean, safe, peaceful and quiet,\u201d Mr. Sayre said.",

      "They found a three-story, two-bedroom waterfront home in a family-friendly beach community in Niantic, paying $424,100, and finished the basement so that Ms. Cooke, 42, a pediatric speech and language pathologist, can work with her young clients there.",
      "\u201cWe have beautiful beaches within a mile of our home,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking out for everyone in our community, and it\u2019s an excellent place to raise a child. There\u2019s an Easter egg hunt and a field day around the Fourth of July.\u201d",

    "name": "How to Grow Dahlias? A Ceramist Has Some Advice for You",

      "It\u2019s time to unpack the dahlias, and Frances Palmer finds herself surrounded by 25 sizable cardboard cartons full of tubers that she dug up and then stored last fall in the frost-proof cellar of her barn.",
      "To complete the coals-to-Newcastle scene: Several boxes of new tubers she ordered have just arrived, too. Who could have resisted ordering them, even when already in possession of a massive overwintered inventory?",
      "Not ",
      ", a ceramist based in Weston, Conn., whose art and garden have intertwined and grown together over three decades. Each has informed the other, taking on a bit of its shape and character.",
      "Dahlias to the max \u2014 apparently there can be no such thing as too many dahlias. As she put it, \u201cThey\u2019re just so joyous.\u201d",
      "The products of her two forms of self-expression have posed for many portraits together, as Ms. Palmer, 66, has cultivated a third creative pursuit: photography. The images fill her popular ",
      " and her 2020 book, \u201cLife in the Studio: Inspiration and Lessons on Creativity.\u201d",
      "Ms. Palmer\u2019s ceramics are highly distinctive, but entirely functional. These vases, dinnerware and serving pieces are meant to be sold, and used. From the start, she wanted to document her designs, and realized she could lend a sense of scale by working in some props. Like flowers in the vases.",
      "\u201cThat was really my impetus to start gardening,\u201d she said. Once she did, no flower tugged at her harder than the dahlia.",
      "In her connection to them, Ms. Palmer is in good company among creative women, including Frida Kahlo (who grew them in her garden in Mexico, where dahlias are native, and was frequently pictured wearing them like a crown). Vanessa Bell, a member of the Bloomsbury Group, grew and painted dahlias at Charleston farmhouse in East Sussex, England, and a memorable photograph of the contemporary Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama as a child shows her holding four giant ones.",
      "That\u2019s no surprise, really, considering the flowers\u2019 vivid color palette, sculptural geometry (the shapes include preposterous pompons and balls as well as spiky cactus-like blooms) and size (from less than two inches to almost a foot across).",
      "Although she won\u2019t put a number on it, Ms. Palmer acknowledges growing \u201chundreds\u201d of dahlia plants a season, each given just enough real estate to accommodate the tomato cage supporting it. The goal: an abundant flower harvest.",
      "\u201cBecause my garden functions as a cutting garden, I just use the tomato cages, and they go cheek by jowl,\u201d she said.",
      "The plants fill two large, fenced garden areas: four 16-by-16-foot beds in one space and 30 raised beds of four-by-eight feet or longer atop an old tennis court, where she also keeps several beehives.",
      "And it\u2019s not just dahlias she grows to cut.",
      "\u201cI have all sorts of things happening,\u201d she said, ticking off a flowering cascade from spring bulbs to sweet peas, annual poppies and natives like asters and ironweed (Vernonia) that peak simultaneously with the dahlias. \u201cBut the dahlias always get the best \u2014 and the most \u2014 real estate, and everything else gets pushed in between. It\u2019s quite chaotic.\u201d",
      "Visitors to her annual Garden Conservancy Open Day (this year, it\u2019s ",
      ") don\u2019t seem to mind.",
      "Everything appears in delightful excess, unfolding toward \u201ca great crescendo in the garden,\u201d from the time the dahlias get going, by mid-July or so, right through till frost says stop and those cardboard boxes get loaded up again.",
      "Most of us will never try growing \u201chundreds\u201d of dahlias \u2014 even over many seasons. There are almost 11,000 named dahlias on the American Dahlia Society\u2019s composite list of varieties, from 1976 to the present; international groups list even more. The largest source in the United States, Swan Island Dahlias, carries more than 400.",
      "So which ones should we seek out?",
      "It\u2019s a topic that Ms. Palmer, who also recommends Ferncliff Gardens, Old House Gardens and Queen Valley Farm as sources, covers with students at the New York Botanical Garden in the Dauntless Dahlias course she has taught every March and October since 2015.",
      "\u201cThink abstractly versus specifically,\u201d she advises. Consider which colors, shapes and forms you prefer \u2014 and what scale.",
      "Don\u2019t obsess over the names of the dahlias, because if you can\u2019t find them, it\u2019s really irrelevant,\u201d she tells her students as she projects images of outstanding examples. \u201cYou can find something that looks kind of along the same lines. If you want a pink cactus dahlia, it doesn\u2019t have to be the particular one that I\u2019m showing you.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have favorites. Pressed to name names, she does: yellow, peony-shaped Meadowburn Old Tweet, for instance, and Juanita, a six-inch-across cactus type in rich red. Also Cafe au Lait, the palest peach or barely pink, which is often used in weddings.",
      "Some are extra-flashy, like Bodacious (big, bright orange petals with yellow undersides), Myrtle\u2019s Brandy (distinctive, reflexed red petals with white tips) and Deuil du Roi Albert (purple tipped in white). Bishop of Llandaff has screaming, semidouble scarlet flowers and dark purple foliage.",
      "The list goes on. She always makes room for flowers of velvety black-red (maybe giant Spartacus or smaller Paul Smith) and \u201ca good orange\u201d (Clyde\u2019s Choice can reach a foot across). Pink (perhaps the massive Otto\u2019s Thrill) and white (Walter Hardisty, another big guy) are also musts. At least one color \u2014 yellow, which she once disliked \u2014 has grown on her thanks to her relationship with dahlias.",
      "In each hue, she said, she seeks a range of shapes and sometimes shades, \u201cso that when I\u2019m putting them together in arrangement, you\u2019ve got some nice diversity of form and color and size. If you have a little bit of everything, it\u2019s so easy to put together something that looks abundant.\u201d",
      "Homegrown zinnias and marigolds are among the other ingredients in that abundance; so are copper fennel, nasturtiums and even strands of clematis vine.",
      "One simplifying tactic she suggests if you want get started: Shop according to a color or shape theme.",
      "\u201cIf you like yellow, just get yellow dahlias that are pompons or decorative or cactus,\u201d she said, \u201cso that you have a variation of shape and form. Even if you decided to just do ball dahlias one year, and only had all different colors or sizes of ball dahlias, you would have a fabulous garden.\u201d",
      "Except in Zones 8 to 10, where they are perennials, dahlias tubers are planted outside like annuals, around tomato-transplant time. Ms. Palmer plants hers in mid-May, around Mother\u2019s Day.",
      "There is no room in a greenhouse or under lights to pot up all of those overwintered tubers for a head start, but new mail-order purchases tend to arrive well before it\u2019s safe to put them outdoors and may dry out if left in their boxes. She pots those up, or at least stashes them in a tray of potting soil.",
      "In May, each tomato cage from her giant collection is called into service, gridded out in the gardens along with a stake or two to reinforce it. Beneath each one, a tuber is planted so that an inch or two of soil covers it. A tag marked with the dahlia\u2019s name is tied onto the cage.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing about planting a dahlia tuber is getting your support system in place immediately,\u201d Ms. Palmer said. As the plants grow, she uses biodegradable jute twine for further support, and maybe another stake for the tallest ones. Where cages may look out of place, you can use just bamboo stakes and twine.",
      "Also important: When the first stem pushes up six to 12 inches high, Ms. Palmer pinches the center bud to promote bushiness.",
      "A second pinch, or disbudding, can encourage long stems for cutting. As the plants get ready to produce flowers later on, they form three buds at the end of each branch; pinch off the outer two in each group. Ms. Palmer repeats this as the plants continue to set flowers.",
      "Every couple of weeks throughout the summer, she dilutes fish emulsion with water in a two-gallon sprayer, and \u201cthe roses, the tomatoes, the dahlias \u2014 everybody gets a spray, all over the garden,\u201d she said.",
      "And on they grow, until the first frost. Ideally, Ms. Palmer waits till a week or two after it blackens the plants, and then cuts them back and digs them out. But sometimes frost comes so late she has to dig before it arrives.",
      "She brushes off clods of soil and spreads the tubers out to cure in the barn for a week or so. Then she cuts the stems to maybe two or three inches long, packs the tubers into her cartons with a wood-shaving material from the farm store labeled as horse bedding, and back they go into the cellar.",
      "Oh, but wait: There\u2019s one more step. Don\u2019t forget to tie the tag on the tuber\u2019s stem before you put it away \u2014 if you can keep the exhumed darlings straight, that is.",
      "\u201cAnd I do try,\u201d Ms. Palmer said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a Kafkaesque exercise to tag the tubers with names after I cure them. Thankfully, I don\u2019t really care at the end of the day.\u201d",

It was somewhere in between: some secular, some devout, an unusual blending of two sections of a divided Israeli society that rarely otherwise mix.",
      "Ishay Ribo, 34, is among a crop of young Israeli pop stars from religious backgrounds, some from Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, whose music is attracting more diverse listeners, and featuring prominently in the soundscape of contemporary Israeli life.",
      "This has surprised Mr. Ribo himself.",
      "\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d play to this kind of crowd,\u201d he said, backstage after the show earlier this year at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel, a town in northern Israel originally founded as a collective farm.

      "The religious right has expanded its influence on politics and society, escalating a clash between secular and sacred visions of the country that ",
      ". At the same time, religion has taken on a more prominent, and less contentious, role in the mainstream music scene.",
      "In less than two decades, religious singers have moved from the cultural fringe to widespread acclaim, \u201cnot only among their people, but in all Israel,\u201d said Yoav Kutner, a leading Israeli music critic and radio presenter.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to the words,\u201d Mr. Kutner added, \u201cthey sound like Israeli pop.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo is perhaps the clearest example of this shift. Forgoing the erotic and the profane, his wholesome songs are often prayers to God \u2014 but sung to pop and rock music played by his band of guitarists. ",
      "Cause of causes",
      "he addresses God in one of his biggest hits. \u201cOnly you should be thanked for all the days and nights.\u201d",
      "In 2021, that track, \u201cSibat Hasibot,\u201d was the most played song on Israeli radio stations, religious and secular alike.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of my duty,\u201d Mr. Ribo said in a recent interview. \u201cTo be a bridge between these two worlds.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s journey toward that bridging role began in the early 2000s, on the bus to his religious school.",
      "His family had immigrated from France a few years before. They led an ultra-Orthodox and ascetic life on a settlement in the occupied West Bank, just outside Jerusalem.",
      "The family did not have a television, and Mr. Ribo attended an ultraconservative Jewish seminary. He listened to music on religious radio stations \u2014 often liturgical poems sung in synagogues. He typically heard secular music only on the bus to school, playing from the driver\u2019s radio.",
      "\u201cI had this musical ignorance,\u201d Mr. Ribo said.",
      "At age 11 or so, he began recording simple songs on a portable cassette player. Then as now, his lyrics were infused with piety, Mr. Ribo said. But the tunes were inspired by the mainstream singer-songwriters he\u2019d heard on the school bus.",
      "Some four years later, Mr. Ribo bought a guitar and formed a band with another seminary student. He began to practice and dress as a Modern Orthodox Jew, forgoing the dark coats and wide-brimmed hats of the ultra-Orthodox for jeans and sweaters.",
      "But his awareness of contemporary music and its customs was still patchy. At his band\u2019s first gig, Mr. Ribo played with his back to the audience, unaware of the need to engage with the crowd.",
      "Unlike many Israelis from ultra-Orthodox Jewish backgrounds, he paused his religious studies at age 22 to serve for two years as a conscript in the army. After finishing service in 2013, he tried to build a hybrid musical career \u2014 playing religious music to both secular and devout audiences.",
      "He imagined his melodies might sound like Coldplay, the popular British rock band, but his lyrics, he added, \u201cwould be about God and faith.\u201d",
      "The challenge was that there were few templates then for such a crossover career.",
      "Only a few religious artists, like the folk singer ",
      ", had built a secular following. The most successful religious artists were often those, like Etti Ankri and ",
      ", who had started out secular, became more devout, and then took their original audiences along with them.",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s problem, initially, was that the music industry \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what I had to offer,\u201d he said.",
      "When he sent his music to mainstream record labels, they all turned him down.",
      "Mr. Ribo forged ahead, self-releasing the first of five albums in 2014. He hired a secular manager, Or Davidson, who marketed him as if he was a secular client \u2014 booking him to play at mainstream venues and securing him airtime on nonreligious radio stations. Gradually, his secular fan base expanded.",
      "It was sometimes a fraught balancing act.",
      "Religious Jews criticized him for playing at secular concert halls. Secular Jews opposed his performances at religious venues where men and women sat separately. And when he played to both audiences at secular venues, the staff could not provide kosher food for his religious fans. Even his parents were too religiously observant to attend some of the venues.",
      "But the two-pronged approach ultimately worked. Four of his five albums were classified as gold or above \u2014 selling more than 15,000 copies in the small Israeli market. Secular pop legends, including Shlomo Artzi, began to perform duets with him, and he began to build an audience among diaspora Jews. Later this year, he is scheduled to headline Madison Square Garden, Mr. Davidson said.",
      "To an extent, Mr. Ribo\u2019s appeal is rooted simply in the catchiness of his songs, his clean-cut demeanor and sincere performances.",
      "\u201cEven though I\u2019m secular, I came to watch him because he\u2019s lovely,\u201d said Adiva Liberman, 71, a retired teacher attending his concert at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel.",
      "\u201cNot everyone is paying attention to the lyrics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re just attracted to the melody.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise comes amid not only a political shift rightward in Israel, but demographic changes as well. Religious Israelis, who have ",
      " than secular Israelis, are the fastest-growing part of the population, allowing them to exert greater cultural influence.",
      "Daniel Zamir, an Israeli jazz star who turned religious as an adult, said Mr. Ribo\u2019s broad appeal is part of \u201ca bigger process of Israeli society moving toward tradition.\u201d",
      "Simultaneously, Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise embodies a converse but complementary trend: greater willingness among some religious musicians to cater to and mix with mainstream audiences, and greater demand among religious audiences for music with a more contemporary sound.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca dual process,\u201d Mr. Zamir said. Mr. Ribo is emblematic of \u201cthis new generation that saw that you could be religious and also make great music,\u201d Mr. Zamir added.",
      "For some secular consumers, the rise of \u201cpop emuni\u201d \u2014 \u201cfaith pop\u201d in Hebrew \u2014 has been jarring. \u201cI am not interested in hearing prayers on my radio,\u201d ",

      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s latest song, \u201cI Belong to the People,\u201d also caused discomfort among liberal Israelis. Released in early April, it is an attempt to unite Jews at a time of ",
      " in Israel. But critics said it unwittingly sounded condescending to people from other faiths, implying they were idolatrous.",
      "Mr. Ribo has also caused discomfort within the religious world. Some ultra-Orthodox Jews, particularly their religious leaders, feel he has delved too far into secular society.",
      "Early in his career, Mr. Ribo personally felt so conflicted about this that he sought his rabbi\u2019s approval for his work. To avoid alienating his religious base, there are still some lines he refuses to cross.",

      "That gave Judge Andreas M\u00fcller an opening. Presiding over the courtroom in the traditional black robe and white tie, he immediately threw out the case, citing a youth court statute that encourages rehabilitation rather than punishment.",
      "\u201cMaybe one day, when you\u2019ve had the chance to learn to become an able businessman, you can become a cannabis entrepreneur,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller told the defendant, eliciting chuckles in the courtroom in\u00a0Bernau bei Berlin, a small, picturesque community north of the German capital. The defendant, Justin H., whose surname is protected by Germany\u2019s strict privacy laws, was too stunned to react other than to nod.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller is famous in Germany for his relentless criticism of the law criminalizing cannabis possession. Often with obvious anger in his voice, he has\u00a0argued against Germany\u2019s cannabis law in numerous TV discussion panels; at pro-cannabis demonstrations; in a book; and even in a ",
      ", all while serving as an active judge. In his courtroom, where he hears mainly youth but also adult cases, he has repeatedly thrown out minor possession cases.",
      "\u201cIt makes me so mad to see so many young people locked up and criminalized just because they use cannabis and not alcohol,\u201d he said during a cigarette break at Bernau\u2019s busy municipal court.",
      "Part of his anger arises both from the frequency of cannabis arrests \u2014 181,000 on minor possession or use charges in 2021 \u2014 and the billions of euros spent enforcing what he said was the \u201cabsurd\u201d law against getting high.",
      "In 2020, Judge M\u00fcller wrote the first complaint to Germany\u2019s highest constitutional court, asking it to overturn the cannabis law. Other judges followed, and the court is now reviewing 10 drug cases sent by three different courts in Germany.",
      "\u201cFor young people like us, it\u2019s pretty inspiring to have someone from an older generation, who is a judge, advocate for a thing that maybe goes against conventional opinion,\u201d said the rapper GReeeN, 33, who often sings favorably about cannabis. \u201cIt\u2019s important \u2014 we need people like him for change.\u201d",
      "GReeeN, whose real name is Pasquale Denefleh, knows the judge from a video they made together. The judge, playing himself, raps about the evils of cannabis prohibition. \u201cSmoking weed is not criminal; smoking weed is normal,\u201d he sings.",
      "The German government has begun taking the judge\u2019s side in the cannabis debate just as the judge, 61, is preparing to retire from the bench.",
      "In mid-April, Karl Lauterbach, the country\u2019s health minister, presented a plan legalizing cannabis for personal use; in the coming months, a more comprehensive plan that would eventually legalize and tax the sale of cannabis is expected to be proposed.",
      "After years of a conservative-run government, the new center-left coalition under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, has signaled it is likely to approve the proposal, which would make Germany the first European country where not only the possession but also the public sale of cannabis is not just decriminalized, but legalized.",
      "Although the changes to the law would have come without his help, Judge M\u00fcller and others believe he played a small part in the overhaul.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that he was instrumental in showing that demands for reform were not just coming from the cannabis community, but from a more established perspective, too,\u201d said Ates G\u00fcrpinar, a member of Parliament and the drug policy spokesman for the far-left Die Linke party, which supports legalizing cannabis.",
      "Before the coalition\u2019s latest plan was announced, Judge M\u00fcller had threatened to organize street protests to put pressure on the government.",
      "That pugnaciousness is a signature part of the judge\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cBecause of his rough edges, he\u2019s not just well-known, he\u2019s also feared,\u201d Mr. G\u00fcrpinar said. \u201cHe will just fire off things even if he knows that it could irritate potential allies.\u201d",
      "Judges in Germany wield a lot of power in their courtrooms, but with a few exceptions \u2014 like a judge ",
      " last December \u2014 they tend to stay out of the political fray.",
      "Not so Judge M\u00fcller, who regularly gets into spats on Twitter, where he has 60,000 followers. He also is the deputy director of the German chapter of LEAP, or Law Enforcement Action Partnership, a cannabis advocacy group run by law-enforcement officers, lawyers and politicians.",
      "Some law-enforcement officials say the judge does not\u00a0sufficiently separate his activism from his day job. In 2020 the local district attorney\u2019s office applied to have him recused from hearing cannabis cases. Ricarda B\u00f6hme, a prosecutor, said in an interview that given \u201cthe objective overall view of his public statements\u201d the judge could in \u201cno way be able to reach an unbiased decision\u201d on such matters.",
      "But a higher court ruled for the judge and he was able to continue hearing those cases.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller was born in the town of Meppen in Lower Saxony. His father, traumatized by his experience as an 18-year-old soldier in World War II, drank himself to death when the judge was 11. His brother spent time in jail on a drug charge and died young. Judge M\u00fcller was the first member of his extended family to graduate from high school.",
      "\u201cIt was a present to my mother,\u201d he said about his career choice.",
      "Starting in Bernau as a judge in 1997, Judge M\u00fcller was part of a generation of judges from the former West Germany who came to the former East Germany to help modernize and democratize the judicial system after the collapse of communism.",
      "For all the leniency he has shown in cannabis trials, he has a reputation as an unsparing judge in other cases.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve sent quite a few people to prison,\u201d he said. A tabloid started calling him \u201cJudge Merciless\u201d until he threatened legal action.",
      "Before he became known for his advocacy on cannabis, Judge M\u00fcller was feared among far-right youths for his aggressive stance on prosecuting neo-Nazis.",
      "For a while he declared a specific footwear worn as an identification marker by German neo-Nazi skinheads \u2014 the Dr. Martens 16-eyelet boot with white shoelaces \u2014 a weapon in his courtroom, forcing visitors and witnesses who came wearing the boots to appear in socks. He gave conditional sentences that forced right-wing youth to visit mosques and share meals with immigrants from inner-city districts. He had people visit concentration camps and write essays. He meted out prison sentences for first offenses.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an activist in some ways and has been committed to liberal drug policies for years, but when it comes to other offenses, he\u2019s also known as a strict and uncompromising judge,\u201d said Hasso Suliak, lawyer and an editor at Legal Tribune Online, a German legal news site, who has followed Judge M\u00fcller\u2019s court cases.",
      "All this has made the judge at least a minor celebrity, especially in\u00a0Bernau bei Berlin. A recent packed day of trials in Bernau had to be delayed because Judge M\u00fcller heard a local electrician wanted to meet him.",
      "When he found his admirer, he gave him his latest calling card: a package of cigarette rolling paper with the judge\u2019s own image emblazed on one side and the words \u201clegalize it\u201d printed on the side.",

      ", the leader of North Korea.",
      "Dan-o McShane, as the former U.S. Navy officer is known, had been stationed in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea for six years. Like the rest of the world, he learned of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to meet Mr. Kim in the DMZ on Twitter \u2014 only a day before the meeting was to take place.",
      "Suddenly, the lieutenant commander was thrust into making frantic preparations, his retirement plans scuppered.",
      "\u201cThat started a whole 24-hour communication event that would result in multiple messages passed overnight,\u201d said Commander McShane, who was the American-led United Nations Command\u2019s top military officer at the border in the village of Panmunjom at the time.",
      "\u201cI lay down on the couch for a minute and then at 4 a.m., North Korea would call because they\u2019re working just as hard on their side because Kim Jong-un\u2019s going to come down to them and that\u2019s probably a bigger cult of personality than the Donald Trump cult of personality.\u201d",
      "The Korean War armistice was signed at Panmunjom in 1953, creating\u00a0the DMZ as a buffer between the two Koreas. The U.N. Command and North Korea opened ",
      " as the sole point of contact between the two enemies.",
      "Each side has since assigned a joint duty officer\u200b at Panmunjom to help enforce the cease-fire. On the U.N. side, an American Navy officer has typically served a year or two under the U.N. flag. Commander McShane served for a record eight years, from 2013 to 2021, becoming the longest-serving U.N. joint duty officer at Panmunjom in history. He now teaches guitar to wounded American veterans at Camp Humphreys, south of Seoul, as part of a program sponsored by the American Red Cross and the Wounded Warrior Project.",
      "During that time, he faced off with North Korean troops, prepped for the Trump-Kim summit, saw tensions ebb and flow with the political mood and witnessed some of the most \u200bhair-raising \u2014 and \u200bbizarre \u2014 moments \u200bat the DMZ, the world\u2019s most heavily armed border.",
      "His first night on the job, a land mine exploded nearby. The next night, two went off. Soon, he stopped registering them; the DMZ is strewn with two million land mines. Animals step on them all of the time. It was \u201ca bit of a culture shock,\u201d Commander McShane recalled.",
      "Twice a day \u2014 at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. \u2014 he rang his North Korean\u00a0counterpart on a peach-colored phone the U.N. Command operated to ensure that the hotline was open.\u200b The messages were usually mundane: \u201cWe\u2019re trimming the grass over here. Don\u2019t shoot us!\u201d he said.",
      "Some U.S. soldiers in Panmunjom liked to call themselves the \u201cMerry Mad Monks of the DMZ\u201d because serving in such an isolated, off-limits spot was like living in a monastery. They organized cookouts and teed off at \u201c",
      ": a one-hole, par 3 surrounded on three sides by land mines.",
      "Unfamiliar with Navy abbreviations like LCDR, for lieutenant commander, Army soldiers stationed at the DMZ nicknamed Commander McShane \u201cthe Lord Commander,\u201d a reference to the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "He remembered once spotting a white dog ambling around Panmunjom. He fed and played with it for two weeks until it trotted across the demarcation line\u200b\u200b, \u201clike he\u2019s done it 1,000 times.\u201d",
      "The dog went up the stairs of the gray Stalinist building on the North Korean side. A soldier opened the door and the dog walked right in, never to be seen again. \u201cThe joke was, of course, that he\u2019s a spy,\u201d Commander McShane said.",
      "At Panmunjom, North Korean and U.S. officers occasionally meet in person, even talking baseball. The North Koreans loved Doritos and South Korean Choco Pies, Commander McShane said. The U.N. officers also brought Marlboro cigarettes and Johnnie Walker whiskey as gifts.",
      "But things could also get ugly.",

      " before making it to the South, shot but alive. By then, the hotline was no longer working; the North Koreans had switched it off to protest U.N. sanctions imposed on the country after its third nuclear test in 2013.",
      "After the soldier\u2019s defection, Commander McShane and his \u200byoung \u200btranslator were ordered by his higher-ups to go outside with a bullhorn to deliver a message, standing near the borderline.",
      "It was dark and raining. Earlier that day, \u200bhe had heard \u200ba single gunshot from the North\u200b, likely the sound of \u200ban officer killing himself, knowing his fate for failing to stop the defector, Commander McShane recalled.",
      "Commander McShane used the bullhorn to\u200b invite the North to a joint investigation\u200b of the defection. \u200bBack in his office, \u200bhe saw a \u200bNorth Korean \u200bflashlight blinking\u200b at him\u200b, and he was ordered to go back outside and repeat the message. His translator hid behind a brick wall until she had to repeat the message in Korean.",
      "\u201cThey never replied to that series of messages, but that was the only time I ever felt super unsafe giving a message,\u201d the commander said.",
      "The Navy kept extending Commander McShane\u2019s tour because it had difficulty finding a qualified replacement. A joint duty officer at Panmunjom must be a lieutenant commander with a master\u2019s degree in East Asian studies and rigorous Korean language training. On the day of the Trump-Kim summit, the Navy extended his tour for the fifth time.",

The North Korean \u201cguys are just furious with me,\u201d he recalled. They wondered, \u201c\u2018How can you not have all this American stuff up here?\u2019\u201d",

      "A Marine Corps helicopter had to bring more American flags from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. He used coat hangers for a flag spreader.",
      "Daniel Edward McShane III speaks with a slight Southern accent and calls himself \u201ca little talky.\u201d Born in Charlotte, N.C., in 1970, he joined the Navy in 1999, and flew over Afghanistan and Iraq before being ",

      " with Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president at the time. During a meeting, Ms. Kim, who has served both as a charming emissary and as a foul-mouthed spokeswoman for her brother\u2019s regime, sat next to the commander, laughing and even lightly touching his arm.",
      "Soldiers at Panmunjom would later tease him, calling Ms. Kim his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d",
      "Sadly, Commander McShane said, the inter-Korean d\u00e9tente he witnessed during his times at the DMZ was \u201ctoo short.\u201d Relations between the two Koreas are at their lowest point in years, with North Korea ",
      ".",

Commander McShane\u2019s top boss, U.S. Army Gen. Robert B. Abrams, told\u200b him: \u201cDon\u2019t let that tree die.\u201d (He added that the general was \u201ca little more forceful than that.\u201d)",
      "For a couple months, Commander McShane used a hose to water the tree himself. \u201cIn the DMZ, there are very few things you can point to as a visual kind of containment of hope,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep that thing going.\u201d",

      "ROMA \u2014 Al papa Francisco le gust\u00f3 el plano arquitect\u00f3nico.",
      "\u201cTienen un buen espacio\u201d, le dijo el papa, trazando un cuadrado con las manos durante una audiencia privada el mes pasado, al reverendo Andrew Small, quien gestiona la comisi\u00f3n del papa para combatir los abusos sexuales. \u201c\u00bfYa se mudaron?\u201d.",
      "Desde que Francisco cre\u00f3 la Comisi\u00f3n Pontificia para la Protecci\u00f3n de Menores en 2014, el personal ocupaba, y desbordaba, una antigua residencia del Vaticano cerca del apartamento del papa. Si bien la ubicaci\u00f3n al principio suger\u00eda una proximidad al poder, en la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada la comisi\u00f3n ha visto c\u00f3mo su influencia se ha erosionado debido a los intereses arraigados del Vaticano y las deserciones. Small dijo que su personal deb\u00eda tomar prestadas oficinas en la Santa Sede \u201ccomo beduinos\u201d cuando los obispos se reun\u00edan con ellos. Coment\u00f3 que para los sobrevivientes de abusos era dif\u00edcil encontrar su rinc\u00f3n escondido.",
      "As\u00ed que en a\u00f1os recientes, la comisi\u00f3n busc\u00f3, sin aspavientos, un cambio, aunque fuera un cambio de direcci\u00f3n, para reafirmar lo importante que es para la Iglesia proteger a los ni\u00f1os. La b\u00fasqueda de un lugar termin\u00f3 el mes pasado, cuando la comisi\u00f3n se hizo del control de unas oficinas libre de renta en un majestuoso ",
      " del siglo XVI controlado por la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica en pleno centro de Roma.",
      "La comisi\u00f3n asegura que las nuevas oficinas, de las que hasta ahora no se hab\u00eda informado, en el Palazzo Maffei Marescotti, que se encuentra a unos pasos del Pante\u00f3n, revelan un compromiso concreto con las v\u00edctimas y una clara respuesta a algunas fuerzas del Vaticano que, en su opini\u00f3n, preferir\u00edan que el tema de los abusos sexuales permaneciera oculto o distante.",
      "Lejos de ser un exilio, Small defini\u00f3 el traslado como una expansi\u00f3n hacia una sede mundial en Roma que pueda servir de monumento a \u201cla masacre silenciosa de la infancia de las personas\u201d y dejarles claro a los sobrevivientes que \u201ctienen derecho a estar en un lugar hermoso\u201d.",
      "\u201cEs muy significativo\u201d, dijo en una entrevista Sean O\u2019Malley, arzobispo de Boston y presidente de la comisi\u00f3n.",
      "A pesar de ser \u201cestupendo\u201d haber estado en unas oficinas a pocos pasos del papa, afirm\u00f3, \u201cnos dimos cuenta de que no era tan accesible como nos gustar\u00eda\u201d. O\u2019Malley coment\u00f3 que los sobrevivientes de abusos sexuales por parte de cl\u00e9rigos a menudo se sienten inc\u00f3modos al entrar en una iglesia cat\u00f3lica: \u201cTener que entrar en el Vaticano y pasar por la Guardia Suiza y los gendarmes y todo lo dem\u00e1s puede ser bastante intimidante\u201d.",
      "La ubicaci\u00f3n dista de ser el \u00fanico problema de la comisi\u00f3n. Durante d\u00e9cadas, la Iglesia ha estado polarizada en torno a la asignaci\u00f3n de responsabilidad de su jerarqu\u00eda a la hora de encubrir abusos, a la voz que debe darse a las v\u00edctimas dentro de una instituci\u00f3n herm\u00e9tica y a la conveniencia de adoptar un enfoque m\u00e1s gradual o contundente hacia una reforma.",
      "Francisco anunci\u00f3 la creaci\u00f3n de la comisi\u00f3n en 2013, en medio de preocupaciones de que no tomaba en serio el tema, pero su funci\u00f3n termin\u00f3 siendo solo de consultor\u00eda. Los comisionados, entre los que hab\u00eda algunos sobrevivientes, acabaron renunciando en se\u00f1al de protesta, y acusaron al Vaticano de obstruccionismo.",
      "Con o sin oficinas nuevas, la inestabilidad no ha terminado. El mes pasado, Hans Zollner, jesuita alem\u00e1n, quien tal vez sea el mayor experto de la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica en la lucha contra los abusos y el miembro m\u00e1s destacado de la comisi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n renunci\u00f3.",
      "Cuestion\u00f3 la independencia de la comisi\u00f3n y la ",
      " por no brindar \u201cresponsabilidad, cumplimiento, rendici\u00f3n de cuentas y transparencia\u201d.",
      "\u201cEl padre Hans no estuvo muy presente con nosotros el a\u00f1o pasado, as\u00ed que me sorprendi\u00f3 mucho\u201d, dijo O\u2019Malley sobre la contundente declaraci\u00f3n de Zollner, y a\u00f1adi\u00f3: \u201cNo entiendo cu\u00e1les son sus motivaciones para irse, pero trataremos de entender y abordar sus preocupaciones\u201d.",
      "Cuando se le pregunt\u00f3 al cardenal si pensaba que Zollner, de quien algunos de los miembros de la comisi\u00f3n sospechaban que estaba intentando crear un centro de protecci\u00f3n de menores paralelo en una universidad pontificia romana, intentaba sabotear la comisi\u00f3n, respondi\u00f3: \u201cA estas alturas, no s\u00e9 lo que piensa\u201d (Zollner no respondi\u00f3 a una solicitud de comentarios).",
      "O\u2019Malley prefiri\u00f3 hablar sobre la apertura de las nuevas oficinas de protecci\u00f3n en Sudam\u00e9rica y de las nuevas medidas de rendici\u00f3n de cuentas que Francisco consagr\u00f3 en la legislaci\u00f3n eclesi\u00e1stica el mes pasado.",
      "El cardenal manifest\u00f3 que el papa hab\u00eda aprobado de manera expl\u00edcita la visibilidad que proporcionaba la nueva sede de la comisi\u00f3n en el coraz\u00f3n de Roma, lo que, seg\u00fan O\u2019Malley, deber\u00eda ayudar a \u201cdisipar los temores de que estamos siendo exiliados del Vaticano\u201d.",
      "Sin embargo, encontrar ese espacio no fue tarea f\u00e1cil.",
      "Small, un veterano del Capitolio gracias a su gesti\u00f3n como asesor de pol\u00edtica exterior de la Conferencia Episcopal de Estados Unidos, dijo que para encontrar el lugar adecuado tuvo que recurrir a las lecciones que aprendi\u00f3 en Washington sobre \u201calinear intereses\u201d y respondi\u00f3 a los portazos de rechazo con un decidido: \u201cBueno, ya lo veremos\u201d.",
      "Muchas veces se top\u00f3 con una actitud de rechazo t\u00edpica de la actitud \u201cNIMBY\u201d (acr\u00f3nimo en ingl\u00e9s de \u201cNo en mi patio trasero\u201d), en la que los propietarios de las iglesias ve\u00edan a la comisi\u00f3n \u201ccomo una cl\u00ednica de metadona\u201d.",
      "\u201cNadie la quiere en su patio trasero\u201d, coment\u00f3.",
      "En 2021, Small se encontr\u00f3 con el Palazzo Maffei Marescotti, una propiedad de la Santa Sede fuera del Vaticano que alberga oficinas de caridad, una oficina de correos y la oficina de peregrinaje de la Iglesia. El exdirector de esa oficina, monse\u00f1or Liberio Andreatta, quien est\u00e1 a cargo del edificio, vive en el palazzo y es una figura con buenos contactos y conocida en los c\u00edrculos clericales y pol\u00edticos romanos por su amplia cartera inmobiliaria.",
      "O\u2019Malley le escribi\u00f3 una carta al secretario de Estado del Vaticano en la que indagaba sobre la propiedad u otras ubicaciones adecuadas y tambi\u00e9n recurri\u00f3 al Administraci\u00f3n del Patrimonio de la Sede Apost\u00f3lica, la oficina que se encarga de la gesti\u00f3n de los inmuebles de la Iglesia, que en esencia respondi\u00f3 con un cartel de \u201cno hay habitaciones disponibles\u201d.",
      "Small coment\u00f3 que el equivalente de la alcald\u00eda para la Ciudad del Vaticano tambi\u00e9n le dijo a la comisi\u00f3n que se olvidara de los planes de expansi\u00f3n en las oficinas que ten\u00eda en el Vaticano y les inform\u00f3 que tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan ser desalojados para brindarle espacio a los cardenales que necesitaran alojamiento en caso de que se celebrara un c\u00f3nclave para elegir al pr\u00f3ximo papa (el Vaticano declin\u00f3 hacer comentarios).",
      "Al final, Small afirm\u00f3 que su insistencia y la carta de O\u2019Malley hicieron que Andreatta accediera mostrarles unas peque\u00f1as habitaciones en la azotea del palazzo que Small describi\u00f3 como \u201crepletas de palomas\u201d.",
      "En noviembre pasado, O\u2019Malley fue a realizar una inspecci\u00f3n del sitio y le mostraron una serie de habitaciones en ruinas y con techos altos, que estaban disponibles si la comisi\u00f3n pagaba los costos de su restauraci\u00f3n. Mientras la comisi\u00f3n estudiaba la posibilidad de realizar una campa\u00f1a de recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos, una reorganizaci\u00f3n de la oficina del vicario de Roma llev\u00f3 al obispo Baldassare Reina, un siciliano simpatizante, a ocupar el cargo de vicerregente. Seg\u00fan Small, Reina ejerci\u00f3 m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n sobre Andreatta y consigui\u00f3 que el papa aprobara las nuevas oficinas en unas salas menos grandiosas pero m\u00e1s pr\u00e1cticas, ubicadas al otro lado del pasillo.",
      "\u201cTrabajamos con discreci\u00f3n\u201d, escribi\u00f3 Andreatta en un comunicado, y agreg\u00f3 que las visitas al lugar sirvieron \u201cpara definir mejor las necesidades y la disponibilidad\u201d de la comisi\u00f3n y que \u201ctodo lo dem\u00e1s es una reconstrucci\u00f3n fantasiosa\u201d.",
      "Una tarde reciente, algunos miembros del personal entraron a las oficinas por primera vez. Small pidi\u00f3 con cautela al conserje del edificio que le ense\u00f1ara los espacios comunes del palazzo en el segundo piso.",
      "\u201cPor supuesto\u201d, dijo. \u201cEsta es su casa\u201d.",
      "Detr\u00e1s de la puerta, aguardaban cornisas doradas, frisos pintados de paisajes y escudos de armas, as\u00ed como yeser\u00edas ornamentales de querubines y \u00e1ngeles. Small imagin\u00f3 el espacio como un lugar ideal para organizar eventos de recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos y la sesi\u00f3n plenaria de la comisi\u00f3n en mayo, pero tambi\u00e9n para las intervenciones de las v\u00edctimas, incluidas lecturas de diarios que deber\u00edan ser \u201chonrados y respetados para que aprendamos del pasado\u201d.",
      "Small ten\u00eda dise\u00f1os de una capilla deteriorada del siglo XVI con vidrieras junto a sus oficinas en el piso de arriba, e imagin\u00f3 una capilla sin denominaci\u00f3n para que las v\u00edctimas que hab\u00edan perdido la fe pudieran recuperar alguna medida de espiritualidad, y \u201cno necesariamente a trav\u00e9s de la Iglesia que los lastim\u00f3 tanto\u201d.",
      "Mientras los t\u00e9cnicos del Vaticano llegaban para instalar el acceso a internet en las nuevas oficinas, el personal de la comisi\u00f3n recorri\u00f3 las habitaciones m\u00e1s augustas pero decr\u00e9pitas al otro lado del pasillo, que estaban disponibles para la comisi\u00f3n si lograban renovarlas.",
      "Rosanna Giacometto, una especialista en traumatolog\u00eda de 50 a\u00f1os, revis\u00f3 la gran pantalla plana en la pared en busca de puertos, \u201cHDMI\u201d, afirm\u00f3. \u201cEsto es importante\u201d. A unos metros de distancia, Sheila Kinsey, una veterana de los refugios para abusos sexuales en Estados Unidos, admir\u00f3 la pintura del techo que mostraba caballos m\u00edticos impulsando una carroza y reflexion\u00f3 sobre \u201cintentar descifrar a d\u00f3nde vamos como equipo\u201d.",
      "\u201cTodo el lugar necesita ser recableado\u201d, asegur\u00f3 Emer McCarthy, una funcionaria de la comisi\u00f3n de 46 a\u00f1os, mientras inspeccionaba el cableado expuesto y el moho en el papel tapiz de damasco.",
      "En el nuevo espacio, el personal de la comisi\u00f3n disfrut\u00f3 de la orientaci\u00f3n hacia el sur e imagin\u00f3 un entorno acogedor para las v\u00edctimas, con todo y parrillas en la terraza del otro lado del patio. Small fue m\u00e1s ambicioso.",
      "\u201cNo me sorprender\u00eda si esto nos quedara chico en poco tiempo\u201d, dijo. \u201cY que este se convirtiera en el palacio de los sobrevivientes\u201d.",

      "Estas son las razones por las que los economistas y otros est\u00e1n alarmados por los acontecimientos.",
      "Durante a\u00f1os, la enorme poblaci\u00f3n china en edad laboral impuls\u00f3 el motor econ\u00f3mico mundial, suministrando los trabajadores de las f\u00e1bricas cuya mano de obra barata produc\u00eda bienes que se exportaban a todo el mundo.",

El crecimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n es un impulsor fundamental de la demanda de vivienda, y para muchos chinos, tener propiedad de una vivienda es el activo m\u00e1s importante. Durante los confinamientos pand\u00e9micos generalizados que frenaron el gasto de los consumidores y el crecimiento de las exportaciones, la econom\u00eda de China se volvi\u00f3 a\u00fan m\u00e1s dependiente del debilitado sector de la vivienda.",

El gobierno impuso multas onerosas a la mayor\u00eda de las parejas que ten\u00edan m\u00e1s de un hijo y oblig\u00f3 a cientos de millones de mujeres chinas a abortar.

      "The world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster, unfolding only a few miles away, did not force Halyna Voloshyna, 74, to abandon her home in Chernobyl in 1986.",
      "So when marauding Russian soldiers showed up at her door a little over a year ago, she was not about to let them scare her away, either.",
      "Instead, during the month that Russian forces occupied this polluted patch of earth known as the ",
      ", Ms. Voloshyna was such a thorn in their side that they began referring to her as the \u201cfurious babushka at the end of the lane.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey said they were here to liberate me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cLiberate me from what?\u201d she asked before cursing them.",
      "Ms. Voloshyna is one of 99 longtime residents who still live in the zone, an area that covers roughly 1,000 square miles of some of the most radioactive soil on the planet. The disastrous meltdown at the ",

      "Chernobyl was also one of the first areas Russian tanks rolled through as they swept out of Belarus in the hopes of seizing Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, about 75 miles to the south. And it was one of the first places they were driven out, forced to withdraw at the end of last March.",
      "Visiting the zone a year later, past calamity and current tragedy intersect in strange and fascinating ways.",
      "The meltdown in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, has tainted the land for hundreds of years to come and laid bare the dangers of a political culture built on lies. It contributed to the demise of the Communist system and the collapse of the Soviet Union.",
      "Russia\u2019s invasion was justified with other Kremlin lies: that Ukrainian statehood was a myth, and that Kyiv was ruled by Nazis.",
      "Before the war, ",
      ", once home to tens of thousands of atomic workers before it was abandoned, had become a dark tourist attraction for those drawn to post-apocalyptic desolation. The Soviet-era apartment blocks crumbled as wolves prowled the hallways. A Ferris wheel in an amusement park that was scheduled to open on May 1, 1986, gathered more rust with each passing year.",
      "Visiting the villages around Chernobyl offered a chance to step into a moment frozen in time, with everything left where it was more than three decades ago. Children\u2019s toys sit in yards thick with brush. Tattered clothes are strewn in bedrooms where residents left them as they fled. A dusty cradle glimpsed through a broken window pane offers a reminder that in a now-dead place, there was once new life.",
      "Now, with cities across Ukraine obliterated, the ruins of Chernobyl feel less otherworldly than grimly familiar. Distant explosions set off by animals stepping on mines laid by the Russians are a reminder that this land from the past is very much part of the present.",
      "The confinement building and the hulking sarcophagus built to entomb the remains of Reactor No. 4 \u2014 where two enormous explosions blew the ",
      " off the burning core \u2014 have long served as an object lesson",
      "in what can happen when politics are allowed to interfere with the scientific endeavor of producing energy by splitting the atom.",

      " early on in the war.",
      "On the February 2022 night that the Russians invaded Ukraine, a drastic increase in radiation levels \u2014 from two to eight times more than usual \u2014 was recorded in different parts of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, said Serhiy Kirejev, the Ukrainian official responsible for environmental monitoring there.",
      "\u201cThis is the time when over 5,000 Russian military vehicles entered the zone, drove along the ground roads, and then soldiers started digging the trenches,\u201d Mr. Kirejev said. \u201cThey churned up the radioactive dust that was in the upper layer of the ground.\u201d",
      "Villagers warned the Russians about the dangers.",
      "\u201cThey were digging trenches right close to the reactor,\u201d recalled Halyna Markevych, 82. \u201cWe told them to stop. They said: \u2018Come on. What kind of radiation could there be?\u2019\u201d",
      "Even a quick look at the bunkers the Russians carved out in the most contaminated parts of the zone made clear how careless they had been. The soldiers also set fires and cooked on dirt so radioactive that it made a Geiger counter leap off the charts when tested on a recent visit. There are conflicting reports about whether Russian soldiers fell sick from radiation poisoning.",
      "For the small band of aging residents who remain in the zone, the Russian invasion and the nuclear disaster are catastrophes that bookend their lives.",
      "They recall both events in intimate detail.",
      "Visitors are rare these days, but Ms. Voloshyna was a bundle of energy as she set out a spread of food for her visitors and grabbed a bottle of vodka infused with local herbs. Three shots, she said, was customary for visitors.",
      "Before the meltdown, Ms. Voloshyna said, Chernobyl was a company town known for its great natural beauty. She was 36 and the director of the local kindergarten when the night sky lit up before dawn on April 26, 1986. In the days after the meltdown, she joined other residents in shoveling sand into sacks that were flown by helicopters and dumped in the reactor.",
      "Two plant workers died within hours of the meltdown, and in the months that followed, 28 more people died from radiation poisoning. Though estimates of the total fatalities to date vary widely, ",
      " from cancers and other radiation-associated illnesses.",
      "The evacuation orders came in May, and ultimately around 200,000 people were relocated, according to the ",
      " \u2014 but Ms. Voloshyna was not among them. She hid inside her house after the police ordered residents to leave, even as the authorities sealed her home from the outside.",
      "The next day, she watched as police officers shot all ",
      ". Then the power and water were cut off. But Ms. Voloshyna was determined to stay in the home built by her grandfather more than half a century earlier, nestled on the banks of the Pripyat River.",
      "Unlike when the meltdown happened, the danger from the Russians who stormed in last winter was immediately clear. That night, one resident, Evgen Markevych, 86, put his thoughts down in his diary.",
      "\u201cSorrow came,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are shooting. Putin is like Hitler. Russian troops captured the Chernobyl nuclear station.\u201d",
      "Ms. Voloshyna was determined to stay.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were going for days: a flood of tanks, helicopters and all kinds of shooting all the time.\u201d",
      "One morning, she said, she heard the Russians shouting at a neighbor and ransacking the house. She stormed out to confront them.",
      "\u201cThere were 15 of them with machine guns,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not let them into my house. I started shouting at them.\u201d",
      "Two days later, her neighbor warned Ms. Voloshyna that her two adult sons",
      "were in danger. One of them had earlier served in the Ukrainian military and so would be of particular interest for Russians. ",
      "So under the cover of darkness, the two men crept down to the river bank behind the house, loaded two bicycles onto two little motorboats and set off. They hid for more than a month.",
      "\u201cOnly when the area was liberated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, were they able to come back home,\u201d she said.",
      "The younger of her sons soon left again to join the army. Over the past months he was fighting in Bakhmut.",

      "GAZA CITY \u2014 On the morning of Eid al-Fitr, Arafat Helles will start the day with a special prayer at the mosque to mark the end of Ramadan, and eat a breakfast of salty cheeses to line his stomach for what is to come. Then, he will set out with his three brothers and father across the Gaza Strip.",
      "They will begin with their mother but eventually visit some 15 sisters, aunts and nieces, doling out dinars and shekels as part of a Palestinian custom of men marking the Muslim holiday by giving an eidiya, a gift of money, to female relatives.",
      "The visits will follow an almost choreographed routine. At each home, the men will be plied with coffee and sweets. After little more than 15 minutes, the social calls will end \u2014 a rarity in a society where such visits may last for hours, and often end in an invitation to stay for dinner.",
      "\u201cThis is the eidiya visit,\u201d said Mr. Helles, 48, a professor of social services at Al-Quds Open University, in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our important traditions.\u201d",
      "Giving an eidiya has long been a practice among Muslims \u2014 though it has no religious basis \u2014 and is believed by some to date back 1,000 years to the Fatimid dynasty and the practice of emirs giving gold coins or gifts during festivities.",
      "But in most Muslim cultures, adults give an eidiya to children, sometimes in small, token amounts. Palestinians give the money to both children and adult female relatives, making the tradition far more expensive, with the kind of financial burden and expectations that Christmas gift giving has in the West. The amounts can range from 20 shekels, about $6, to 365 shekels, about $100.",
      "These days, coming up with the money for the eidiya is especially onerous.",
      "The 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt has undermined the living conditions of more than two million Palestinians, and led to a nearly 50 percent unemployment rate that is among the highest in the world.",
      "To give the eidiya, some men will go into debt. Others will wait until their wives get their eidiya from relatives before turning around and using that money to give the gift to their other female relatives.",
      "\u201cHowever bad one\u2019s financial situation is, we have to go and give,\u201d said Mr. Helles\u2019s father, Hamid al-Abid Helles, 74. \u201cThis is a tradition we won\u2019t abandon.\u201d",
      "The practice comes at the end of a month of already added expenses for Ramadan, with the elaborate dinners after daily fasts, and decoration of homes and purchase of new clothes to be worn on Eid. In the weeks leading up to the holiday \u2014 which this year begins on Friday \u2014 shopping districts in Gaza were packed, with seasonal religious music just audible over the din of shoppers and honking horns.",
      "At each relative\u2019s house, Mr. Helles, his brothers and father will be served strong Turkish coffee, Eid date ",
      " and chocolates \u2014 part of the Eid diyafah, or hospitality. They will eat just enough to be polite but remain conscious that at the next stop they will be offered the same spread and encouraged to indulge.",
      "\u201cBy the end we have a stomachache,\u201d said Mr. Helles, a father of six. \u201cWe put all the chocolate in our pockets and tell them we\u2019ll eat it later.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe comes back home and his pocket is bulging with chocolates,\u201d said his wife, Basima Helles, 44.",
      "During each visit, the men will keep an eye on their watches. After 15 minutes, they\u2019ll begin making moves to leave, and call to the women of the house to accept the eidiya. The women, in turn, will protest out of politeness. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no need,\u201d they\u2019ll say. Some will put their hands behind their backs to avoid being handed the money.",
      "To lessen the embarrassment of bills being pressed into palms, shops across Gaza are now offering eidiya cards and small boxes to put the money in, to make the custom feel more like gift giving and less transactional. Some cards mention every female relation that could be on the receiving end of an eidiya: my granddaughter, my wife, my mother-in-law.",
      "Every year Ms. Helles tells her own brother not to give her an eidiya, because she knows that his financial situation is precarious, and that she is one of six sisters.",
      "\u201cWe say, \u2018we forgive you, we excuse you,\u2019 but he\u2019s not willing to come empty-handed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe considers this a social obligation.\u201d",
      "The next day, when women go to visit their families for Eid, she will return the money by giving it as an eidiya to his children.",
      "As the economic situation in Gaza has worsened in recent years, men unable to afford the gift giving have stopped visiting relatives altogether during Eid to avoid embarrassment.",
      "But religious leaders urge men not to abandon a religious obligation \u2014 visiting family \u2014 for the sake of a cultural one \u2014 the eidiya.",
      "That message hasn\u2019t always been heeded.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have an eidiya, it\u2019s better not to go,\u201d said Abdulmutee Matar, 31. \u201cBecause they are accustomed to when you greet them and shake hands, you have money in your hand. If your hand is empty .\u2026\u201d he trailed off, waving his empty hand in the air for emphasis.",
      "He used to give 50 shekels each to his wife, mother, four sisters and eight aunts when he ran his family\u2019s third-generation clothing store. But three years ago, he had to close the shop.",
      "Since then, he has only had occasional work but is still unwilling to give up the tradition. His mother, a teacher, gives him money so he can at least go see his sisters to give the eidiya. He no longer visits his aunts on Eid.",
      "For women, the eidiya can be an extra financial boost.",
      "Last year, Hanadi Tawaahena\u2019s father gave an eidiya to her three sisters and mother but not to her. He told her that was because she had a home baking business and was making her own money.",
      "\u201cThe eidiya is important, even if I work,\u201d said Ms. Tawaahena, 34, last week as she made Eid cookies in a house smelling of ghee and semolina flour. The sweets\u00a0will be part of the diyafah in homes across Gaza. She said it was not just a matter of money, but a matter of principle and being part of a longstanding tradition.",
      "She added with a laugh, \u201cI told him, \u2018Don\u2019t do that again.\u2019\u201d",
      "For other women, it is about the money, and they plan well in advance what to do with their haul, including buying a needed household item or clothes for their children.",
      "Ms. Tawaahena\u2019s sister, Shoroq, 28, was rolling out ground dates to stuff the cookies. She had already made plans with her friends to take their eidiya money and spend it at Gaza City\u2019s boardwalk and restaurants.",
      "\u201cWomen on Eid become rich,\u201d Hanadi Tawaahena said, with another laugh.",
      "Sitting on the other end of the table, rolling out dough, the sisters\u2019 mother, 50-year-old Ashjan, agreed.",
      "\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cthey make the men poor.\u201d"

      "On a recent sunny morning on the banks of the Adda River in northern Italy, schoolchildren on a class trip to Imbersago \u2014 the \u201cTown of the Ferry of Leonardo da Vinci\u201d \u2014 gathered next to a moored boat and listened as a guide explained how the flights of the river\u2019s birds, the formations of its rocks and the workings of its ships inspired Leonardo\u2019s genius.",
      "\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it move?\u201d one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, \u201cService suspended.\u201d It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.",
      "\u201cThe water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,\u201d answered Sara Asperti, 45. \u201cAlso, they\u2019re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.\u201d",
      "Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks\u00a0of the Adda\u00a0belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and ",
      " the motorless ferry around 1513. Later, the invention of the ferry, or its improvement, was attributed to him, though locals say no one knows for sure.",
      "In the past century, reproductions of the original\u00a0ferries have linked Italy\u2019s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.",
      "But a year after Italy\u2019s worst drought in seven decades \u2014 when much of Europe gasped for precipitation \u2014 a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country\u2019s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not Moses,\u201d she responded.",
      "This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls \u201cLeonardesque\u201d ferries has become a stationary landmark.",
      "\u201cIf it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,\u201d said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago\u2019s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was \u201cthe family jewel of the town \u2014 we cannot be left without it.\u201d",
      "The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was \u201cevidence of a global problem.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.\u201d",
      "But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry\u2019s immobility since May.",
      "\u201cBureaucracy,\u201d said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.",
      "Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.",
      "The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn\u2019t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals \u2014 \u201cYou should see the hair on this guy,\u201d he said, cupping the phone \u2014 remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.",
      "\u201cI mean Leonardo wasn\u2019t a moron,\u201d he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s to scale; it\u2019s worth 500 euros,\u201d or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.",
      "\u201cThe force of the ferry is these,\u201d Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.",
      "What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring \u201cThe Human Face of the Ferry\u201d and its pilots over the past century. \u201cHarvard, Harvard, Harvard,\u201d Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. \u201cThey all went to Harvard.\u201d",
      "Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.",
      "\u201cI thought with my license I could do it,\u201d Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo\u2019s sketch and an excerpt from Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d about Charon, \u201cferryman of the damned.\u201d",
      "A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association \u2014 which has the ferry as its logo \u2014 Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really long process,\u201d said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.",
      "In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.",
      "Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant \u201cwe will suffer this summer.\u201d",
      "Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and \u201ckeep the tap closed\u201d to ensure the lake\u2019s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area\u2019s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.",
      "Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where \u201cI found a lot of dead fish.\u201d",
      "Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo\u2019s \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of that is usually covered with water,\u201d Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. \u201cIn 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen the river like this.\u201d",
      "Near Imbersago\u2019s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.",
      "\u201cThere used to be people in the piazza,\u201d he said, as the iron hissed. \u201cThose times are finished.\u201d",
      "Evening fell and the day\u2019s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s months that it doesn\u2019t rain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.\u201d",
      "Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.",

      "BORNE SULINOWO, Poland \u2014 Set in a thick forest, ringed by limpid lakes and free of violent crime, the town of Borne Sulinowo in northwestern Poland has undeniable bucolic charm \u2014 except for the ghosts on every eerily quiet street of the Nazi and then Soviet soldiers who built it.",
      "Governed for the past three decades by Poland, the town was controlled by and part of Germany before World War II; seized by the Red Army in 1945; and occupied by Moscow\u2019s forces until 1992. For a time, it embraced its dark side, eager to attract visitors and money to a forlorn and formerly forbidden zone so secret it did not appear on maps.",
      "Military re-enactors, including enthusiasts from Germany and Russia, visited each year to stage a parade, dressed in Soviet and Nazi uniforms, which are banned from public display in Germany.",
      "A Polish businessman opened the Russia Hotel, decorating it with photographs of himself and a friend dressed in Russian military uniforms and with communist-era banners embroidered with images of Lenin. His other ventures in the town included a cafe named after Rasputin and boozy, Russia-themed corporate events.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion of Ukraine stopped all that. Kitsch became offensively creepy.",
      "\u201cEverything changed very quickly,\u201d said Monika Konieczna-Pilszek, the manager of the Russia Hotel and daughter of its founder. Online reviews, she said, suddenly went from \u201ccommenting on our food to talking about burning us down.\u201d",
      "She told her father they had to change the name. \u201cInstead of attracting people it was repelling them,\u201d she said. The inn is now called the Borne Sulinowo Guesthouse. A big Soviet banner hung in the hallway next to its restaurant has been turned round so Lenin is no longer visible.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to be reminded of Russia these days,\u201d Ms. Koniecnza-Pilszek said.",
      "Dariusz Tederko, a local official responsible for promoting the town, lamented that the war in Ukraine \u201chas turned everything upside down.\u201d The military re-enactors, he said, are no longer welcome. The Russians couldn\u2019t come anyway because of a government ban.",
      "Trying to draw more Poles and Western Europeans, he now promotes the town\u2019s less triggering charms. \u201cWe have lots of beautiful heather,\u201d he said, waving a brochure with pictures of hiking trails and wildflowers.",
      "But he misses the prewar days when Russia was \u201cnot so sensitive,\u201d and Borne Sulinowo did not have to feel ashamed about the one thing that set it apart from countless other places in Poland offering pleasant scenery and pretty flowers.",
      "He said he was still in touch with retired Russian soldiers, including one now working in the Kremlin, who served here during the Cold War and who used to return regularly for trips down memory lane.",
      "Unlike many Poles, residents of Borne Sulinowo often harbor little personal animosity toward Russians. They are appalled by the bloodshed in Ukraine but blame Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.",
      "During the Soviet era, the town \u2014 home to more than 10,000 soldiers of the Northern Group of Forces \u2014 was a world unto itself, scrubbed from maps and off limits to Poles without special entry passes, though many still sneaked in to buy food and vodka.",
      "Renata Szmurlo, a nurse who grew up in a Polish town near the Soviet zone and moved to Borne Sulinowo with her family after the Russians left, recalled a carefree youth of cycling past military checkpoints with her friends to visit the town\u2019s shops. They accepted Polish currency but, stocked with supplies from Moscow for Soviet officers, had more goods than Polish ones.",
      "\u201cThe Russians were great guys,\u201d she recalled.",
      "When the town was part of Germany, Hitler visited, arriving by train in 1938 to inspect what was then a secret military training ground, set up in the forest so that Nazi commanders could furtively practice the blitzkrieg tactics that, just a year later, would plunge Poland and then the rest of Europe into World War II.",
      "\u201cIf you just look at the trees and buildings, everything here looks OK, but if you know the history of this place it makes your skin crawl,\u201d said Dariusz Czerniawski, a former teacher who moved to Borne Sulinowo shortly after the last Russians pulled out. They left a ghost town of empty, dilapidated barracks, suddenly silent shooting ranges and fields rutted with tank tracks.",
      "After a year under the control of the Polish army, Borne Sulinowo reappeared on maps in 1993 as just another Polish town, inhabited by a few early pioneers like Mr. Czerniawski. \u201cIt was so quiet, I wanted to scream,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe silence and emptiness were terrifying.\u201d",
      "Over time, more Poles arrived, attracted by cheap housing and the chance for a fresh start. The town now has nearly 5,000 year-round residents and many more people during the summer. It still feels empty and isolated.",
      "The main road \u2014 Adolf Hitler Strasse during the Nazi period and Stalin Avenue after 1945 \u2014 is now Independence Street.",
      "Lined with gimcrack Soviet apartment blocks intermingled with sturdy villas left by the Germans, it has a few shops, a defunct pizza place and the Sasha Cafe, run by a Russian-speaking man from eastern Ukraine, who first came here as a young photographer working for the Soviet military command.",
      "A target of suspicious whispering by locals and scrutiny by Polish authorities, he recently put his property up for sale.",
      "Mr. Czerniawski, the early pioneer, today runs the town\u2019s museum and has spent a lot of time thinking about how to deal with the past.",
      "\u201cIt would perhaps be easier to demolish the whole town,\u201d he said, \u201cBut what would that give us \u2014 just a big empty space with no memory of anything?\u201d",
      "Borne Sulinowo, he believes, needs to survive as a \u201cunique place built by the two most brutal totalitarian systems of the last century\u201d \u2014 and as a reminder of where such systems lead. \u201cUsually to war,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe have to remember our bad past so that we can learn something for the future,\u201d he said.",
      "He has resisted suggestions to remove from the museum a mannequin dressed in a Russian military uniform and has rejected demands that the Soviet-designed tank opposite the entrance be taken away. Some residents threatened to destroy it.",
      "But the tank, Mr. Czerniawski noted, was put there",
      "by Polish authorities, who took it from a Warsaw military museum. \u201cIt is Soviet design but was made in Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is part of our history \u2014 perhaps not the glorious history we would like \u2014 but it is ours,\u201d he said.",
      "The most sinister reminders of Moscow\u2019s former hegemony \u2014 concrete bunkers housing nuclear warheads \u2014 have mostly been swallowed up by the forest near Brzeznica-Kolonia, a village 19 miles south of town.",
      "\u201cEntry Categorically Forbidden. Danger of death or disability,\u201d read signs put up in front of the crumbling, weed-clogged bunkers.",
      "Until the warheads were taken back to Russia in 1990 as the Soviet Union unraveled, they were part of the Vistula Program, a top-secret deployment of nuclear weapons in Poland that began in the 1960s. Throughout the Cold War, Moscow insisted it had no nuclear weapons in Poland while accusing the United States of threatening peace by putting its own warheads in Europe.",
      "For Jan Chmielowski, a Pole who first visited Borne Sulinowo in 1994 and \u201cimmediately fell in love with this strange place,\u201d the Soviet past was for years \u201cjust a big sad joke\u201d because everything left by the Russians seemed to be falling apart.",
      "He bought an old German villa, turned it into a guesthouse and, inspired by the Russia Hotel next door, began organizing corporate team-building events featuring vodka, surly Soviet-style service and mock arrests by fake Russian officers with guns. He has dropped that and now organizes French-themed events with champagne and without weapons.",
      "\u201cEverything Russian stopped being funny after the war in Ukraine,\u201d he lamented."

      "With the battle for control of Sudan entering its third week, health care services are rapidly unraveling in the nation\u2019s capital, Khartoum, a grim consequence of the brutal fighting that has raised fears the conflict could devolve into a wider humanitarian crisis.",
      "The total collapse of the health care system could be days away, the Sudan Doctors\u2019 Trade Union warned.",
      "Hospitals have been shelled, and two-thirds of those in Khartoum have closed, according to the World Health Organization. More than a dozen health care workers have been killed, officials say. Beyond that, \u201chidden victims\u201d are dying of illness and disease as basic medical services have become",
      "scarce, said Dr. Abdullah Atia, secretary general of the doctors\u2019 union.",
      "\u201cWe receive a lot of calls every day: \u2018Where shall I go?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the questions we are not able to answer.\u201d",

      " The latest truce to allow civilians to escape was to end at midnight on Sunday, and though the Rapid Support Forces said it would extend a humanitarian cease-fire for three more days, fighting was reported in the capital.",
      "The Sudanese Army agreed in a statement on Sunday to extend the truce, but it has accused the Rapid Support Forces of violating the truce and of occupying a hospital. The R.S.F., in turn, has said the army has been looting medical supplies.",
      "In response to the worsening situation, the United Nations secretary general\u2019s office said it was \u201cimmediately\u201d sending Martin Griffiths, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, to Sudan.",
      "\u201cThe scale and speed of what is unfolding is unprecedented in Sudan,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary general, said in a ",

      "Other nations have ",

      " have fled in long convoys of buses, trucks and cars heading to Egypt to the north or to Port Sudan, where they hope to board ships to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. ",
      "The State Department said on Sunday that a second convoy of U.S. citizens had arrived in Port Sudan, bringing the number of evacuated Americans to just under 1,000. The department added that fewer than 5,000 Sudanese citizens had sought the U.S. government\u2019s help via a \u201ccrisis intake\u201d ",
      " set up for Americans and their families. About 16,000 Americans live in Sudan, many of them dual citizens.",
      "Sudan\u2019s Health Ministry is nowhere to be found, with the doctors\u2019 union saying it had received no support and little communication from the government. Health facilities have been used by fighters as defensive positions, witnesses and officials say.",
      "What\u2019s more, the paramilitary forces have occupied the national laboratory, officials say. Samples of diseases like malaria or tuberculosis could become weaponized in the wrong hands, said Dr. Atia, who, like others, spoke by phone from Khartoum.",
      "Uncollected bodies in morgues and others in the street are another concern, he added. The doctors\u2019 union later said in ",
      "hat the number of bodies scattered on the streets was growing, creating \u201can environmental catastrophe.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of doctors have fled, and there are rumors that fighters with the Rapid Support Forces are kidnapping medics and forcing them at gunpoint to treat their wounded comrades. While the abductions have not been confirmed, Dr. Atia said, dozens of members of the Sudan Doctors\u2019 Trade Union are unaccounted for.",
      "The shortage of health care workers has left hospitals with barely enough staff to cope. Al Ban Jadid hospital in east Khartoum usually has a staff of at least 400 people but now has only eight health care workers. Al Joda Hospital in southern Khartoum is hobbling along with four people: a surgeon, an anesthetist and two nurses, Dr. Atia said.",
      "Some nongovernmental organizations have offered a glimmer of hope. Doctors Without Borders said it had ",
      " to three hospitals in Khartoum, while the International Committee of the Red Cross announced on Sunday that ",
      " to Port Sudan from Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cHealth care workers in Sudan have been doing the impossible, caring for the wounded without water, electricity and basic medical supplies,\u201d Patrick Youssef, the Red Cross\u2019s regional director for Africa, said in a statement.",
      "The Sudan doctors\u2019 union issues a notice on Facebook several times a day listing the few hospitals still operating in Khartoum, or an urgent alert for doctors to report to the field hospitals set up in homes across the city.",
      "Away from hospitals, medical staff must use whatever tools they can find to treat the wounded.",
      "In a field hospital in Al Mamoura, Dr. Mohamed Karrar improvised an intercostal drain system using a sterilized soda bottle to pump the blood from a gunshot victim\u2019s punctured lung. Long shifts in the trauma ward of the now-shuttered Ibrahim Malik Teaching Hospital in central Khartoum helped prepare him, but Dr. Karrar must now contend with the sound of war while working in a living room converted into an operating room.",
      "\u201cI know I\u2019m in danger in these areas,\u201d he said, \u201cbut those sick, wounded people need me.\u201d",
      "At Al Nada, medical workers and their patients take cover multiple times a day under beds and tables, hiding from aerial bombardments and heavy artillery fire. Everyone is so jittery, said a doctor there, Mohamed Fath, that the sound of an oxygen canister being opened can send staff fleeing.",
      " Early in the conflict, the management at Al Nada, a private facility, decided to treat only pregnant women and children in order to provide a haven for a small fraction of the more than 24,000 women who, according to the W.H.O., are expected to give birth in Sudan in the next few weeks.",
      "In the weeks since the fighting began, 220 babies have been born there, and most have survived, Dr. Fath said.",
      "One woman sped through active combat zones and barely made it to the emergency room, he said. Later, her husband showed Dr. Fath the bullet holes in his car. Another woman gave birth at home, but because of complications the baby needed urgent medical care. The mother and child were trapped in their home for days with artillery fire whizzing overhead, the doctor said. When they finally made it to the hospital, it was too late for the infant, who died.",
      "\u201cThey have to go through this hell to get to the hospital,\u201d Dr. Fath said.",
      "Neighbors seeking care have taken to ringing Dr. Fath\u2019s doorbell at home. Twice last week, he said, he pronounced two people dead in Omdurman Althawra, north of the city. Both were diabetics who ran out of insulin in a city where pharmacies have been ransacked and a medical black market is thriving.",
      "Now, the doctor said, he spirits home medicine hidden in his car. But in neighborhoods that can quickly turn from ghost towns to active war zones, even the mile-long trip between the hospital and his home can imperil his life.",
      "Before the war, Dr. Fath was filling out application forms to work in hospitals in South Africa, where he planned to specialize in pediatric neurology. But he and his wife, also a doctor, whose final exam was set for May 6, made the decision to stay.",

      "An attack on an oil depot in Russian-occupied Crimea that sparked a huge fire and sent a plume of black smoke billowing into the sky was part of Ukraine\u2019s preparations for a counteroffensive, a Ukrainian military spokeswoman said on Sunday.",
      "The fire early Saturday in the city of Sevastopol, the home to the Russian Navy\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, is the latest example of what looks to be the next phase of a conflict that has for months been marked by bitter fighting, crawling advances and deadly shelling along the front line and across the border between the two countries.",
      "The depot fire, according to the spokeswoman for Ukraine\u2019s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, is part of preparations for \u201cthe broad, full-scale offensive that everyone expects.\u201d She told Ukrainian television on Sunday that it was crucial to target Russia\u2019s logistical capacity ahead of the counteroffensive. Russian officials blamed the explosion on a drone attack that managed to reach far beyond the front lines of the fighting.",
      "A little more than 24 hours later, Russian forces demonstrated their own ability to hit targets well inside opposing territory. Pavlograd, a city far from the front lines in central Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region, was rattled by explosions, according to reports from social media and the city\u2019s mayor, Anatoly Vershina.",
      "Videos and photos shared on social media and reviewed by The Times appeared to show the aftermath of a large explosion inside the city. Several images also showed what appeared to be secondary explosions. Local Telegram channels shared photos of shattered windows and damage to homes following reports of an explosion. It was unclear if there were casualties. Hours later, air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine and officials warned residents to take cover from possible Russian missile strikes.",
      "Russia has been able to launch deadly strikes far from the front lines, including an aerial assault on Friday that killed more than two dozen people. But it has been unable to break through the Ukrainian defenses in the east, making only small gains as both sides have sustained heavy casualties.",
      "That has given Ukraine hope for a coming counteroffensive, with a belt of land just north of Crimea viewed as a likely target. Russia has held that territory, in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions along the coast of the Sea of Azov, since shortly after the invasion.",
      "The tempo of strikes in Crimea and in cities such as Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region has increased in recent weeks, a potential sign of their importance to a coming counteroffensive that is set to be powered by fresh supplies of advanced Western military equipment, including tanks and armored personnel carriers that have already arrived in the country.",
      "While President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says that reclaiming Crimea is a national priority, Ukrainian officials and military experts say that it is highly unlikely that the peninsula would be the immediate target of the coming campaign. Crimea is well behind Russian lines, and Russia has been attempting to strengthen its defenses along the coast, laying land mines and building obstacles to slow tanks.",
      "Ukraine and Russia have both taken heavy casualties in hard-fought ground campaigns in the Donbas region, particularly around the city of Bakhmut, and the country\u2019s south and east are believed to be the most likely theaters for Ukraine\u2019s coming offensive. But shelling has remained a fixture in the daily lives of civilians from both countries in regions far from the most intense fighting.",
      "On Sunday, four civilians were killed when Ukrainian shelling hit a Russian village close to Ukraine\u2019s northeastern border, according to the governor of the Bryansk region, Alexander Bogomaz. Two people were also injured when several rockets struck the village of Suzemka, about six miles from the border with Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region.",
      "Sumy has itself been a frequent target of Russian shelling in recent months, and the regional military administration said on Sunday that Russian forces had fired a total of 57 shells on nine communities overnight, although no injuries were reported.",
      "Ukrainian officials did report two civilian deaths from Russian shelling on Sunday, both in the country\u2019s south. Shelling killed a woman and injured a man in the Kherson region, where Russia has been targeting territory that Ukrainian forces recaptured last fall, and one person was killed and two wounded in Nikopol, in the Dnipropetrovsk region.",
      "Neither country\u2019s claims of civilian casualties could be independently verified.",
      "President Biden, speaking at the annual White House Association Correspondents\u2019 dinner on Saturday, said the United States is \u201cworking every day\u201d to secure the release of Evan Gershkovich, an American Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia.",
      "Mr. Gershkovich was detained in Russia last month and accused of espionage, a charge that his employer and the United States emphatically reject. The State Department this month designated the journalist as \u201cwrongfully detained,\u201d signifying that the U.S. government sees him as the equivalent of a political hostage.",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Biden spoke of Mr. Gershkovich\u2019s \u201cabsolute courage\u201d and said everyone at the event stood with the reporter. \u201cOur message is this: Journalism is not a crime,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Gershkovich\u2019s case represents the most significant attack on international journalists in Russia since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion. It is also the first time that a Western journalist in Russia has been charged with espionage since the end of the Cold War.",

Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry did not directly announce his removal or say what he would do next. Instead, it simply said that Col. Gen.

      "President Yoon Suk Yeol went to Washington to reset South Korean diplomacy by drawing closer to the United States and taking a larger role on the international stage. If the warmth of his reception there was the gauge of success, he did well.",
      "President Biden welcomed him as \u201cmy friend.\u201d Mr. Yoon belted out \u201c",
      " while the crowd whooped along during the White House dinner. On Thursday, he ",
      " the United States Congress, thanking Americans for their support during the Korean War, and extolling a deep relationship between the countries that helped energize South Korea\u2019s rise to become a global technological and cultural powerhouse.",
      "\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t know my name, you may know BTS and Blackpink,\u201d Mr. Yoon said to chuckles from American lawmakers. \u201c",
      ". But I beat them to Capitol Hill.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Yoon now returns home to South Korea to a decidedly colder audience \u2014 a public that has punished him with low approval ratings and, in some sectors, has deep misgivings over a pivot toward the United States that could alienate China and threaten the country\u2019s long tradition of diplomatic caution.",
      "Even before Mr. Yoon departed for Washington, South Koreans \u200bwere beginning to grapple with questions that seemed distant until recently. How can they feel safe under the rapidly expanding nuclear threat from North Korea\u200b? And how should they navigate the increasingly bitter rivalry between the United States, South Korea\u2019s main military ally, and China, its biggest trading partner\u200b?",
      "\u200bThe main answer Mr. Yoon is bringing home is the \u201c",
      ",\u201d a joint statement with Mr. Biden. In it, Mr. Biden promised that Washington would embrace South Korea as a close consultative partner in its nuclear strategy over the Korean Peninsula \u2014 though American presidents will remain the sole authority on whether to actually use nuclear weapons.",
      "To show its \u201cextended deterrence\u201d commitment to defend its ally with nuclear weapons if necessary, Mr. Biden \u200bpromised that U.S. nuclear ballistic missile submarines would make port calls \u200bin South Korea for the first time in decades. In return, Mr. Yoon reaffirmed South Korea\u2019s intention not to develop nuclear weapons of its own, dispelling misgivings in Washington that he might consider a nuclear option, as he ",
      " he might early this year.",
      "But like everything else Mr. Yoon has done since his election last year, the reviews in South Korea were polarized.",
      "\u201cHistory will remember the Yoon government as the first South Korean administration to recognize the North Korean nuclear program as a present and urgent threat and begin preparing responses to the crisis,\u201d said Cheon Seong-whun, a former head of the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.",
      "The Washington Declaration \u200bwas \u201ca big win\u200b\u201d\u200b for South Korea\u200b because \u201cfor the first time, the allies are discussing nuclear deterrence, which Seoul has not been able to discuss with Washington until now\u200b,\u201d said Kim Duyeon, a Seoul-based researcher for the Center for a New American Security.",
      "\u200b \u201cThey are gaming out scenarios in which not only North Korea might use a nuclear weapon but the U.S. would direct the employment of a nuclear weapon in response as well,\u201d Ms. Kim said\u200b. \u200b\u201cThis is huge because until now, the tabletop exercises would end before Washington decides to use a nuclear weapon. The U.S. had considered such information to be too classified to share and because nuclear use would be a U.S. decision, operation and execution plan.\u200b\u201d",
      "Mr. Yoon\u2019s critics at home, however, felt he was giving away too much for too little, seeing the declaration and a separate joint \u200bstatement from Mr. Yoon and Mr. Biden as a carefully wrought design to silence calls for South Korea\u2019s own nuclear force or the redeployment of American tactical nuclear weapons in the South.",
      "Such calls have gained momentum in recent months, as North Korea has stoked nuclear jitters in the South by testing a series of what it called nuclear-capable short-range ballistic missiles. \u200bThe North has also \u200bwarned \u200bthat \u200bfirst nuclear strikes were now part of its military strategy.",
      "\u201cThe Washington Declaration may look substantive and fantastic, but, in reality, it is an empty shell,\u201d ",
      " Professor Kim Dong-yub, at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. \u201cThere is no change in Washington policy.\u201d",
      "Critics also \u200b\u200bdoubted that \u200bthe \u200bport calls\u200b \u200bby U.S. nuclear submarines \u200bwould do much more than further escalate regional tensions with China and North Korea and\u200b provide another excuse for the North to \u200bexpand its nuclear arsenal. On Saturday, North Korea called Mr. Yoon \u201ca fool\u201d and Mr. Biden \u201can old man with no future\u201d and said it felt\u00a0compelled to take \u201cmore decisive action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not \u2018extended deterrence,\u2019 but rather \u2018extended crisis,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kim said.",
      "An editorial in the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo sounded miffed by \u200bwhat\u200b it called \u200bthe Biden administration\u2019s \u200befforts to \u201ctighten the nuclear shackle\u200bs\u200b\u201d on its ally.",
      "\u201cThe declaration seems to put more emphasis on American concerns that South Korea could develop its own nuclear weapons than on the North Korean nuclear threat that prompts such aspirations,\u201d it said. \u201cUltimately, South Korea must be in a position to defend itself.\u201d",
      "For decades, South Korea\u2019s defense strategy relied on the assumption that the United States would come to its aid if war were to break out. But the once-bedrock premise is losing its credibility\u200b. In a survey by the Seoul-based Chey Institute for Advanced Studies late last year, \u200bn\u200bearly 49 percent of respondents said they doubted that Washington would fight for South Korea at the risk of a North Korean nuclear attack on mainland United States.\u200b Nearly 77 percent said South Korea needed to develop its own nuclear arsenal.",
      "\u200bTo such skeptical South Koreans, Washington\u2019s \u200bpromise of extended deterrence \u201cjust amounts to rhetoric, however you package it,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul.",
      "Many South Koreans remain wary of great powers, reflecting their deep grievances over Japanese colonial rule and the division of the Korean Peninsula by the Soviet Union and the United States at the end of World War II.",
      "South Korea \u200bhas \u200b\u200bkept Japan at arm\u2019s length, even though Washington urged its two key allies to work closely together to deter China and North Korea. It has \u200b\u200balso sought diplomatic balance between Washington and Beijing. Its more progressive leaders\u200b, like Mr. Yoon\u2019s predecessor, ",
      ", doggedly pursued dialogue with North Korea, even \u200bcausing friction with Washington, which tended to emphasize sanctions\u200b.",
      "Mr. Yoon, however, has made a point of ",
      " the \u200btraditional equilibrium.",
      "\u200bIn March, he ",
      " a logjam in relations with Japan by promising that Seoul will no longer seek compensation for victims of forced labor during Japan\u2019s colonial rule\u200b. Mr. Yoon also doggedly aligned Seoul more closely with \u200b\u200bthe United States, despite concerns about China\u2019s ability to harm South Korea\u2019s vital economy.",
      "\u201cThe alliance has now become a global alliance that safeguards freedom and peace around the world,\u201d he told the U.S. Congress. \u201cKorea will fulfill its responsibilities.\u200b\u201d\u200b",
      "While in Washington, Mr. Yoon condemned the war against Ukraine as \u201ca violation of international law\u200b.\u200b\u201d In a jab at Beijing, he \u200bopposed \u201cany unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the Indo-Pacific, including through unlawful maritime claims, the militarization of reclaimed features and coercive activities.\u201d",
      "Liberal South Koreans cautioned against Mr. Yoon\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cIf South Korea is unilaterally sucked into the new U\u200b.\u200bS\u200b.\u200b-led Cold War system, it must face up to the reality that relations with China and Russia, both of which have a strong influence on North Korea, will become more dangerous, and the risk of a North Korean nuclear crisis and even war on or around the peninsula will increase,\u201d the liberal Hankyoreh newspaper said.",
      "\u200bBoth hawks and doves in policy circles in Seoul will have reason to feel disappointed by the Washington Declaration, which \u201cneither signals a push for dialogue with Pyongyang nor promises Seoul getting a nuclear deterrent of its own,\u201d said John Delury, an East Asia scholar at Yonsei University in Seoul.",
      "But to many South Koreans, especially younger \u200bgenerations struggling with \u200bdwindling job opportunities, a \u200bmore pressing issue than the North\u2019s nuclear\u200b arsenal is the economy.",
      "In recent months, hardly a day \u200bhas gone by in South Korea without headlines blaring concern that Mr. Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction and Chips and Science Acts would hurt two of South Korea\u2019s \u200bmost important industries: electric cars and semiconductors. But in their joint statement, Mr. Yoon and Mr. Biden \u200bonly agreed to \u201ccontinue close consultations.\u201d\u200b",
      "\u201cYounger Koreans don\u2019t know the lyrics to \u2018American Pie,\u2019 but they know about the Inflation Reduction Act,\u201d Mr. Delury said."

    "author": "Jason Horowitz",
    "publication_date": "2023-04-30T17:22:25-04:00",

      "BUDAPEST \u2014 Pope Francis said on Sunday that the Vatican was involved in a secret \u201cmission\u201d to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine and that it would do \u201call that is humanly possible\u201d to return children taken from Ukraine to Russia and reunite families.",
      "The pope\u2019s remarks to reporters aboard the papal plane returning from a three-day trip to Budapest did not specify what the \u201cnot yet public\u201d mission entailed. But Francis said he had privately discussed the situation with both Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and with the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church in Budapest, Metropolitan Hilarion.",
      "\u201cIn these meetings we did not just talk about Little Red Riding Hood,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWe spoke of all these things. Everyone is interested in the road to peace.\u201d",
      "Though Mr. Orban leads a country that is a member of both NATO and the European Union, his position on the war has often been at odds with the rest of Europe. He has opposed sending military aid to Ukraine and imposing international sanctions against Russia.",
      "Early in the war, the pope was reluctant to name Russia as the aggressor, in part because he hoped that keeping the Vatican\u2019s traditional neutrality could put him in a position to broker a cease-fire or peace. But questions about his failure to call out Russia\u2019s invasion, and pressure from Ukraine, eventually led him to condemn Russia. He has compared Russia\u2019s behavior to massacres under Stalin and has consistently supported Ukrainians and called attention to their plight.",
      "But Francis, who said the Vatican had previously played a role in facilitating prisoner swaps between the sides, now seeks to be a protagonist in a peace process. As the war enters its 15th month, both the Russians and Ukrainians are preparing spring offensives and few believe a negotiated peace is imminent.",
      "\u201cI think that peace is always made by opening channels,\u201d said the pope, who on Thursday met with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal of Ukraine, with whom Francis said he had also discussed a \u201cpeace formula.\u201d Mr. Shmyhal asked for the pope\u2019s help with the return of Ukrainian children taken to Russia, a practice the International Criminal Court last month called a war crime.",
      "The court issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Russia\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, who has characterized the movement of the children as a humanitarian operation.",
      "On the flight, Francis, 86, also discussed the ailment that forced him to be rushed to the hospital last month, which he called an \u201cacute and strong\u201d pneumonia.",
      "\u201cI felt a strong pain\u201d at the end of a public audience with the faithful on March 29, he said. \u201cI did not lose consciousness, but I had a high fever.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe body responded well to the treatment, thank God,\u201d the pope added, saying he intended to keep traveling.",
      "Francis began the last day of this trip with the same theme he stressed when it began on Friday: inclusivity. In remarks in front of Mr. Orban, the European Union leader with the most hard-right and anti-immigrant stance, the pope urged his flock to welcome foreigners and migrants and to \u201cbecome open doors\u201d that are \u201cnever shut in anyone\u2019s face.\u201d",
      "Francis celebrated a large, open-air Mass against the backdrop of the spired Parliament building on the banks of the Danube River. Tens of thousands of faithful, many holding Hungarian and Vatican City flags, crammed into the surrounding streets, watching via jumbo screens and listening to Francis through booming speakers.",
      "\u201cHow sad and painful it is to see closed doors,\u201d the pope said. \u201cThe closed doors of our selfishness with regard to others; the closed doors of our individualism amid a society of growing isolation; the closed doors of our indifference towards the underprivileged and those who suffer; the doors we close towards those who are foreign or unlike us, towards migrants or the poor.\u201d",
      "But some in the crowd thought he was not talking about Hungary, or about migrants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a more global message: He is talking about closed doors because he can\u2019t go to Ukraine,\u201d said Balazs Baksa, 43, a computer technician from Budapest who attended with his wife and two small children. He said Mr. Orban \u2014 with whom, Mr. Baksa said, \u201cI fully agree\u201d \u2014 was open to legal migrants, like his Indian and Pakistani and African colleagues and friends.",
      "But Mr. Orban, he said, understands Hungary\u2019s history of Ottoman invasion and that \u201cthe situation is the same now: They want to get into Europe through Hungary.\u201d Mr. Baksa added that it was left to Mr. Orban to \u201csave\u201d the European Union.",
      "Others in the crowd thought Hungary\u2019s politicians should consider the pope\u2019s words.",
      "Marcell Bednarik, 48, who also prayed with his family at the Mass, said he had heard in the homily \u201ca more generic\u201d speech, one that urged him to be a better neighbor, but that the government should try to be more welcoming, too. While he said he agreed with Mr. Orban on issues like the centrality of the family, \u201cif I consider myself a Christian, I can\u2019t cherry-pick the Christian values I like,\u201d and so he believed that the country needed to be more inclusive to migrants.",
      "Then again, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the responsibility of running a country.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, Francis greeted some of the 2.5 million refugees who have poured across the Ukrainian border and into Hungary since Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine began in February 2022, though only about 35,000 remain. In St. Elizabeth\u2019s Church that day, he told the faithful, \u201cThank you, too, for having welcomed \u2014 not only with generosity, but also with enthusiasm \u2014 so many refugees from Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Then Francis met privately with Metropolitan Hilarion, whose church, critics say, has sought to give religious legitimacy to Mr. Putin\u2019s invasion.",
      "The Hungarian government has sought to cast Mr. Orban and Francis as like-minded on the war, with both having called for a cease-fire. Critics of Mr. Orban say that he is manipulating the issue to paper over substantive differences on matters like migration and cooperation within the European Union, and that the pope\u2019s visit had given him a gift to be used in domestic politics.",
      "Across Budapest over the weekend,",
      "Mr. Orban\u2019s supporters expressed their delight with the visit. On Saturday, Andrea Kocsy, 49, a beautician, walked a leafy street lined with Hungarians drinking wine and coffee and said she thought the pope had signaled that he supported Mr. Orban by coming to Hungary twice in less than two years. It showed, she said, that \u201che has a good relationship with Orban, that he likes how he works.\u201d",
      "She said that on the issue of migrants, \u201cOrban is right.\u201d",
      "She said it was unfair of Europe to single out Mr. Orban because \u201cMeloni is the same,\u201d referring to Giorgia Meloni, Italy\u2019s prime minister, as well as other leaders of Western European nations who have cracked down on migrants in recent years. \u201cI think they are realizing that Orban was right all along,\u201d Ms. Kocsy said.",
      "Throughout his trip, Francis brushed up against the issues of migration and the war in Ukraine in his closest visit yet to the front line. In a possible sign of his efforts to reposition himself as a facilitator of peace, he prayed for protection and peace for the \u201cbeleaguered Ukrainian people and the Russian people.\u201d",
      "\u201cBe open and inclusive,\u201d the pope implored the faithful at the end of Mass on Sunday. \u201cIn this way, help Hungary to grow in fraternity, which is the path of peace.\u201d"

They are reversing, they say, the deep inequality fed by Brazil\u2019s historically uneven distribution of land.",
      "While leftists embrace the cause \u2014 the movement\u2019s red hats depicting a couple holding a machete aloft have become commonplace at hipster bars \u2014 many Brazilians view it as communist and criminal. That has created a dilemma for the new leftist president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a longtime movement supporter who is now trying to build bridges in Congress and the powerful agriculture industry.",
      "Across Latin America, other movements inspired by the tenets of Marxism \u2014 workers rising up in a class struggle against capitalism \u2014 have sought to tackle systemic inequities, but none have ever approached the size, ambition or sophistication of Brazil\u2019s landless movement.",
      "Group organizers and outside researchers estimate that 460,000 families now live in encampments and settlements started by the movement, suggesting an informal membership approaching nearly two million people, or almost 1 percent of Brazil\u2019s population. It is, by some measures, Latin America\u2019s largest social movement.",
      "Under Brazil\u2019s former right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, the movement lost steam. Occupations largely stopped during the pandemic and then returned slowly in the face of opposition from Mr. Bolsonaro and farmers who became more heavily armed under his more permissive gun policies.",
      "But now, emboldened by the election of Mr. Lula, a longtime political ally, the movement\u2019s followers are ratcheting up their land seizures.",
      "\u201cWe elected Lula, but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Pedro St\u00e9dile, a movement co-founder, said in a message broadcast to members on Easter Sunday, announcing a \u201cRed April\u201d push to invade new land.",
      "There have been 33 occupations in less than four months of Mr. Lula\u2019s presidency, including eight in one weekend this month. Under Mr. Bolsonaro, there were about 15 occupations a year, according to government statistics. (About two decades ago, when land was even less equally distributed, there were hundreds of invasions a year.)",
      "Mr. Lula has said little about the new invasions, though two of his cabinet ministers have criticized them.",
      "The new occupations have given rise to a countermovement: \u201cInvasion Zero.\u201d Thousands of farmers who say they do not trust the government to protect their land are organizing to confront squatters and remove them, though so far, there has been little violence.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to go into battle, but no one wants to lose their property either,\u201d said Everaldo Santos, 72, a cattle rancher who leads a local farmers\u2019 union and owns a 1,000-acre ranch near the Itabela encampment. \u201cYou bought it, paid for it, have the documents, pay the taxes. So you don\u2019t let people invade and leave it at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou defend what\u2019s yours.\u201d",
      "Despite the landless movement\u2019s aggressive tactics, the Brazilian courts and government have recognized thousands of settlements as legal under laws that say farmland must be productive.",
      "The proliferation of legal settlements has turned the movement into a major food producer, selling hundreds of thousands of tons of milk, beans, coffee and other commodities each year, much of it organic after the movement pushed members to ditch pesticides and fertilizers years ago. The movement is now Latin America\u2019s largest supplier of organic rice, according to a large rice producers\u2019 union.",
      "Still, opinion surveys have shown that many Brazilians oppose the movement\u2019s land occupations. Some of the movement\u2019s more militant members have invaded active farms run by large agribusinesses, destroyed crops and even briefly occupied the family farm of a former Brazilian president.",
      "On the ground, the conflict pits hundreds of thousands of impoverished farm laborers and a network of leftist activists against wealthy families, large corporations and many small family farms.",
      "Conservative lawmakers accused Mr. St\u00e9dile, the movement co-organizer, of inciting crimes with his call for new occupations, and have opened a congressional investigation.",
      "The day after Mr. St\u00e9dile called for invasions, he joined Mr. Lula on a state visit to China. (The government brought representatives of several large food producers.)",
      "Mr. Lula has long had close ties to the movement. Brazil\u2019s first working-class president, he supported it in his first administration two decades ago. Later, while he was imprisoned on corruption charges that were later thrown out, movement activists camped outside the jailhouse for his entire 580-day incarceration.",
      "The inequity over land ownership in Brazil is rooted in colonial-era land-distribution policies that consolidated land in the hands of powerful white men.",
      "The government has sought to tilt the balance by essentially confiscating arable, unused land and giving it to people who need it. The landless movement has sought to force such reallocations by occupying unproductive land.",
      "Bernardo Man\u00e7ano Fernandes, a S\u00e3o Paulo State University professor who has studied the movement for decades, said the government has legalized about 60 percent of the movement\u2019s occupations, a rate he attributed to organizers\u2019 success at identifying unused land.",
      "But critics say the government is encouraging invasions by rewarding squatters with land, instead of forcing them to get in line, like others who must go through bureaucratic channels to apply for property. Movement leaders say they seize land because the government does not act unless pressured.",
      "That is what the people camped in Itabela are hoping for.",
      "The encampment\u2019s residents had varied paths but all shared the same goal: their own slice of land. A homeless man arrived with his belongings in a wheelbarrow. A middle-aged couple abandoned a shack on the farm where they worked, for a chance at their own. And newlyweds making minimum wage decided to squat because they thought they would never be able to afford to buy land.",
      "\u201cThe city is not good for us,\u201d said Marcl\u00e9sio Teles, 35, a coffee picker standing outside the shack he built for his family of five, his disabled daughter in a wheelchair beside him. \u201cA place like this is a place of peace.\u201d",
      "That peace nearly ended a few weeks ago.",
      "The siblings who inherited the land from their father in 2020 successfully petitioned a local judge to order the encampment dismantled. They argued that the land was productive and therefore should not be turned over to the occupiers. Movement activists admitted there were still some cattle on the land, which they were trying to keep away from their new crops.",
      "The police went to evict the settlers, joined by dozens of angry farmers, and were met by about 60 encampment residents, some carrying farm tools.",
      "Instead of a fight, however, the residents resisted by singing landless movement hymns, Ms. Manthay said. The police, worried about a clash, paused the eviction.",
      "The movement\u2019s lawyers have since appealed and asked for a permanent settlement on more than 2,000 acres the siblings own. A state agency has said the government should analyze the movement\u2019s claims. The case is still pending.",
      "\u201cIf they remove us, we\u2019ll occupy again,\u201d Mr. Teles said. \u201cThe struggle is constant.\u201d",
      "About 90 minutes down the road, there is a window into what the future could be: a 5,000-acre settlement that was ruled legal in 2016 after six years of occupation. The 227 families there each have 20 to 25 acres, spread across rolling hills of farmland and grazing cattle. They share tractors and plows, but otherwise farm their own parcel. Together they produce roughly two tons of food a month.",
      "Daniel Alves, 54, used to work in someone else\u2019s fields before he began squatting on this land in 2010. Now he grows 27 different crops on 20 acres, showing off bananas, peppercorns, bright pink dragon fruit and the Amazonian fruit cupua\u00e7u \u2014 all organic. He sells the produce at local fairs.",
      "He said he remained poor \u2014 his shack was lined with tarps \u2014 but was happy.",
      "\u201cThis movement takes people out of misery,\u201d he said.",
      "His granddaughter, Esterfany Alves, 11, followed him around the farm, petting their donkey and picking ripe fruit. She attends a public school on the settlement partly run by the movement, one of roughly 2,000 movement schools across Brazil.",
      "The schools make protests part of the curriculum and teach students about farming, land rights and inequality.",
      "In other words, Esterfany said, the school had taught her \u201cabout the struggle.\u201d",

      "The kings and queens of London\u2019s lesser-known royal family gathered outside a church in Covent Garden on a recent Sunday afternoon dressed in their sparkly finery.",
      "But their jewels of choice were not diamonds or rubies. They were\u00a0buttons made of mother-of-pearl that covered their jet-black suits and hats in intricate patterns, sewn by hand into elaborate designs that glitter in the sunlight.",
      "These are the Pearly Kings and Queens of London \u2014 keepers of a tradition that began in the Victorian era, was passed down through generations of families and became a symbol of the city\u2019s working-class, Cockney culture. They see themselves as custodians of a waning way of life, which they carry on by singing Cockney songs, sharing Cockney stories and, crucially, collecting money for good causes.",
      "Modern pearlies, grouped by geographic area of London, have organized themselves into a few charitable groups and, like the better-known royal family, have at times feuded. But the pearlies argue over which group ",
      ".",
      "Once a month, some pearlies\u00a0rattle blue plastic buckets to collect charity donations at Covent Garden, a former market turned tourist draw, in London\u2019s West End.",
      "\u201cMost Londoners know about the Pearly Kings and Queens,\u201d said John Walters, 75, who holds the title of Pearly King of Finsbury, an area of north London. \u201cI had an elderly lady come up here and she grabbed hold of me and she started crying and said, \u2018I\u2019m so pleased to see you\u2019re still around.\u2019 She said, \u2018You are London.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tourists, though, are often pleasantly\u00a0surprised\u00a0to encounter them.",
      "On a bright March morning, Mr. Walters and Clive Bennett, 68, the Pearly King of Woolwich, in the city\u2019s southeast, were approached by a group of young women \u2014 one wearing a \u201cbride to be\u201d sash \u2014 who asked for a photograph. The men, in Cockney accents, instantly broke into a rendition of \u201cGet Me to the Church on Time\u201d from \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d as the women erupted in laughter and threw a few pounds into their buckets. The men tipped their flat caps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real honor to be able to do something like this actually, and it\u2019s fun,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cYou meet all sorts of people.\u201d",
      "He was invited to take part in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics and took part in events on the sidelines of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s jubilee and funeral.",
      "The over-the-top outfits that the pearlies are known for \u2014 with the back of their clothing bearing their august titles in bold lettering \u2014 are as peculiar as they are eye-catching, with feathers, shine and patterns assaulting the eyes. The idea for the finery grew from the tradition in\u00a0Cockney culture of\u00a0thumbing noses at London society\u2019s disdainful view of the lower classes.",
      "For Mr. Bennett, and many others, being a pearly is a family affair. His wife, Kim, 66, is a Pearly Queen and his daughter and grandchildren take part in fund-raising\u00a0events, as well, under the title of Pearly Princesses and Princes.",
      "Like most royal families, pearlies typically inherit their titles or marry into the tradition. But others, like the Bennetts, have been invited in because of their commitment to community work and charity.",
      "\u201cToday, there is a need for us now more than ever, \u201d Ms. Bennett said, as she pointed to the\u00a0inflationary pressures on many local\u00a0communities.",
      "Henry Croft \u2014 an orphan and a London street sweeper \u2014 is considered the first Pearly King. In the late 1870s, he\u00a0became known for covering his clothing with mother-of-pearl buttons to draw attention as he collected money for hospitals and orphanages.",
      "Mr. Croft was said to have taken his fashion inspiration from costermongers, who were roving traders selling fruit, vegetables, fish and produce on the streets of east London, a working-class area that developed its own distinct accent and vocabulary riddled with rhyming slang, known as Cockney.",
      "The costermongers sewed buttons onto their clothes to distinguish themselves and to mimic the rich, ",
      ". These coster communities would elect a leader in their local area to keep the peace and collect money to support fellow traders down on their luck.",
      "\u201cIf someone\u2019s fruit went off, or the donkey was ill, or something like that,\u201d said Mr. Bennett, describing how the costermongers would have a singalong and pass around a bucket for donations. \u201cI think that\u2019s where Henry Croft got his whole ethos from.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Croft took his pearly suits and generosity to a new level, putting on his dazzling button suit as he gathered money for the poor and the sick.",
      "Others soon joined him. At the time of Mr. Croft\u2019s funeral in 1930, dozens of pearlies from across London joined the cortege to honor him, ",
      ".",
      "While London lore holds that to be a true Cockney, a person must be born within earshot of Bow Bells, which ring from ",
      " in east London, pearly titles are now held by people from communities across all of London\u2019s boroughs.",
      "While some pearly traditions have shifted, the rules on the buttons themselves have stayed consistent: They must be true mother-of-pearl, not imitation. Generally, they are passed down through families.",
      "\u201cA lot of the buttons are over 100 years old on there,\u201d said David Hemsley, 60, describing the jacket he inherited from his father.",
      "In Covent Garden, after a few hours of cheekily delivering rhyming Cockney slang to curious crowds and singing old tunes with gusto while collecting donations, the pearlies make their way into the nearby St. Paul\u2019s Church to hold their monthly meeting.",
      "\u201cCome on then, let\u2019s go!\u201d\u00a0Doreen Golding, 83, the Pearly Queen of Bow Bells and the Old Kent Road, shouted to the group as she led the way to the church vestry.",
      "As the chairwoman of London\u2019s Pearly Kings and Queens Society, Ms. Golding was honored by the late queen for her charity efforts. She said the pearlies would continue to wear their buttons and keep up their charitable giving for as long as there was a need.",
      "\u201cI get upset when someone says, \u2018Oh, are you still around? We didn\u2019t think there was any more of you left,\u2019\u201d Ms. Golding said with a laugh. \u201cAnd I think, \u2018Now hang on, open your bloody eyes and look, we are here!\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cLove for the royal family has sort of declined,\u201d said Jason Abdalla, 24, an information technology worker outside a pub last Friday in the exclusive Mayfair neighborhood of London. \u201cIt feels like appreciating the monarchy is an older, more mature thing.

      "Whereas the queen\u2019s coronation symbolized a new start for the country and the royal family, Mr. Owens said, Charles\u2019s coronation comes after a period of family feuds that has left the House of Windsor divided and diminished.",

Therefore, the monarchy is bound to attract more skepticism.\u201d",
      "Buckingham Palace is sensitive to the changing attitudes. It has cut back the procession route between the palace and Westminster Abbey from that taken by Elizabeth in 1953. That has the benefit of sparing central London from gridlock while also ensuring that the crowds lining the streets do not look sparse.",
      "The ceremony itself has also been modified to account for a more diverse ecumenical country. Though many of its rituals still date back more than 1,000 years, the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, who will preside over the service, has added several innovations to make it more inclusive.",

The archbishop will invite millions of people from across the nation and Commonwealth to pay homage to the king, a rite that was reserved for the hereditary aristocracy at Elizabeth\u2019s coronation. And before he leaves Westminster Abbey, Charles will pause for a greeting from a group of non-Christian religious leaders.",

      "An officer in Russia\u2019s Federal Guard Service, which is responsible for protecting President Vladimir V. Putin, decided last fall to avoid fighting in Ukraine by sneaking across the southern border into Kazakhstan.",
      "The officer, Maj. Mikhail Zhilin, disguised himself as a mushroom picker, wearing camouflage and carrying a couple of small bottles of cognac\u00a0so that he could douse himself and then act drunk and disoriented if he encountered the Russian border patrol.",
      "In the dark, the lean, fit major navigated across the forested frontier without incident, but he was arrested on the other side.",
      "\u201cFreedom is not given to people that easily,\u201d he told his wife, Ekaterina Zhilina, months later, after Kazakhstan rejected his bid for political asylum and handed him back to Russia to face trial for desertion.",
      "\u201cHe had these romantic notions when he first began his military-academic studies,\u201d Ms.\u00a0Zhilina\u00a0said in a recent interview, describing perceptions drawn from Russian literature about the honor and pride inherent in defending your homeland. \u201cBut everything soured when the war started.\u201d",
      "Major Zhilin is among the hundreds of Russian men who faced criminal charges for becoming ",
      " since Moscow\u2019s ",
      "\u00a0last year. Some ",
      ", while those already serving desert or ",
      " to redeploy on the bloody, chaotic battlefields of Ukraine. ",
      " Last year 1,121 people were convicted of evading mandatory military conscription, according to statistics from Russia\u2019s Supreme Court, compared with an average of around 600 in other recent years. Before the war, a vast majority were fined, not imprisoned. Russia recently ",
      " making it much harder to avoid a draft summons.",
      "In addition, criminal cases have been initiated against more than 1,000 soldiers, mostly for abandoning their units, according to ",
      " by Mediazona, an independent Russian news outlet. Anticipating the problem in\u00a0September, when several hundred thousand civilians ",
      ", Russia toughened the penalties for being AWOL.",
      "The maximum sentence was doubled to 10 years\u00a0for what is euphemistically called \u201cLeaving for Sochi.\u201d (SOCH is the Russian acronym for AWOL, but the expression is a play on the name of Sochi, a Black Sea getaway for the country\u2019s elite and site of the ",
      ".) Refusing an order to participate in combat carries a sentence of three to 10 years.",
      "That has\u00a0not stopped Russian men from going to unusual lengths to avoid fighting. One officer said he took a bullet in the leg as part of a pact among several soldiers to shoot one another and then claim that they were wounded in a firefight. Hailed as a hero for various battlefield events, he needed six months to recover, at which point he decided to flee.",
      " The Kremlin has shrouded in secrecy an increasing amount of information about the military, including new statistics about crimes involving military service, so the numbers are undoubtedly higher than what is available. But the number of AWOL cases accelerated after the general mobilization, according to Mediazona. Many criminal cases involve soldiers who refused\u00a0orders\u00a0to enter battle, leading to confrontations with their commanders, according to several lawyers who defend soldiers.",
      "One lawyer, Dmitri Kovalenko, was\u00a0retained by the families of more than 10 soldiers who said they were thrown into pits, called \u201czindans,\u201d near the front line after refusing to fight. \u201cPeople realize that they are not ready \u2014 that their commanders are not ready, that they have to go in blind, not knowing where or why,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0said.",
      "Intimidation is the first response of commanders, he said, so treatment can be harsh. Two soldiers whom he defended were locked into a container last summer without food or water, he said. At one point, about 300 conscripts who refused to fight last year were held in a basement in eastern Ukraine, where they were threatened, called \u201cpigs,\u201d not fed and not allowed to go to the toilet or to bathe, ",
      ", an independent news outlet, and other Russian news\u00a0media\u00a0organizations, quoting relatives. The Wagner mercenary group has threatened to execute its refuseniks, and there have been scattered reports of them being shot.",
      "In theory, Russian law allows for conscientious objectors\u2019 performing alternative service, but it is rarely granted. Sometimes those charged with refusing to fight are given suspended sentences, which means they can be redeployed.",
      "The officer who was shot in the leg by his colleague had pursued a military career since he was\u00a09 and\u00a0a cadet, he said, but he wanted it to be over the minute he was ordered into Ukraine. He ended up staying\u00a0about three months, appalled by the very idea of the war as well as\u00a0by ",
      ".",
      "Soldiers were not provided basic items like underwear, he said, and few knew how to navigate\u00a0and got themselves killed.",
      "\u201cThere are no saints on either side,\u201d said the officer, who spoke on\u00a0the condition that he not be named, nor his location published, out of concern that Russia might seek his extradition. \u201cThe locals were actively partisan. I shot back. I didn\u2019t want to die.\u201d",
      "After he recovered, and the military ordered him back to Ukraine, he decided to run. ",
      "\u201cI\u2019m ready to die for Russia, but I don\u2019t want to fight, to risk my life for the criminals who sit in the government,\u201d said the officer, who is\u00a0now on a wanted list in Russia.",
      "Another Russian, a member of the Sakha ethnic group concentrated in the Siberian region of Yakutia, also deserted. Five days among the drunken, newly mobilized soldiers at an army camp convinced him to leave.",
      "The man, who\u00a0also insisted on anonymity, was fired from his construction job\u00a0so that he could\u00a0go fight. Packed onto an airplane, the draftees discovered their destination for training by looking at their phones when they landed. Most soldiers drank constantly, he said\u00a0in an interview. One night in another barracks, he said, a\u00a0soldier stabbed another to death.",
      "The conscript said that the racist attitude of his Russian officers when he did his military service a decade earlier had soured him on the military \u2014 they called him \u201creindeer herder\u201d because of his ethnic Siberian background. He said he was subjected to similar comments as soon as he mobilized. Things deteriorated further after he tried to bribe his lieutenant to leave. The officer mocked him openly as a coward.",
      "His mother flew in to extract him, directing a taxi to a hole in the base\u2019s fence. After he fled the country and was charged with desertion, he faced fierce criticism from home, he said, with the\u00a0authorities saying that he had disgraced the Sakha people. Even a close friend threatened to beat him up.",
      "Some Russian courts still publicize military cases to create a chilling deterrent to potential deserters. In the spring, for example, a court ",
      " that a sailor who had gone AWOL twice had been sentenced to nine years in a prison colony.",
      "The Krasnoyarsk Garrison Military Court released a photograph\u00a0and a statement in December showing dozens of soldiers crowding a courtroom to watch an AWOL case. The sentence was pronounced before that audience \u201cfor preventive purposes,\u201d ",
      ".",
      "In the Belgorod region near the Ukrainian border, two soldiers were detained on a parade ground in November and charged with refusing to obey a deployment order. They were called out of the ranks, handcuffed and thrown into a paddy wagon in front of their unit, all shown ",
      " posted on the Telegram messaging app. Earlier this month, both were sentenced to three years in prison, according to Russian news\u00a0media reports.",
      "Well before the war, Major Zhilin, 36, the soldier who left for Kazakhstan, had become disenchanted with the very administration\u00a0he was assigned to protect. An engineer, he worked in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk for the presidential security service, supervising the Kremlin\u2019s communications lines with the eastern parts of Russia.",
      "The assassination of the Russian\u00a0opposition leader ",
      " in 2015 and the poisoning of ",
      " in 2020 had drawn his attention, his wife said. He started following political news more closely.",
      "He weighed quitting but decided he could endure the two years until he received a pension. Then came the war. \u201c\u2018It is one thing to suppress human rights,\u2019\u201d his wife quoted him as saying, \u201c\u2018it is quite another to kill people.\u2019\u201d",
      "In the fall, before the mobilization, he had visited the cemetery where his mother is buried. He found 30 new graves of riot police\u00a0officers who had fought in the war. The ribbon on one small wreath said just \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "Two colleagues had already died in Ukraine, and he wondered if his son, 11, and daughter, 8, might one day make a similar wreath. When the\u00a0mobilization was announced, he quickly\u00a0decided\u00a0to leave the country.",
      "Since his security clearance gave him access to state secrets, leaving was prohibited. He decided to cross on foot while his family drove into Kazakhstan legally.",
      "But the plan went awry. Lacking a cell signal, he could not find their car. He was arrested after stumbling upon a Kazakh\u00a0border\u00a0officer. He requested political asylum, but in December, he was deported.",
      "In March, he was sentenced to six and a half years in a penal colony and stripped of his rank.",
      "Right after he was deported, his wife, fearing that she and the children would also be sent back, sought and received political asylum in France.",
      "So far, her husband has not been mistreated, she said. The couple, although bitter toward the Kazakh authorities, consider the sentence a far better alternative than dying in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cMikhail wrote me that he feels morally freer than he was,\u201d she said, adding that he told her, \u201c\u2018I guess you have to pay a certain price for the freedom to think and to say what you want.\u2019\u201d",

      "Whatever news gods decided that the cable television stars Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon should be fired the same week that President Biden was scheduled to give a funny speech ribbing the news media certainly were generous in providing fresh material. And Mr. Biden took advantage on Saturday night as he gleefully mocked some of his favorite foils.",
      "In his annual appearance at the black-tie White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, the one night a year that a president is expected to play a stand-up comic, Mr. Biden made the most of the opportunity with some timely skewering of those who usually skewer him \u2014 most notably Fox News, which ",

      ".",
      "\u201cLast year, your favorite Fox News reporters were able to attend\u201d the dinner \u201cbecause they were fully vaccinated and boosted,\u201d Mr. Biden said, in a nod to his ",
      " strategy. \u201cThis year, with that $787 million settlement, they\u2019re here because they couldn\u2019t say no to a free meal.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd hell, I\u2019d call Fox honest, fair and truthful,\u201d he told the crowd gathered in a cavernous ballroom in Washington as well as a national television audience watching at home. \u201cBut then I could be sued for defamation.\u201d When some groaned, he quipped, \u201cIt ain\u2019t nothing compared to what they do to me.\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden also went after CNN. Just five days after the financially struggling network ",
      " following comments that a woman in her fifties is past her prime, the president ribbed, \u201cCNN was like, \u2018Wow! They actually have $787 million? Whoa!\u2019\u201d",
      "At another point, Mr. Biden managed to jab both Fox and CNN while deflecting questions about his age as he seeks re-election. \u201cYou might think I don\u2019t like Rupert Murdoch,\u201d the 80-year-old president said of the 92-year-old Fox impresario. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true. How can I dislike a guy who makes me look like Harry Styles?",
      "\u201cYou call me old?\u201d Mr. Biden went on. \u201cI call it being seasoned. You say I\u2019m ancient? I say I\u2019m wise. You say I\u2019m over the hill? Don Lemon would say that\u2019s a man in his prime.\u201d",

The industry is reeling from a steady drumbeat of layoffs and closures, but it was the firings of the two high-profile, millionaire cable personalities that had everybody talking.",
      "In its second year since the pandemic, the dinner has mushroomed into an even more splashy spectacle. Like the wedding of a wealthy family, it has now replicated into multiple events spread over five days, with the first pre-dinner parties and receptions starting Wednesday night and the last post-dinner brunches scheduled for Sunday.",

Some of the buzziest parties were hosted by news start-ups intent on establishing themselves, including Crooked Media, Axios and Semafor.",
      "The late-night party hosted by United Talent Agency, which represents many television news anchors and correspondents, drew the most interest. Mr. Lemon, a client, showed up ready to mingle with a crowd that included the actress Cobie Smulders, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary-turned-MSNBC host. At one point, the man responsible for Mr. Lemon\u2019s ouster, the chief executive of CNN, Chris Licht, was at the party too, although it was unclear if the two spotted each other.",
      "The hottest ticket on Saturday night was the after-party hosted by the media mogul Byron Allen and the news website The Grio at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. The event was honoring Gayle King of CBS News and Diana Ross was scheduled to perform. On Sunday, brunches hosted by CNN and Politico marked the end of the festivities.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u2019s new editor in chief, Emma Tucker, mingled at a pre-dinner reception on Saturday hosted by the paper\u2019s publisher, Almar Latour. Attendees wore #freeEvan stickers, referring to Evan Gershkovich, its reporter ",
      ", which The Journal and the U.S. government have denied.",
      "Mr. Biden opened his act with comments about Mr. Gershkovich and other Americans held overseas. \u201cEveryone in this hall stands with you,\u201d the president said, addressing Mr. Gershkovich\u2019s family, who was in attendance. \u201cWe\u2019re working every day to secure his release, looking at opportunities and tools to bring him home. We keep the faith.\u201d",
      "He also mentioned Austin Tice, a journalist ",
      ", and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine ",
      " on what the United States says are fabricated charges of espionage. Mr. Biden pointed in the audience to Brittney Griner, the W.N.B.A. star ",
      " after being detained for nearly 10 months in Russia. \u201cBoy, I can hardly wait to see you back on the court, kid,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Biden\u2019s supportive comments about a free press contrasted sharply with those by President Donald J. Trump, who constantly called reporters \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and their reports \u201cfake news.\u201d But Mr. Biden gingerly acknowledged his own reluctance to engage with the reporters who cover him other than in passing. He has given ",
      " and fewer interviews than any modern president. Alluding to this, Mr. Biden said his dinner speech would be like his press interactions: \u201cI\u2019ll talk for 10 minutes, take no questions and cheerfully walk away.\u201d",
      "He made a few passes at Mr. Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, his would-be Republican challengers. Mr. Biden joked that he had created 12 million jobs \u201cand that\u2019s just the lawyers\u201d defending Mr. Trump. As for Mr. DeSantis, the president said, \u201cAfter his re-election as governor, he was asked if he had a mandate. He said, \u2018Hell no, I\u2019m straight.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mr. Biden went after congressional Republicans as well. Telling dinner attendees to be safe, he said, \u201cIf you find yourself disoriented or confused, it\u2019s either you\u2019re drunk or Marjorie Taylor Greene.\u201d Noting that his approval rating stands at 42 percent, he said, \u201cKevin McCarthy called me and asked me, \u2018Joe what the hell\u2019s your secret?\u2019\u201d",
      "The featured comedian of the evening, Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent on the Comedy Channel\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d poked gentle fun at Mr. Biden. As he followed the president to the podium, Mr. Wood held up papers and told Mr. Biden, who faces a special counsel investigation into the mishandling of secret papers, \u201cI think you left some of your classified documents up here.\u201d",
      "Mr. Wood noted that protesters in France rioted over ",
      " and contrasted that with Mr. Biden. \u201cWe have an 80-year-old man begging us for four more years of work,\u201d he said. Noting the president\u2019s \u201clet me finish the job\u201d mantra, Mr. Wood added, \u201cThat\u2019s not a campaign slogan. That\u2019s a plea.\u201d",

      " a feature film about the case, at the White House, finished with a plea to fight for democracy.",
      "\u201cWe know in our bones and you know it too our democracy remains at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also made it clear, as I\u2019ve seen throughout my life, it is within our power, each and every one of us, to preserve our democracy. We can, we must, we will.\u201d"

She ran with the backing of the party\u2019s top brass, including Representative James E. Clyburn, and will be the first Black woman to lead the state party.",

      ". Her biggest competitor, Brandon Upson, the state Black caucus chair, painted her as an establishment candidate whose connections to the old guard would stymie the party\u2019s progress in an all-important election year.",
      "Democrats who supported Mr. Upson were seeking to overhaul a state party they felt had long been dominated by Mr. Clyburn \u2014 who helped President Biden win the state primary in 2020 \u2014 ahead of South Carolina\u2019s debut as the party\u2019s first presidential primary state in 2024 and in the wake of a down cycle in the 2022 midterm elections.",
      "Still, it was Ms. Spain\u2019s connections, paired with her campaign strategy \u2014 characterized by social media blasts and regular visits to county party meetings and cattle calls \u2014 that ultimately delivered her the victory. She won with the support of nearly 700 of the party\u2019s roughly 1,000 state delegates in a standing vote. Before delegates for Mr. Upson could stand up to vote for him, he conceded to Ms. Spain in a short speech calling for party unity.",
      "As the next chair, Ms. Spain will be responsible for preparing the state party for its moment in prime time: voting first in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary election. She will also have to rebuild a party in turmoil. Democrats lost several safe State House and Senate seats and had low voter turnout during the 2022 midterms, a year that was otherwise considered positive for the party nationally. Ms. Spain\u2019s leadership will offer Palmetto State Democrats a chance to make up those losses and get ready for the national stage.",

      "But there is evidence of a drop-off in Black voter engagement during the 2022 midterm election, although the results were broadly seen as heartening for Mr. Biden and his party, despite Republicans winning the House.",
      "The share of Black voters in the electorate dropped by 1 percent nationally from 2018 to 2022, the biggest drop of any racial group measured, while the share of white, college-educated voters increased, according to data from HIT Strategies, a Democratic polling firm.",

      "California state regulators approved on Friday a ban on the sale of new big rigs and buses that run on diesel by 2036, going beyond the federal government in issuing requirements to reduce emissions and setting the stage for other states to follow suit.",
      "The rule is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious moves by California and the federal government to curb planet-warming pollution from vehicles, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gases.",
      "The California Air Resources Board approved the regulation, which by 2045 would fully eliminate the sale of new trucks that emit carbon dioxide across the state. The rule builds in intermediate goals in the coming years for government organizations and private companies to decrease their use of diesel trucks.",
      "The ban, if approved by the federal government, would create the most stringent practices related to truck emissions in the country, keeping California at the forefront of states in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Some large companies have already begun to use heavy-duty vehicles that emit little to no carbon dioxide, but the plan would require a complete transition in new truck purchases by 2036.",
      "\u201cThis rule provides manufacturers, truck owners and fueling providers the assurance that there will be a market and the demand for zero-emissions vehicles, while providing a flexible path to making the transition toward clean air,\u201d Liane Randolph, chair of the board, said in a statement.",
      "But the American Trucking Associations, a trade organization for the trucking industry, criticized the ban, saying that it has worked to significantly reduce emissions but needs more flexibility. Chris Spear, the president and chief executive of the group, said California was setting \u201cunrealistic targets and unachievable timelines\u201d that will increase costs.",
      "The state hopes the ban will save money related to health costs caused by pollution, including asthma attacks and respiratory illness.",
      "When California, the nation\u2019s largest car and truck market, sets new rules on tailpipe pollution, it has an impact across the rest of the country \u2014 and the world. The state has for decades been at the vanguard of the nation\u2019s clean air regulations. California is unique among the states in that the 1970 Clean Air Act allows it to set tighter air pollution rules than those used by the federal government \u2014 and historically, when it does so, the federal government often follows. While the ban on diesel truck sales would be the only one of its kind in the world, many other states and, eventually, the federal government could enact similar policies, which could in turn influence global policies, since trucks are manufactured and driven around the world.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last year, with pandemic lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Whole Foods Market made a bet on a gritty San Francisco neighborhood. The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.",
      "But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of\u00a0568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.",
      "\u201cMale w/machete is back,\u201d the report on one 911 call states. \u201cAnother security guard was just assaulted,\u201d another says. A man with a four-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.",
      "In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.",
      "When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city\u2019s most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.",
      "The closure also seemed to be the latest indicator of San Francisco\u2019s faltering economic prospects, providing more grist for an ongoing debate over ",
      " after tying its fate to the tech industry. The Whole Foods was supposed to cater to tech workers and other professionals, part of a long-term redevelopment plan downtown. But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city's center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.",
      "In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco\u2019s continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco\u2019s downtown remains at roughly a third of prepandemic levels \u2014 lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to ",
      " that used cellphone data as a measure.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a very slow recovery,\u201d Effi Shoua said this month from behind his desk at the downtown fine art gallery he owns in Union Square. The area is a prime spot for tourists, who have been steadily returning to the city, a bright spot and a contrast to the 26 percent vacancy rate of downtown offices.",
      "Many merchants are worried about a domino effect of commercial failures if office workers are permanently absent for about half of the week, while people using drugs, going through mental crises or living on the street\u00a0remain more visible than ever.",
      "The impact on the city\u2019s budget is significant, too: Office-based industries account for nearly three quarters of the city\u2019s gross domestic product. After years of surpluses, the government now forecasts a $780 million deficit in the upcoming two fiscal years \u2014 roughly a 6 percent cut in its general fund, according to the mayor\u2019s office.",
      "City officials say they are searching for ways to diversify the economy and to reduce homelessness and drug dealing. They realize that some of the largest local employers, Big Tech companies, will not be towing San Francisco from its economic shoals. Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.",
      "San Francisco leaders point out that the city has rebounded again and again, including after the near-collapse of the tech industry in 2000 and the national recession about eight years later.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been counted out before, and there have been others who have tried to imply because things aren\u2019t happening as fast or the way that they think it should happen, that it\u2019s over,\u201d London Breed, the city\u2019s mayor, said in an interview.",
      "In the famously liberal city, where Republicans make up just 7 percent of the electorate, moderate Democrats like Mayor Breed are calling for aggressive steps to address public safety concerns while progressive voices decry law-and-order strategies as kneejerk responses that trample on the vulnerable.",
      "City leaders face some limitations. A federal judge in April determined that San Francisco ",
      " from public spaces because it has not done enough to provide shelter. Mayor Breed is backing bills in the State Legislature that would make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment. The mayor has also proposed addressing homelessness by building more: slashing the permitting process for construction with the goal of building 83,000 additional homes and apartments \u2014 a 20 percent increase from the city\u2019s current total housing stock \u2014 in eight years.",
      "Even though the downtown is plastered with \u201cfor lease\u201d signs, the city\u2019s ",
      " is under 3 percent and the mayor and other officials say the engineering talent pool remains the city\u2019s top asset. And there is much more to San Francisco than its downtown. It has always been a constellation\u00a0of very different neighborhoods, some of which have very few of the social ills that afflict the area near the closed Whole Foods.",
      "Officials add that\u00a0the downtown may ultimately emerge more resilient if it attracts industries like life sciences and bio-tech whose employees still need work space. There is growth in the tech industry, too: The development of artificial intelligence, which promises to transform the way that people live and work, is ",

      "Garry Tan, the president of Y Combinator, a prominent venture-capital company, says he sees signs of renewal in San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s the gold rush over and over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Tan is part of a generation of tech workers who are more assertive in their demands on city officials, unafraid to take sides in the city\u2019s internecine politics and funding organizations that press for more emphasis on public safety.",
      "\u201cNow the narrative out there for some of the founders in our community is, I\u2019m not sure if I feel safe here. I\u2019m not sure if I want to stay here. The quality of life issues are the question. Can I raise a family here?\u201d",

      " of murder, and\u00a0San Francisco\u2019s\u00a0murder rate is quite low compared with other major cities. Overall, police statistics show fewer property and violent crimes in 2022 than in 2018, before\u00a0the pandemic began.",
      "Still, Bill Scott, the city\u2019s police chief, says many residents complain that they feel less safe, and the open-air drug use, much of it tied to fentanyl, is a major contributor.",
      "Matt Dorsey, a member of the board of supervisors who lives steps away from the shuttered Whole Foods, said recent elections had signaled a shift in voter priorities. He pointed to last year\u2019s recall of the city\u2019s progressive district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was replaced by a prosecutor who vowed to be tougher on crime.",
      "\u201cSan Francisco is in the midst of a voter revolt on public safety,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. In ",
      " in September, nearly two-thirds of respondents said life in the city was worse off than when they moved here.",
      "The new district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, has begun prosecuting more drug crimes than Mr. Boudin, but the city experienced a 40 percent jump in fatal overdoses in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.",
      "Citing\u00a0that statistic, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday authorized an antidrug task force in San Francisco that will include members of the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol.",
      "The mayor and the police chief have vowed to hire hundreds of additional officers, which would expand the force by more than one-fourth, a difficult proposition when law enforcement agencies nationwide are facing shortages.",
      "Not everyone is on board with that.",
      "Dean Preston, a member of the board of supervisors who was re-elected in 2020 on a Democratic Socialist platform, is against increasing police staffing and believes the idea of a shift in the electorate\u2019s view about public safety is overstated.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a massive propaganda effort to change public opinion around policing and public safety,\u201d he said.",
      "Mr. Preston uses his district as an example of how uneven the pandemic recovery has been. Some areas like Japantown and Haight Ashbury are thriving, he said. Others like the Tenderloin, which is adjacent to the shuttered Whole Foods, are beset by drug dealing and homelessness.",
      "One of the next big tests for downtown might be this summer\u2019s expected opening of an Ikea store not far from the Whole Foods site.",
      "Police described theft as rampant at Whole Foods, with thieves walking out\u00a0with armfuls of alcohol, at least at the start. After 250 shopping hand baskets were stolen, the company restocked with 50 more. Those went missing, too.",
      "During the store\u2019s 13 months in operation, at least 14 people were arrested, including on charges of grand theft and battery, according to official reports. Chief Scott said that\u00a0plainclothes officers were sent there and security improved over time, but seemingly not enough for the company.",
      "On a recent chilly night across from the shuttered store, Joseph Peterson, a former construction worker who lost both of his legs to diabetes and is homeless, rolled down the sidewalk in his wheelchair. Mr. Peterson could see the 2,000-unit Trinity apartments, the high-end complex that Whole Foods had hoped would be its customer base. Across the intersection, security guards stood sentry in front of the Orpheum Theater, where \u201cPretty Woman: The Musical\u201d was playing. A few dozen steps away, dealers peddled fentanyl and crystal meth.",
      "Mr. Peterson said he understood why Whole Foods had closed the store.",
      "\u201cPeople kept stealing from it,\u201d he said. He, too, had taken macaroni and cheese and chicken from the hot food bar a number of times, he said. But he made a distinction. Other people stole from the store because they wanted to resell what they took.",
