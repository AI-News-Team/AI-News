      "CHESTER, England \u2014 When Waheed Arian was 5, his father knelt by his side and handed him a big, colorful kite. That small moment, in Afghanistan, seared itself into the son\u2019s memory.",
      "\u201cI was a child born into war, \u201c said Dr. Arian, now 39 and a medical doctor. \u201cI had no idea what normality was like. And I only have a couple of happy memories like this from the first years of my life.\u201d",
      "Those years, in the late 1980s and 1990s, were spent in the chaos of war, with uncertainty swirling around him, first in his home city of Kabul; then in a refugee camp in Pakistan where he was displaced with his family; and then back to an Afghanistan engulfed in civil war.",
      "Decades later, driven by hopes of one day becoming a doctor, he established a new life in Britain, where he overcame post-traumatic stress disorder, learned English and studied medicine at Cambridge University, eventually becoming an emergency room doctor.",
      "\u201cI came in with no family support and hardly an education,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cBut I wanted to do something with my life and I was taking steps toward it, although it was a long shot.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, ",
      " from Kabul to Britain as an asylum seeker. His story, a personal tale of overcoming odds, illustrates how Britain\u2019s asylum system has long provided sanctuary and opportunity for countless people.",
      "But in recent years, successive Conservative governments have cracked down on the process, particularly with policies intended to deter asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel.",
      "This month, the government ",
      " crossing the Channel without hearing their asylum claims, a position that has been criticized by human rights groups. The British government says that many who arrive this way are economic migrants and that the policy will act as a deterrent. Government data, though, shows that a majority who reach shore are eventually granted asylum.",
      "Dr. Arian said his own journey showed \u201cwhat can be done when you allow people to realize their potential.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this case, you can see the future I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are so many other futures on the line.\u201d",
      "Speaking from his home in Chester in northwestern England, Dr. Arian, a father of two, recounted the arduous journey that led him out of Afghanistan.",
      "When his parents sent him to Britain in 1999, alone at 15, it was a tough decision for them, he said. But, he explained, \u201cI was at risk of being taken as a military soldier.\u201d He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a future. I wanted to become a doctor, not a killer.\u201d",
      "So his parents scraped together the money to pay a man to help him get to Britain to join a family friend.",
      "He boarded a plane from Islamabad, Pakistan, a false passport in hand, and claimed asylum when he arrived.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I landed in the U.K., I was handcuffed and I was put in a prison,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did come with that hope of safety, and the dream to become a doctor.\u201d",
      "That dream began in childhood when he was treated for tuberculosis contracted in the refugee camp in Pakistan. Despite a grim prognosis, a local doctor gave him excellent care \u2014 and a textbook and a stethoscope. He made a full recovery and he now knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, I saw so much suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on the other hand, there was this healer who could actually magically heal people.\u201d",
      "He eventually received refugee status in Britain. He worked three jobs and began studying for his college exams. He remembers other Afghan refugees telling him to become a driver or maybe a shopkeeper.",
      "Instead, he applied to Cambridge University. And against the odds, he got in, and then went on to medical school. He became a British citizen.",
      "A soft-spoken man who seems to put care and attention into every word, Dr. Arian spoke of the importance of giving back through humanitarian efforts.",
      "\u201cWe might think it\u2019s a small thing,\u201d he said, describing the many supporters who offered him a kind word, a job or other opportunities over the years. \u201cBut it\u2019s not for many refugees. Their futures rely on all these small parts, these bits of community service, that can then shape their future.\u201d",
      "In 2015, he founded, ",
      ", a nonprofit online platform\u00a0that connects British doctors with medics in Afghanistan through video links. The service was later extended to connect doctors in Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones, to professionals around the world. It ",
      "Dr. Arian is now building off that success with\u00a0",
      ", a platform meant to offer culturally sensitive mental health support, which he believes can be beneficial for refugees who have experienced trauma. It will be free for those who can\u2019t afford to pay.",
      "He hopes to roll out Arian Wellbeing in the coming months to provide aid for those newly arrived in Britain as part of a pilot with some local officials. Within five years, he hopes thousands of psychologists will offer their services on the platform, so that it can help when the next disaster, like the recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria, or the war in Ukraine, arrives.",
      "For years after reaching the safety of Britain, the ghosts of his past haunted him.",
      "\u201cI was working so hard, three jobs at first \u2014 cleaning, kitchen porter, as well as a salesman, and in the evening I was studying a bit of English as well,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cIt was at that time that my PTSD started showing.\u201d",
      "He found himself unable to relax, clenching his hands and having flashbacks. In the middle of the night, he would wake up with intense nightmares.",
      "Working with a psychologist has helped him address these problems, he said.",
      "He, his wife and their children live in a two-bedroom home with a big backyard. They have a Burmese cat and a small dog named Pushkin. The yard is scattered with children\u2019s toys, and the walls of the home are lined with family photos. Some siblings and his father are still in Afghanistan; his mother recently died there.",
      "Last month, Dr. Arian visited a local hotel where hundreds of recently arrived asylum seekers from Afghanistan were being housed after being displaced when the country was retaken by the Taliban in 2021.",
      "\u201cI see the same problems that I experienced in their eyes,\u201d he said, describing how the children\u2019s faces lit up when he spoke to them in their shared mother tongue.",
      "In this meeting, and in the others he has had with asylum seekers from across the world who arrive in Britain, he said he has seen just how detrimental the government\u2019s policies have been on their mental health.",
      "\u201cI can only imagine what at-risk refugees are going through in hotels,\u201d he said, where many are being housed as they await a decision on their future. \u201cWe have made friends with some of them, and they are being retraumatized to be going through all this.\u201d",
      "Most of all, he saw a reflection of his own story. He hopes he can be an example for those who struggle with the complexity of life in a new and unfamiliar place.",
      "\u201cWhenever I speak to these refugees, they have their individual dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I understand that.\u201d"

      "SANTA MAR\u00cdA DE JES\u00daS, Guatemala \u2014 For her big underwater scene in \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever,\u201d the Guatemalan actress Mar\u00eda Mercedes Coroy had to hold her breath as her character, Princess Fen, gives birth in a hazy ocean world to a winged serpent son.",
      "She emerges from the watery depths as a rarity even in Marvel\u2019s fantastical universe: a female Maya superhero.",
      "The day after filming her final scene in Los Angeles, Ms. Coroy, rather than hanging out in Hollywood, headed home to Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, a Kaqchikel Maya town of about 22,000 at the base of a volcano in Guatemala. By nightfall, she was curled up in bed in her family\u2019s bright pink cinder block house with vegetables growing in the backyard.",
      "\u201cI felt like my bed was hugging me,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, 28, one of nine siblings in a family of farmers and vendors.",
      "The next morning she resumed her usual life. She and her mother put on their hand-woven huipiles, or blouses, and cortes, or skirts, to catch the 5:30 bus to the small city of Escuintla to sell produce in the bustling market, a job she started after fifth grade when she had to drop out of school to help her parents.",
      "Some days she walks two hours with a mule to the family farm to cultivate cabbage and pumpkins. In her spare time, she weaves colorful huipiles with motifs of birds and flowers on a backstrap loom.",
      "\u201cPeople ask me what I do after filming,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who is working on her third Guatemalan movie after appearing in two in the United States. \u201cI go back to normal.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy represents a new generation of Maya actors determined to hone their craft while holding onto their customs and helping expose a legacy of discrimination against Guatemala\u2019s Indigenous population.",
      "While she said she enjoys acting in the United States \u2014 and posing in a pink and blue huipil at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards \u2014 she is more interested in her own country\u2019s burgeoning film industry.",
      "But whether she\u2019s working in her homeland or Hollywood, acting can be draining, and she relies on Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas to recharge her.",
      "\u201cI love my life, but filming is physically demanding,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, relaxing on a bench in Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019s central park. \u201cThis is my community.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy\u2019s first role was the lead in a school play production of \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u201d",
      "Santa Mar\u00eda de Jesus has long been locally famous for its street theater, and a decade ago, the Guatemalan director Jayro Bustamante came to the town to prepare for his first feature film, \u201cIxcanul\u201d (\u201cVolcano\u201d). He wanted to tell a story of Maya women that addressed issues like endemic poverty and inequities in education and health care, and he was determined to cast Maya actors speaking the Indigenous language of Kaqchikel.",
      "Mr. Bustamante initially put up a sign in the town\u2019s central park: Casting Here. No one showed up. A few days later he posted: Work Here. He was overwhelmed with prospective actors.",
      "Ms. Coroy missed the audition. But a friend put her in touch with the director the next day.",
      "\u201cHe told me I was the only person who looked him in the eye,\u201d she said. When he offered her the lead, she balked. \u201cI had no experience. I was afraid I would ruin the movie.\u201d",
      "But he convinced her to join the cast. For the next several months, they trained at the country\u2019s first film academy, founded by Mr. Bustamante.",
      "\u201cWhen we began filming, they were no longer amateur actors,\u201d Mr. Bustamante said.",
      "\u201cIxcanul,\u201d which ",
      " at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, focuses on a poor family in the mountains that arranges for the daughter to marry a plantation overseer. The daughter secretly gets involved with a young man, a drunk and a dreamer, who promises to take her with him to the United States. But he leaves without her and she finds herself pregnant while still engaged to the other man.",
      "After she gives birth in a hospital, a staff member tells her that her baby has died. When the young woman finds out later that her child had lived and had possibly been sold for adoption, grief consumes her.",
      "\u201cQuiet and fearless,\u201d the Los Angeles-based film critic Manuel Betancourt wrote of Ms. Coroy\u2019s understated performance, which revealed anguish behind a still face.",
      "\u201cI mouthed the words I was feeling in my head,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, explaining her acting method. \u201cIt was easier then because I was naturally timid. I\u2019m much more animated now.\u201d",
      "Her second film with Mr. Bustamante, \u201cLa Llorona,\u201d transformed a traditional Latin American ghost story into an indictment of a fictional dictator, but one clearly reminiscent of the Guatemalan leader, Gen. Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt. Five years before ",
      ", General R\u00edos Montt was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity for the systematic slaughter of Maya men, women and children in the 1980s after he took control of the country in a coup.",
      "Ms. Coroy plays Alma, a Maya housemaid whose son and daughter were among those murdered. A spectral figure in white, she haunts the dictator in his home.",
      "A casting director saw her in the two Bustamante films and picked her for the part of an Indigenous guerrilla in \u201c",
      ",\u201d an American film starring Julianne Moore. For two-and-a-half months, Ms. Coroy filmed in Mexico and the United States, the longest she had ever been away from her family. She froze in New York, she said, and didn\u2019t like the food.",
      "The actress prefers not to discuss politics. But Mr. Bustamante said artists in Guatemala worked in an increasingly hostile climate.",
      "\u201cYou realize you\u2019re in a country where there is a dictatorship without that name,\u201d Mr. Bustamante wrote in an email interview. \u201cThere is a murky sort of oppression and no rights or freedom.\u201d",
      "When \u201cIxcanul\u201d was released, he wrote, \u201cthere was a general rejection by the Guatemalan people of this sort of subject matter. With La Llorona, it was much more dangerous. We received anonymous threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cWakanda Forever,\u201d a global blockbuster distributed by Disney, also addresses the oppression of the Maya.",
      "Ms. Coroy\u2019s character, Princess Fen, catches smallpox brought by the Spaniards to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in the 16th century. A shaman gives her a drink that allows her to live and give birth underwater. When her winged son Namor, played by the Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta, returns to the Yucat\u00e1n, he sees Spaniards beating the Maya they have enslaved.",
      "In Guatemala, some Maya families encourage their children to speak only Spanish and wear Western clothing to escape ongoing rampant discrimination. But that\u2019s not how Ms. Coroy was raised.",
      "\u201cMy parents tell me I should be proud,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who eventually returned to night school and finished college. \u201cThere is no way that you can hide that you\u2019re Indigenous.\u201d",
      "She has recently begun delving into Maya spirituality. Her grandmother was a natural healer who taught her about the curative properties or herbal teas and flowers. While she worships in a Catholic church, she also studies with an Indigenous spiritual teacher and reads the Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh.",
      "Central to Maya religion is Maxim\u00f3n, a trickster deity both benevolent and hedonistic. In ceremonies, adherents smoke and drink in front of his wooden figure in the hopes he will hear their entreaties. Ms. Coroy attends ceremonies without imbibing, she said.",
      "\u201cI respect Maxim\u00f3n,\u201d she said. \u201cI have connected with him in dreams. He said, \u2018You neither speak well of me nor poorly, so I will protect you.\u2019\u201d",
      "While she\u2019s famous enough in Guatemala that people in the colonial tourist city of Antigua, a UNESCO World heritage site, approach her politely for autographs, her neighbors in Santa Mar\u00eda avoid singling her out. Walking in the town\u2019s park, she might as well be any other vendor.",

The couple, who have three children (and a fourth on the way), looked for homes in Westfield, Mountainside, Madison and other communities, but \u201cfinding a four-bedroom house in the $500,000 range was just unheard-of in those towns,\u201d Mr. Montano said.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t find Coxsackie \u2014 I found the house,\u201d said Mr. Readence, an executive coach for a large consulting firm, who now splits his time between Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Coxsackie. \u201cAfter sheltering for four months in an 800-square-foot apartment with my partner and our dog, I was on Zillow looking for places in the upstate area. When we saw the cottage and the town and learned a little more about it, it was really appealing to be a part of its renaissance.\u201d",
      "Perched on the west bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles south of Albany, Coxsackie covers roughly 37 square miles \u2014 including an eponymous 2.17-square-mile village \u2014 with a population of 8,382, according to the 2020 census. The nearly five-acre Riverside Park, adjacent to the downtown area, offers stunning views.",
      "\u201cYou just have beautiful, open park space and the most pristine riverfront,\u201d said Aaron Flach, 47, a developer and a Coxsackie native. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful natural landscape that sets us apart from any other community.\u201d",
      "Just a few years ago, Coxsackie\u2019s historic downtown was pocked with boarded-up buildings. Now the Reed Street Historic District has boutique businesses like the Reed Street Bottle Shop and the antiques store UnQuiet. On a six-acre riverside site, Mr. Flach is building a $15 million hospitality project that includes a 47-room hotel with a top-floor restaurant and deck, and a spa inside a restored electric light station. Last November, he opened a 13,000-square-foot event space in a 1906 factory adjoining the hotel site, with a glass atrium overlooking the river. Called The Wire, after the wire manufacturer that once owned the building, it has 27 events booked so far in 2023.",
      "The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation recently made $3.2 million worth of improvements to Riverside Park, including the construction of a pavilion and renovations to the boat launch. And in 2021, the state\u2019s Main Street grant program awarded $347,000 to the Reed Street Historic District to help preserve and protect its buildings.",
      "\u201cBetween Mr. Flach\u2019s project and the park, our entire riverfront area will have been renovated,\u201d said Mark Evans, 57, a Coxsackie native who has been the mayor of the village since 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place on the Hudson.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach, he added, is renovating buildings that \u201chad been vacant since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "The boutique shops popping up in historic buildings near the waterfront have helped the area approach \u201ccritical mass,\u201d said Sarah Gray Miller, 51, a former magazine editor and self-described \u201cmad collector\u201d from Natchez, Miss., who opened UnQuiet in December 2021 after selling her house in nearby ",
      "Her store occupies a 2,400-square-foot, late-19th-century brick building, once the site of a firehouse and a jail, which Ms. Miller rents for $2,500 a month.",
      "Ms. Miller began serving customers wine on Saturday afternoons and soon found herself holding a regular B.Y.O.B. gathering that evolved into a plan to open a bar with Mark Deubert, a fourth-generation Coxsackie resident. Named Ravish Liquors, after a neon sign Ms. Miller found at a Hudson, N.Y., flea market, it is expected to open this month with a Southern bar-food menu that includes crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e.",
      "Coxsackie \u201cis a very civilized place,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly welcoming to all the outsiders moving in. It does not have the same us-versus-them mentality that you see elsewhere in Greene County.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach bought the waterfront property he is developing from the Twelve Tribes \u2014 a ",
      " that runs a chain of cafes called the Yellow Deli, including one in downtown Coxsackie \u2014 for $1 million, along with an 1860s opera house where he plans to create first-floor retail space and 10 apartments. \u201cThis is a huge project for such a small community,\u201d said Mr. Flach, who\u2019s aiming to open the hotel on June 1. \u201cI want to develop a level of vibrancy for the downtown that will bring tourists to the area and support local businesses.\u201d",
      "He also owns more than 100 apartments in town, including two historic brick buildings from the 1880s, and said they are all occupied, with waiting lists.",
      "Historic homes predominate in the village. Outside the village, Coxsackie\u2019s architecture is a mix of styles, with a number of Greek Revival farmhouses reflecting the area\u2019s agrarian past.",
      "The Reed Street Historic District consists of two- and three-story Italianate brick buildings from the mid-1800s, many painted in soft pastels. Small shops that recently have sprung up include Mansion + Reed General Store, which offers specialty groceries, espresso and pastries; Shipwrecked News, Books & Caf\u00e9, which sells sandwiches, homemade bagels, used books, and just received a liquor license; and, a few doors down, the Reed Street Bottle Shop, which carries local wines and spirits, as well as T-shirts and coffee mugs emblazoned with the phonetic spelling of the town\u2019s often mispronounced name: \u201ccook-SAH-kie.\u201d",
      "Susan Baldaserini, an owner of the wine shop and a graphic artist, designed the shirts and mugs. \u201cNow a weekend doesn\u2019t go by where I don\u2019t hear someone in the shop saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s how you say it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In 2015, when Ms. Baldaserini, 43, and her boyfriend and business partner, Shai Kessler, 45, were living in Red Hook, Brooklyn, they bought a weekend house in the neighboring town of New Baltimore. They moved upstate full-time in 2016 to open the wine shop. The following year, Ms. Baldaserini opened Pilothouse Paper, a stationery store that doubles as her graphic-design studio, across the street.",
      "\u201cA lot of people travel up and down 9W without ever knowing Reed Street exists, but if you get the hot tip to turn off 9W and onto Reed Street, it\u2019s truly charming and idyllic,\u201d she said.",
      "As Coxsackie\u2019s profile has risen, so have its home prices. The median sale price for a single-family home in 2022 was $291,000 \u2014 a jump of nearly 22 percent (from $239,000) in 2021, and nearly 53 percent (from $190,500) in 2019. It was more than the $285,000 median sale price in ",
      ", and less than the $329,500 median in ",
      ", according to the Columbia Greene Board of Realtors.",
      "Taxes are relatively low. The average county, town and school tax bill for 2021 was about $4,443 for town residents and $6,188 for village residents, said Raymond Ward, the director of real property tax services for Greene County.",
      "In mid-January, Zillow showed six single-family homes for sale in Coxsackie, from a three-bedroom ranch on 0.23 acres, listed for $189,100, to a six-bedroom home on 9.33 acres along the Hudson River, listed for $899,000.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been seeing is the people who are interested in being full-time also want to either open up a business here or do a satellite of what they\u2019re already doing in the city,\u201d said Dave Merchant, a Coxsackie native and a real estate agent at Keller Williams Hudson Valley North.",
      "Amy Bennett, who owns two businesses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, is shopping for commercial space in Coxsackie to open a farm stand. She splits her time between her Fort Greene brownstone and her Coxsackie house, but plans to spend most of her time upstate once her younger daughter graduates from high school. In addition to Greene Grape Wine & Spirits and Greene Grape Provisions, she owns five properties in Athens, including 58 acres of farmland.",
      "\u201cCoxsackie feels like it\u2019s got big energy from the waterfront development,\u201d said Ms. Bennett, 53, who bought her three-bedroom Victorian house with river views for $375,000 in May 2021. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a bigger rejuvenation going on all at once.\u201d",
      "She likes to grab coffee at Shipwrecked, pick up cream puffs at the Little Bake Shop on Mansion Street and explore the Coxsackie Antique Center in the West Coxsackie business district on Route 9W, where more than 100 antiques dealers sell their wares. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you want for a rainy Saturday, to wander through and see things you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d she said.",
      "Students in the Coxsackie-Athens Central School District attend either Coxsackie Elementary School or Edward J. Arthur Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade. They go on to Coxsackie-Athens Middle School for fifth through eighth grade, and then to Coxsackie-Athens High School.",
      "During the 2020-21 school year, the latest year for which figures were available from the New York State Education Department, the district had an enrollment of 1,188 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. About 85 percent identified as white, 8 percent as Hispanic, 5 percent as multiracial, 2 percent as Black and 1 percent as Asian or Pacific Islander.",
      "On 2021-22 state tests, 86 percent of Coxsackie-Athens High School students were proficient in English, 34 percent were proficient in algebra and 54 percent were proficient in geometry, compared with 81 percent, 66 percent and 53 percent statewide. In 2022, the average SAT verbal score was 546, compared with a statewide average of 534; the average math score was 542, versus 533 statewide.",
      "The high school\u2019s graduation rate in 2021 was 89 percent, compared with 86 percent for the state.",
      "Coxsackie is roughly a seven-minute drive from Exit 21B on the New York State Thruway. The drive to the George Washington Bridge takes about two hours, depending on traffic.",
      "The Amtrak train station in Hudson is about a 25-minute drive. Round-trip tickets to New York City cost $62 to $148, depending on when the ticket is bought and whether it is for peak or off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cThe train back on Thursday or Friday is often booked, because the area has gotten so popular,\u201d Ms. Miller said.",
      "The New York State Legislature created the town of Coxsackie in 1788, and the village was incorporated in 1867. The name is derived from an Algonquin word and has had many spellings and various translations over the years, including \u201choot of the owl,\u201d said Michael H. Rausch, the town historian. Coxsackie is also associated with ",

It became a commercial hub, shipping local goods to New York City, Mr. Rausch said. The business district, including Reed Street, began to develop around 1810.",

      "On a recent Monday afternoon at York University in Toronto, Dr. Christina Sharpe was waiting for her students to arrive. Campus felt sleepy, blanketed in snow from a recent storm. They trickled in, arranging themselves around the classroom. That week they were discussing ",
      " No one in attendance had read the book before.",
      "Sharpe pulled out her copy, which she has had for more than 30 years and keeps carefully sheathed in protective plastic. Sharpe, who is 57, sat poised in a black tunic over black pants and boots, her red lips immaculate. She smoothed a hand over the well-worn cover. The book was fat with stickie notes and tabs, its pages so marked up with highlights, exclamations, notes and annotations that it resembled a devotional.",
      "Historically, narratives about slavery prioritized white readers, displaying atrocities to rouse support for abolition. Morrison\u2019s fifth novel, in contrast, focuses on the interiority of the enslaved and formerly enslaved, placing the textures of their lives at the center of the story. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this book for a long time,\u201d Sharpe told the class. It \u201ccompletely rewired how one could write and think about slavery.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeloved,\u201d at its core, is a story of multiple hauntings: The remnants of trauma left in those forced to be property, the fury of a petulant baby-spirit that seems to come back from the dead to find the mother who killed her rather than let her be taken into enslavement. The book holds horrors, but it also raises questions about the beginning of freedom time. \u201cFreeing yourself was one thing,\u201d Morrison writes, \u201cbut claiming ownership of that freed self was another.\u201d The work of embodiment, belonging and rest become the central themes for the characters and, by extension, the readers. For Sharpe, \u201cBeloved\u201d is rich in techniques for refusing the logic of slavery. One of those is infanticide; another, Sharpe shared with the class, is love.",
      "She held the book aloft and read the title aloud: \u201cBeloved.\u201d She paused and reframed the word for us. \u201cBe loved.\u201d The name of the book, Sharpe told the class, is \u201can injunction, a command, a wish, a plea, a lamentation.\u201d To love the self, to believe the self worthy of love and to let that love radiate out and fill up others around you.",
      "A thick silence settled over the classroom as the students absorbed the force of the revelation. The first and final words of the book were not merely an epitaph on a grave: They were instructions for living. Be loved. What I was witnessing, I later realized, was more than a lecture. It was a portal into Sharpe\u2019s methodology. \u201cI think with \u2018Beloved\u2019 almost every day,\u201d she later told me.",
      "Like Morrison, Sharpe \u2014 who is a professor of English literature and Black studies \u2014 is intent on showing how language is like a knife: a tool or weapon depending on who is wielding it. She also understands the way terms like \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201canti-Blackness\u201d run the risk of losing their potency as they become more familiar and commonplace. Sharpe refuses the devaluation of these words and resuscitates them with her critical analysis and poetic reflections.",
      "The book Sharpe is best known for, ",
      " landed in the fall of 2016, just as the final delusions of a post-racial America were disintegrating amid the rise of white nationalism. The book begins with a stark declaration: Black death is foundational \u2014 even necessary \u2014 to American democracy. Death, literally, but also spiritually, culturally, socially. Sharpe is not the first academic, poet or artist to assert that the negation of Black humanity that began with the Middle Passage is still animating American life, but she offered a new metaphorical framework for understanding how.",
      "\u201cIn the Wake\u201d roiled the academic world. It appeared during a \u201craging and at times venomous debate between Black optimism and Black pessimism,\u201d says Saidiya Hartman, author of \u201cWayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments,\u201d who met Sharpe nearly a decade ago at a conference and has become a close friend. \u201cChristina\u2019s work totally unsettles that binary. She addresses the structural conditions of anti-Blackness that condemn Black people on a variety of levels and still attends to the richness of Black social living, and it is an essential contribution.\u201d Sharpe is part of a cohort of thinkers and artists \u2014 including Hartman, Arthur Jafa, Fred Moten, Simone Leigh, Garrett Bradley, Ja\u2019Tovia Gary, Lorraine O\u2019Grady and others \u2014 who are interrogating the rendering of Blackness in American culture and offering new ways of looking, seeing and being seen.",
      " Sharpe lays out an exploded view of the word \u201cwake.\u201d One definition is the disturbance a boat leaves behind as it moves through water. What would it mean to understand all of American life as still caught in the wake, still caught in the undertow of the ships that carried the enslaved? Sharpe also put forth the metaphors of the ship (the processes by which Black people are still seen as property), the hold (the ways that captivity and punishment are still central to Black life) and the weather (the ambient anti-Blackness that is as pervasive as climate).",
      "The word wake invokes the funereal, yet Sharpe also summons the celebratory nature of a wake, the ways Black people find \u201can insistence on existence\u201d through family, music, dance, community and art. This she calls \u201cwake work.\u201d Her aim is not to suffuse people with a sense of despair, she told me, but to galvanize them to \u201cturn our attention elsewhere.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t mourn and don\u2019t grieve,\u201d she told me, but rather to stop expecting redemption, validation and justice from white society and institutions.",
      "Sharpe never directly mentions the word \u201cwoke,\u201d an idiom that has been used as far back as the 1930s to mean readiness and watchfulness. In recent years, the word has been weaponized as a rallying cry against progressive ideas and policies. Its inevitable perversion is implied in the book\u2019s central premise. Woke is caught in the wake too, its fate a warning about just how powerful the churn behind those ships can be.",
      "Sharpe\u2019s latest book, ",
      " which was published in April, is her most liberating and poetic experiment yet. Made up of 248 individual notes, it is a deft blend of memoir, theory, archival documents and lyrical reflections on her daily life. It also includes Sharpe\u2019s photographs of moody skyscapes, images of flowers, family photographs, art installations and paintings.",
      "There is wonder (Note 133, marveling at a rare photograph of her mother and grandmother, leaning sweetly against each other, her mother\u2019s hands gracefully cupped, Sharpe asks, \u201cWhere did she learn that?\u201d); personal history (Note 195, on a nervous tic developed in graduate school of strangling herself when she spoke: \u201cSpeech and speechlessness; each one has a cost\u201d); cultural criticism (Note 27, after visiting the Legacy Museum in Alabama, which features a photo wall showcasing historical images of white violence: \u201cHow many more lookings?\u201d); meditations on archival work (Note 185, on collective memory: \u201cWe have to function as a living library; as an institution\u201d).",
      "The notes build in momentum and assemble themselves into a mosaic that holds the relentless terror of Black life as well as its undeniable beauty. \u201cI wanted them to have a certain kind of force and velocity and accumulation,\u201d she told me. By turning her gaze inward, Sharpe offers a framework for understanding how to move forward, even when burdened by all the knowledge of the world\u2019s cruelty. (Note 106: \u201cYou do not have to save the things that kill you.\u201d)",
      " class, Sharpe welcomed me into her home. It felt sturdy, like a farmhouse. A mantel held candles, flowers and artwork by a friend, the abstract painter ",
      ", who Sharpe says renders Blackness with \u201cbreath and air.\u201d She set out a lime green tray of fresh figs, bright orange clementines, crispy grapes and a fragrant tea served in delicate floral cups. The mantel and dining table were covered with fresh flowers: red tulips and scalloped pink ranunculus the size of baby cabbages. At the edge of my view, the tips of deciduous trees were patiently waiting out winter.",
      "Sharpe has lived in Toronto for the last five years, drawn in part by her partner, the poet ",
      ", who has lived there since she was 17. Brand was in Tobago for the winter, and Sharpe and I arranged ourselves around a coffee table covered in books by photographers and scholars working in the African diaspora, including ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      ". Her voice is soft and girlish except when she breaks into a full-throated laugh that takes over her whole body, her careful regality surrendering momentarily to spontaneous delight.",
      "Sharpe told me that the idea of \u201cOrdinary Notes\u201d came from a scene in \u201cBeloved\u201d depicting a character who tries to escape enslavement only to end up in a Georgia prison. Each morning and evening, another incarcerated man calls out a clear, high note signaling the start and end of their day. He is called Hi Man. Hi Man\u2019s offering are the notes of humanity amid grisly conditions of bone-breaking labor and sexual assault. To Sharpe, this \u201csounding of care\u201d is an offering of generosity and presence despite untenable circumstances, and it is enough to sustain the men until their eventual escape. Her book is a prismatic examination of all the notes in her own life \u2014 the ones that sound care and the ones that don\u2019t \u2014 and how knowing the difference offers a kind of sanity.",
      "\u201cHow to find the words and grammars we can live in?\u201d she asked, and paused. \u201cBecause we do live in them. How to keep working in the knowledge that we do make them and we do live in them?\u201d",
      "Sharpe gave me a tour of the artwork in her home, much of which is the byproduct of a collaboration. She is an art critic and has contributed to the monographs of some of the most important artists of our time, including ",
      " ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      ". There was a drawing by Saar and a painting by ",
      ". A framed print called \u201cVanishing Act,\u201d by the artist ",
      ", caught my eye. In her first book, \u201cMonstrous Intimacies,\u201d Sharpe writes extensively on Walker\u2019s work to reveal how society is programmed to default to racist narratives. Sharpe and Walker are connected through their mutual desire to understand the \u201cdisfiguration of blackness and whiteness\u201d and the consequences of denying our shared complicity in the way the past still shapes the present.",
      "In Walker\u2019s print, a woman kneels before a rapt audience, devouring a small child. The title refers to a sleight of hand, a trick performed by a magician, but the vanishing in this image involves cannibalism. The setting \u2014 a stage \u2014 and their dated clothing \u2014 petticoats and stockings \u2014 recall minstrelsy. The hands of both figures, even the person being eaten, are relaxed, complicating the relationship between exploiter and exploited. The work in Sharpe\u2019s office, like many of Walker\u2019s famous prints and sculptures, is devoid of color. One could make assumptions about the figures and their respective races, but the only clues are drawn from historical characterizations of Black people (the older woman is wearing a head scarf). Over the last two decades, Walker has been attacked by critics for reproducing racist tropes, but that outrage is misdirected. It is the presuppositions that viewers bring to the work that are so repellent, not the figures themselves. In \u201cVanishing Act,\u201d it is impossible to tell who is the victor and who is the victim. Only their acceptance of what they\u2019re doing, and perhaps the pleasure they\u2019re taking in doing it, is truly legible.",
      "The more time I spend with Sharpe\u2019s work, the more it inflects my ways of seeing the world. According to Sharpe, Blackness is anagrammatical, meaning that the structures that order language, thought and society become disordered \u2014 if not destroyed entirely \u2014 when they encounter Blackness. \u201cHer work has shown that we, as Black people, are the foils of humanity,\u201d Frank B. Wilderson III, author of \u201cAfropessimism,\u201d told me. \u201cIf humanity defines itself against us, what does it mean for us to live every day as the anti-human?\u201d",
      "In my daily life, I\u2019ve been interrogating headlines, interactions, film, TV and visual art with a radar attuned to the frequency of Sharpe. The Kansas City Police not immediately taking Andrew Lester into custody after he ",

      " and Black models for free labor \u2014 the ship, the hold and the wake.",
      " Sharpe\u2019s parents, Ida Wright Sharpe and Van Buren Sharpe Jr., moved from West Philadelphia to Wayne, Pa. \u201cThey wanted what they both imagined and knew that they did not have,\u201d she writes. A home big enough for the family that would eventually grow to six children, a yard, access to good schools and proverbial opportunities. Her mother worked in a department store and her father was a mail sorter and chef. Sharpe was born in 1965. Her eldest sibling was almost 22 years her senior, and by the time her sibling who was closest in age went to college, she was 11. It was lonely. \u201cI mostly felt like an only child,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Ida, doted on her and gifted her \u201ca love of words,\u201d inscribing books to her daughter in her ornate script. Ida also gave her the gift of time to get lost in them. Sharpe read \u201cThe People Could Fly,\u201d \u201cSong of Solomon\u201d and \u201cLittle Women\u201d for hours, curled up in a roomy windowsill in the house. In the spring, she collected wild violets for her mother who used them to make jelly. In lieu of trips to the ballet or theater, Ida hosted Sunday salons where she served poundcake and tea, and mother and daughter read poetry to each other.",
      "An idea that reverberates in all of Sharpe\u2019s work is that you might be forced to live in subjugation but that does not mean only living life as a subjugated person. \u201cThat is what I always want to animate,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny the violence. But that\u2019s not the only way we encounter each other.\u201d Beauty, pleasure and the \u201cspace to dream\u201d (Note 51) were forces applied steadily to a young Sharpe, counteracting all that threatened to destabilize her self-worth. \u201cI marvel at my mother\u2019s commitment to joy,\u201d she told me. That joy made Sharpe possible. The final note in Ordinary Notes reads, \u201cThis is a love letter to my mother.\u201d",
      "But what happened inside the Sharpe home was one thing. What happened outside it was another. \u201cThings were not better in this \u2018new world,\u2019\u201d she writes. In person, she tells me that her experiences as a young girl in Wayne were \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "In \u201cOrdinary Notes,\u201d Sharpe recalls photographs of white terror \u2014 people screaming from the sidelines of a school and neighborhood integration, the Charlottesville tiki torches in 2017. They dredge up something dormant for her. \u201cHis face is an open-mouthed rictus of hatred,\u201d she writes in Note 5. \u201cI felt I knew it.\u201d The next note includes a heartbreakingly tender photograph of Sharpe as a little girl, hair in plaits, smile broad and unbroken, for the moment.",
      "\u201cIt was not a happy time,\u201d she said, falling silent.",
      "When she was almost 12, her father died. Money became scarce. Bills went unpaid, winters were spent without heat, repairs to the house went undone. Throughout, her mother cultivated beauty. Forsythia, cut from the yard, arranged in a vase, served as a welcome distraction from a ceiling that was falling down. Mustard greens, corn and tomatoes from the garden supplemented meals, and beautifully rolled logs made from paper were burned for heat. During Sharpe\u2019s first semester as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, her mother was unable to make a payment, and the school threatened to kick her out. That experience indelibly shaped her, but so did the teachers, many of them Black, she met during that time.",
      "Sharpe enrolled in the English Ph.D. program at Cornell University \u2014 \u201cso I\u2019d have the most time and space to think and learn\u201d \u2014 and planned to start an independent Black middle school in West Philadelphia. In our conversation, she declined to revisit her time at the university in detail, but she re-enacted a ",
      ", who asked her about her decision to leave the United States in 1972. Simone, in pearls and gold eye shadow, answers before he can finish the question. \u201cRACISM,\u201d she announces, her contralto voice almost belting out the word to eject it more forcefully from her body. Sharpe\u2019s impression is uncanny. \u201cThey were a trip,\u201d she told me.",
      "In academia at that time, personal experience and knowledge were viewed as inauthentic forms of scholarship, and those who tried to incorporate these elements into their work were deterred. It was disparagingly called \u201cmesearch.\u201d \u201cI was trained as an academic; you don\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite everything we know about objectivity, we were not encouraged to include ourselves in particular ways.\u201d Still, she left her mark by advocating for more diverse teachers, pressing the university to bring in more Chicana, Asian and Native professors, which they did.",
      " of academia took a toll on her confidence, keeping her stagnant longer than she imagined possible. \u201cThere\u2019s criticism that is meant to help you and there is criticism that is meant to stop you,\u201d she told me, with a leveling look. During this time, her mother died. She fell into a deep depression. (Note 156: \u201cIt was as if I\u2019d lost my center of gravity.\u201d) She lay in bed so long she developed a sore. Once again, her mother intervened. She had given young Christina a book on North American birds, and turning her gaze skyward had become a passion. She returned to the hobby while mourning; looking up was a way out.",
      "In 1998, she was hired at Tufts University, later becoming the first Black woman to get tenure in the English department and the only one during her time there to be promoted to a full professorship. It took nearly 20 years.",
      "invitation for a conference called Loophole of Retreat, scheduled for early October in Venice alongside the Biennale, began circulating online. The sculptor Simone Leigh, who represented the United States at the art fair, hosted the convening as part of her presentation (it was organized by the curator Rashida Bumbray), and Sharpe was among the more than 60 scholars and thinkers enlisted to share their work.",
      "Leigh, like Sharpe, is invested in the project of wresting back control of Black imagery from its historic (and continued) abuse without reproducing past terrors and trauma. The towering scale of her magisterial sculptures commands an indisputable authority rarely afforded to Black women. They \u2014 and she \u2014 author their own narratives; they validate their own importance.",
      "The conference took its name from a phrase that the writer Harriet Jacobs used in \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\u201d to describe the seven years she spent hiding in a crawl space that was so cramped it left her permanently disabled. Yet she still claimed the tiny attic as a site of independence, a place to dream and plot strategies for freedom until she could enact them. Italy is a complicated place to undertake practices of freedom, in part because of the routine deaths of African migrants who drown seeking refuge in the country. Participants in the conference invoked the connection between Jacobs\u2019s confinement and the modern-day horrors experienced regularly.",
      "One of the conference\u2019s themes was maroonage, referring to people who escaped slavery to build their own independent communities on the outskirts of society. For those three days, the tiny lush island off the coast of Venice where the convening took place became its own planet, accruing a powerful density anchored by hundreds of Black people, mostly women, who flew from all corners of the world to participate. Scholarly presentations lived alongside films about utopian Detroit and about Drexciya, a mythological aqueous society, and emotional readings about Black motherhood. The convening suggested that the potential for Black sovereignty was more than just an idea; it had already arrived.",
      "On the first day, Sharpe took the stage to read excerpts from \u201cOrdinary Notes\u201d inside a large, ornate hall, dressed in a blue striped tunic layered over a multicolored turtleneck. It was the first time many in attendance were getting a preview of the successor to \u201cIn the Wake,\u201d and the room crackled with anticipation.",
      "She read a series of notes about a photograph of her mother and a moving encounter with a man she witnessed kneeling on the ground on an earlier trip to Venice. Sharpe closed her reading with Note 175: \u201cTenderness might just be a gesture, it might just be a look, a Black look, some regard, relayed between people in peril.\u201d",
      "Care, as practiced by Sharpe, means small gestures that acknowledge one another\u2019s humanity. It means cultivating an awareness of the possibility of re-enacting violence even while trying to critique it. The time in Venice felt imbued with such care. It was a pause from the abjection that many of its attendees experience on a regular basis; a temporary space to practice methods of consideration, decadence and stillness. On those grounds, in this collection of moments, Sharpe\u2019s theories sharpened into focus. Freedom and love will never come from white society: They must be obtained by the self and also exchanged freely among ourselves.",
      "One note that has most stuck with me, Note 96, describes an interaction between Sharpe and a young woman who works in the cafe in the Tate Modern in London. Sharpe pauses to say hello. The greeting doesn\u2019t register. Sharpe tries again. Finally, the woman draws herself into the moment. She tells Sharpe that she has been working at the museum for months and no one had ever spoken to her beyond asking her to do something. She thanks her for \u201cseeing me and asking about me.\u201d Sharpe records the reminder of their interaction as follows:",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018I see you.\u2019",
      "She says, \u2018I know.\u2019",
      "I say, \u2018We see each other.\u2019",
      "She says, \u2018Yes. We do.\u2019\u201d",
      "(Note 181: \u201cRegard is a habit of care. It is appreciation and esteem. It is the right of repair.\u201d )",
      "If there\u2019s an argument at the center of \u201cOrdinary Notes,\u201d it is that attentiveness and imagination are powerful restorative agents capable of reconstituting what has been broken down and targeted for obliteration. I often think back to that time in Venice, suspended in motion, embodying survival and sustenance. I felt carried along by a great momentum, perhaps on another kind of vessel, powering us toward the beyond.",
      "Mickalene Thomas is an artist known for her paintings of African American women that combine historical, political and pop culture references. She uses photography often to examine complex notions of femininity while challenging common definitions of beauty and aesthetic representations of women in recontextualized interior settings."

      "When the former secretary of state and C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo, a man who had dealt firsthand with autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, described Randi Weingarten as \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d last November, it seemed as though he couldn\u2019t possibly be serious.",
      "Weingarten is 65 and just over five feet tall. She is Jewish and openly gay \u2014 she\u2019s married to a rabbi \u2014 and lives in Upper Manhattan. She is the longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, which is not even the country\u2019s biggest union of public-school educators. (The A.F.T. has 1.7 million members; the National Education Association has three million.) The A.F.T. did give in excess of $26 million to Democratic candidates and causes in the 2022 election cycle, but the Carpenters and Joiners union gave more than twice as much.",
      "Pompeo, whose remarks appeared in a widely quoted interview with the online news site Semafor, had nevertheless put his finger on something: The pandemic and the ongoing culture wars over race and gender had shifted America\u2019s educational landscape, and with it the political landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s not a close call,\u201d ",
      " \u201cIf you ask, \u2018Who\u2019s the most likely to take this republic down?\u2019 It would be the teachers\u2019 unions, and the filth that they\u2019re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don\u2019t know math and reading or writing.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans quickly piled on. Pompeo had set the bar high, and they needed to invoke equally hot rhetoric and florid imagery to ensure headlines of their own. \u201cBig labor unions have taken over public education,\u201d Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina told Fox News in late January. \u201cThat\u2019s bad for parents, bad for kids, bad for America.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida mounted his attack in The American Conservative magazine: \u201cOur schools are a cesspool of Marxist indoctrination. Dangerous academic constructs like critical race theory and radical gender theory are being forced on elementary school children.\u201d Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had already garnered national attention with his book bans, Florida\u2019s \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d and its so-called Don\u2019t Say Gay legislation, unveiled a new proposal designed to rein in \u201coverreaching teachers\u2019 unions,\u201d which a column on the Fox website enthusiastically embraced as \u201ca blueprint to dominate union bosses.\u201d ",
      " \u201chave been taken over by the radical left maniacs\u201d and \u201cpink-haired communists,\u201d released his own plan to Save American Education. It was clear that Weingarten had come to stand for something much larger than herself.",
      "The last few years have been historically convulsive ones for education in America. Some 1.3 million children left the public schools during the pandemic. The results from the most recent ",
      " \u2014 known as the nation\u2019s report card \u2014 revealed the largest average score decline in reading since 1990 and the first average score decline in math since 1969. Schools have reported major increases in rates of student depression, anxiety and trauma. School districts around the country are experiencing severe teacher shortages. Last fall, a Gallup poll found that the percentage of ",
      " to 42 percent, a 20-year low.",
      "This crisis has political consequences. The pandemic closures and classroom culture wars have fueled the revival of the dormant school-choice movement, with Republican-led states around the country passing an array of far-reaching ",
      ". These bills come in different forms but share a common goal: to enable parents to move their children out of America\u2019s government-run education system en masse. All of the prospective Republican presidential candidates for 2024 have committed to building on this growing movement, whose roots can be traced back more than 50 years, to the battle over desegregation. The same pandemic closures that demonstrated how central public schools are to the communities they serve also became the inciting event for an unprecedented effort to dismantle them.",
      "The public-education system may not be very popular right now, but both Democrats and Republicans tend to like their local schools and their children\u2019s teachers. The unions that represent those teachers, however, are more polarizing. One reason for this is that they are actively involved in partisan politics, and, more specifically, are closely aligned with the Democrats, a reality powerfully driven home during the pandemic. A study by Brown University\u2019s Annenberg Institute found that Democratic districts, with correspondingly ",
      " more slowly and gradually than Republican districts with weaker unions. In some ways, Randi Weingarten and the A.F.T. \u2014 the union \u201cboss\u201d and \u201cbig labor\u201d \u2014 are a logical, even inevitable target for the G.O.P.",
      "A frequent knock on the A.F.T. is that it puts teachers before students, a framing neatly encapsulated by a quote attributed to the union\u2019s former president Al Shanker: \u201cWhen schoolchildren start paying union dues, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll start representing the interests of schoolchildren.\u201d Shanker\u2019s biographer, Richard Kahlenberg, found no record of Shanker\u2019s ever saying this and doesn\u2019t think he ever did, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the union\u2019s critics from citing it. Weingarten has a rebuttal: Good working conditions for teachers make good learning conditions for students. But Weingarten does in fact represent teachers, not students. Often, such as when it comes to issues like classroom size or school budgets, their interests align. Sometimes they don\u2019t. ",
      "For a period during the pandemic, the two groups\u2019 apparent interests diverged, and a series of fault lines started opening across the country, separating not only Republicans from Democrats but also parents from teachers, centrist Democrats from progressives and urban Black parents from suburban white parents, and even dividing the teachers\u2019 union itself. These fault lines widened as the reopening debates merged into fights over how schools should deal with the teaching of the country\u2019s racial history as well as sexuality and gender identity.",
      "What became increasingly clear to me over the last several months, as I spoke to dozens of politicians, political consultants, union leaders, parent activists and education scholars about the convulsions in American education, is that it\u2019s no longer possible to separate education from politics, and that public schools are more vulnerable than they\u2019ve ever been. How did Randi Weingarten wind up at the center of the 2024 Republican primary? The only way to answer that question is to re-examine America\u2019s education wars and the competing political agendas that are driving them. \u201cOh, goodness, no! Not at all!\u201d Pompeo answered when I asked if he was, perhaps, being hyperbolic in his remarks about Weingarten. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Ms. Weingarten, but she has been the most visible face of the destruction of American education.\u201d",
      "early months of the pandemic, teachers were celebrated as essential workers, heroically continuing to serve America\u2019s children from their homes, often with limited resources and inadequate technology. But during the summer of 2020, things started to shift. There was already early research showing that students were suffering academically from remote learning. Schools across Europe had begun reopening without any major outbreaks, and many of America\u2019s private and parochial schools were making plans to resume in-person learning at the start of the new school year. A lot of public-school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom, too. But many teachers seemed resistant to the idea.",
      "Because of the decentralized structure of America\u2019s public-education system, which has some 14,000 different school districts, the federal government could not order schools to reopen for in-person learning, but in July 2020, President ",
      " from those that didn\u2019t. His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, echoed his sentiments, demanding that the nation\u2019s schools be \u201cfully operational\u201d by the fall without providing a specific plan for doing so.",
      "Many members of the A.F.T. remained worried about putting themselves, their families and their communities at risk. The A.F.T. had issued its ",
      " in late April, calling for adequate personal protective equipment, a temporary suspension of formal teacher performance evaluations, a limit on student testing, a cancellation of student-loan debt and a $750 billion federal aid package to help schools prepare to reopen safely and facilitate \u201ca real recovery for all our communities.\u201d Weingarten did not believe the Trump administration was giving schools what teachers needed to return to work safely. She publicly denounced Trump and DeVos\u2019s call to reopen as \u201creckless,\u201d \u201ccallous\u201d and \u201ccruel,\u201d and the A.F.T. passed a resolution supporting local strikes if schools were forced to reopen in areas where a variety of safety conditions hadn\u2019t been met. As if to underscore the point, some ",
      "Florida became a test case. Even as the state\u2019s Covid death rate was surging in July, its Department of Education issued an emergency order requiring schools to fully reopen in August. The state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, the Florida Education Association, affiliated with both the A.F.T. and the N.E.A., sued DeSantis and his education commissioner, Richard Corcoran, among others, to block the reopenings, arguing that the order violated the state\u2019s Constitution, which guarantees Florida residents the right to \u201csafe\u201d and \u201csecure\u201d public schools. At a virtual news conference announcing the lawsuit, Weingarten accused DeSantis of being in \u201cintense denial.\u201d After some Florida schools started reopening, an A.F.T. political action committee produced a ",
      " citing claims that schools were becoming superspreader sites and that children were being used as \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d ",
      "As the lawsuit was working its way through the legal system \u2014 the union won in the lower court but lost on appeal \u2014 Florida was holding its biannual school-board elections, and the prospective return to in-person learning became the defining issue in many races. In Brevard County, Tina Descovich, the incumbent, was in favor of an immediate return to the classroom and opposed mask mandates. She was challenged by a public-school speech-language pathologist, Jennifer Jenkins, who called for a more cautious approach, including a mask mandate for all but the youngest children. ",
      "Jenkins easily won the late-August election, but Descovich was just getting started. She called Tiffany Justice, a fellow school-board member in nearby Indian River County, to suggest that they create their own parents\u2019 rights group, Moms for Liberty. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something here,\u201d Justice recalled Descovich\u2019s telling her. \u201cWe have to help these parents because they\u2019re trying to step up and speak out, and the schools are just slamming them at every turn.\u201d",
      "Other parents across the political spectrum started organizing, too. Many public schools hadn\u2019t fully reopened for the start of the new school year, and they were frustrated. They wrote op-eds, held rallies or met via Zoom with school-board members and other elected officials, often finding themselves at odds with local teachers\u2019 unions and union-backed school-board members. The first fault lines had started to open.",
      "the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement had prompted a national reckoning over race, as well as an ensuing backlash. The politics of the pandemic had begun to merge with the culture wars, and both were playing out most vividly in the American classroom. An esoteric academic term \u2014 critical race theory, or C.R.T. \u2014 had improbably become the rallying cry for a conservative campaign focused on the teaching of the nation\u2019s racial history. President Trump, running for re-election, eagerly took up the cause, blaming \u201cdecades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools\u201d for the Black Lives Matter protests and urging America\u2019s parents to fight back against efforts to teach their children \u201chateful lies about this country.\u201d",
      "The ",
      " committing publicly to the fight to end \u201csystemic racism in America.\u201d Some of the A.F.T.\u2019s locals went further. The Chicago Teachers Union took to the streets to demand that the city\u2019s board of education cancel a $33 million contract between Chicago\u2019s public schools and its Police Department for the safety officers who staff the city\u2019s public schools. United Teachers Los Angeles helped lead a successful fight to press its school district to slash its police budget by $25 million and use the money instead to hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers.",
      "That October, Weingarten embarked on a cross-country bus tour to get out the vote for Joe Biden. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, had not always been in sync with the A.F.T.; the union opposed elements of Obama\u2019s Race to the Top program, which sent money to states that reformed their public-education systems by, among other things, weakening teacher tenure, introducing data-driven accountability measures and adding more nonunionized charter schools. Biden, by contrast, vowed to focus on neighborhood public schools rather than charters and criticized the standardized-testing regimes and teacher evaluations that were a hallmark of Race to the Top. Weingarten\u2019s name was even floated as a candidate for secretary of education. She didn\u2019t get the job, but she and the head of the N.E.A., Becky Pringle, were invited to the White House on the day after Biden\u2019s inauguration. The teachers\u2019 unions finally had a true ally in the Oval Office. The first lady, Jill Biden, taught at a public community college herself. (",
      " President Biden would later quip.) The new administration gave teachers preferential access to the Covid vaccine, behind some other essential workers but ahead of the general population. Biden had pledged to quickly reopen America\u2019s schools, and the A.F.T. was communicating with top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about its guidelines for doing so, suggesting that the agency add a provision allowing for its recommendations to be revisited if a highly contagious Covid variant emerged. But the anger that had been unleashed by the pandemic closures and the culture wars had not abated.",
      "Justice and Descovich, the former Florida school-board members, incorporated Moms for Liberty in early 2021 with a far more ambitious and political agenda than simply advocating a return to maskless, in-person classes. As the group\u2019s mission statement explained, it was \u201cdedicated to fighting for the survival of America by unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.\u201d The group built its brand with bumper magnets and T-shirts emblazoned with the motto \u201cWe Do NOT Co-Parent With the Government.\u201d It was embraced by the right-wing media and then by donors eager to turn it into a national movement, while nurturing its grass-roots image, mirroring the model created by the Tea Party, the quasi-populist uprising fueled by conservative billionaires and Fox News. The former Fox host Megyn Kelly headlined a fund-raising event in Florida, speaking about, as Justice recalled, \u201cthe woke ideology\u201d coming out of America\u2019s classrooms. Moms for Liberty soon expanded beyond Florida. That summer, a chapter in Tennessee presented an 11-page ",
      " objecting to a curriculum that it said \u201cfocuses repeatedly and daily on very dark and divisive slivers of American history\u201d and works to \u201csow feelings of resentment, shame of one\u2019s skin color and/or fear.\u201d After several Republican states passed laws limiting the teaching of race-related subjects and banning C.R.T., Weingarten gave a speech citing a historian who had compared their efforts to the censorship of the Soviet regime. A clip of the speech spent days in heavy rotation on Fox News, and it inspired an editorial in The Wall Street Journal: ",
      " Youngkin\u2019s plan to turn Virginia\u2019s 2021 governor\u2019s race into a referendum on America\u2019s battles over education. Initially, he was just hoping to prevent his opponent, Terry McAuliffe, from owning an issue that historically favored Democrats. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to let them take the fight to us,\u201d Jeff Roe, one of Youngkin\u2019s chief strategists, told me.",
      "By almost every measure, Youngkin, a former private-equity executive with no political experience, was the underdog. McAuliffe, a Democratic stalwart dating back to the Clinton presidency, served as Virginia\u2019s governor between 2014 and 2018. (A state law barring governors from serving consecutive terms prevented him from running for re-election.)",
      "Biden had beaten Trump by 10 points in Virginia, and McAuliffe led in the early polls. But Virginia\u2019s schools had been among the last on the East Coast to fully reopen, and the lingering bitterness from these pandemic closures had formed a politically combustible mix with the rising culture wars. Amid the national racial reckoning of 2020, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County \u2014 one of the top public high schools in the nation \u2014 had jettisoned its admissions exam, prompting a lawsuit by 17 families, many of them Asian American, who viewed the change as a form of discrimination against their children.",
      "Some of the most bitter fights were unfolding in suburban Loudoun County, where a proposal to allow transgender children to choose which bathrooms and pronouns they wished to use had sparked an angry backlash among conservative parents. The tensions were later exacerbated by news of a sexual assault in a high school girls\u2019 bathroom perpetrated by a boy who was wearing a skirt at the time. Loudoun\u2019s increasingly ",

      "Youngkin held \u201cSave Our Schools\u201d rallies and pledged to ban C.R.T. from the state\u2019s schools. But his campaign\u2019s internal education polls revealed a wide range of voter priorities across the state. The race and gender issues that resonated with his base \u2014 Trump voters \u2014 weren\u2019t going to be enough to win. He microtargeted other education voters with different ads; it was a scattershot approach, though, at least until a gubernatorial debate in late September.",
      "During his tenure as governor, McAuliffe had vetoed a bill \u2014 prompted by a mother who objected to her high school senior son\u2019s reading Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved\u201d in an A.P. English class \u2014 that would have enabled parents to prevent their children from studying material they deemed sexually explicit. When Youngkin criticized that decision on the debate stage, ",
      ", \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d",
      "Recognizing that they had just been handed a political gift, Youngkin\u2019s staff cobbled together a digital and TV ad that very night, hoping to take advantage of the apparent gaffe before McAuliffe tried to clarify it. \u201cI was sure he was going to walk it back on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019\u201d Roe told me. Instead, McAuliffe stood by his comment, saying that states and local school boards should have authority over what\u2019s taught in schools.",
      "Youngkin unified his diffuse education campaign under a new phrase, ",
      " printing up T-shirts and bumper stickers and holding Parents Matter rallies in suburban and exurban counties that supported Biden in 2020. McAuliffe\u2019s quote became the centerpiece of a rolling series of ads accusing him of going \u201con the attack against parents.\u201d A longtime critic of organized labor, Youngkin also sought to drive a wedge between teachers and their unions, promising to devote at least $100 million to raise teacher salaries while at the same time saying that McAuliffe would bow to his special-interest allies rather than doing what\u2019s best for children.",
      "A vast majority of Virginia\u2019s teachers belong to the N.E.A., which tends to cover more rural areas, not the A.F.T., whose members are generally concentrated in big cities. But Weingarten was friendly with McAuliffe from the Clinton days and was supporting his candidacy on Twitter and cable news, and the A.F.T. was helping him develop his education platform. Weingarten told me that she called McAuliffe after the debate to tell him that he was wrong \u2014 that parents should have a role in their children\u2019s education. \u201cTerry made a very bad mistake, which Youngkin capitalized on,\u201d she said. (Through a spokesman, McAuliffe said that he talked to Weingarten regularly during the campaign but has no recollection of her criticizing his remark.)",
      "By the fall of 2021, America\u2019s public schools were fully open, but mask mandates were still being hotly contested. Weingarten had been working to try to rebuild trust between some families and their schools. In late September, just a couple of days after the McAuliffe debate, she held a virtual town hall on mask mandates with Open Schools USA, an anti-masking right-wing parents\u2019 rights group that was rallying families to pull their children out of public schools, in an effort to foster open dialogue with the union\u2019s critics.",
      "Under Weingarten, who was elected president of the A.F.T. in 2008, the national union has gone all in on electoral politics, significantly increasing its political spending in the belief that the best way to serve its rank and file is by electing Democrats. The A.F.T. gave more than $1 million to McAuliffe, and Weingarten even knocked on doors for him in Alexandria. But Youngkin had the momentum in the final weeks of the race. His candidacy received another boost in October when Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the F.B.I. to help address the rising threats of violence toward some school-board members. The order stemmed from a letter written to the Biden administration by the National School Boards Association, asking that federal law enforcement address threats against public school officials that \u201ccould be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism.\u201d But Republican lawmakers and the right-wing media seized on the language in the letter to ",
      " \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d Youngkin quickly exploited the opportunity, releasing an ad claiming that the F.B.I. was trying to \u201csilence parents.\u201d",
      "On the night before the election, Weingarten headed down to Virginia to warm up the crowd at McAuliffe\u2019s closing rally in Fairfax County. She was eager to be on hand for the final push, and her staff asked for her to be given a speaking role at the rally. Because she had been such a generous and loyal supporter of McAuliffe\u2019s, the campaign didn\u2019t want to say no, even though some Democrats worried that they could be handing Youngkin another gift.",
      "Politically speaking, Weingarten played perfectly into Youngkin\u2019s Parents Matter campaign. That spring, a right-wing watchdog group, Americans for Public Trust, had gotten hold of email communications between top officials at the A.F.T. and the C.D.C. about the agency\u2019s school-reopening guidelines through the Freedom of Information Act and had passed them on to The New York Post. The tabloid, which had been gleefully attacking Weingarten for years \u2014 dubbing her Whine-garten \u2014 trumpeted the story: ",
      " The rest of the right-wing media and numerous Republican officials instantly jumped on the narrative. Senator Susan Collins of Maine grilled the C.D.C.\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, at a committee hearing over what she called the C.D.C.\u2019s \u201csecret negotiations\u201d with the teachers\u2019 union. Weingarten told me that the C.D.C. had solicited the A.F.T.\u2019s input and that the union hadn\u2019t suggested anything that the agency wasn\u2019t already considering incorporating into its guidelines. But the appearance of a partisan union leader who had privately discussed the future of the nation\u2019s schools with a government agency could be counterproductive in Virginia\u2019s charged political climate.",
      "Youngkin\u2019s staff was giddy at the prospect. \u201cI wanted to send them a gift basket,\u201d Kristin Davison, another senior Youngkin strategist, told me. \u201cIt was almost as good as when Stacey Abrams came.\u201d Republican elected officials around the country took potshots at their emerging villain. \u201cThe union boss responsible for shutting down schools is the final surrogate for Terry McAuliffe\u2019s failing campaign,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote on Twitter. \u201cVirginians should vote accordingly!\u201d",
      "Youngkin won narrowly, motivating the G.O.P. base and making critical inroads in Loudoun, which had voted overwhelmingly for Biden. \u201cFor a closer for a campaign, you would think you would bring in a showstopper,\u201d Betsy DeVos gloated on Fox News on election night. \u201cI guess, in this case, he did bring in a showstopper in Randi Weingarten, because she definitely stopped the show for kids across the country.\u201d",
      "may be too progressive, but to some members of her own union, she is not progressive enough. As the pandemic dragged on, she found herself caught between the wishes of the Democratic establishment she did not want to alienate and the left-leaning rank and file she represented. In Chicago, this tension came down, in early 2022, to the most elemental question for unions: whether or not to strike.",
      "At the time, the new Omicron variant was surging, and Illinois was experiencing a record number of Covid cases and hospitalizations. The A.F.T.\u2019s left-wing local, the Chicago Teachers Union, was concerned about sending its 25,000 members back to the classroom after winter break. The union was hearing similar worries from the Black families whose children make up a large percentage of the 320,000 students in Chicago\u2019s public schools. Many white suburban and exurban parents had been desperate to see their children return to the classroom and were now committed to keeping them there; but many urban Black parents \u2014 who tended to live in smaller homes with more family members, had generally lower vaccination rates and had lost more loved ones to the pandemic \u2014 had been and remained wary, especially with a new variant spiking.",
      "The union demanded mandatory testing for all teachers and students or a temporary return to remote learning. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, balked. President Biden and other prominent Democrats had been unambiguous about their desire for the ",
      " And the recent governor\u2019s election in Virginia had underscored the political danger of introducing more disruptions to in-person learning, especially with the 2022 midterms just around the corner. For Weingarten and the national union, a strike in the country\u2019s third-largest school system would obviously be politically costly.",
      "The insurgent group that leads the C.T.U. first came together in 2008, when the bipartisan education-reform movement was sweeping across the country, dividing the Democratic Party. Centrist billionaires and centrist Democrats joined forces to lead the effort to introduce more testing, accountability and free-market competition to the public schools. But the more progressive wing of the party viewed these measures as an attack on the very institution of public education, unleashing the forces of capitalism on what is supposed to be a public good.",
      "In Chicago, the reform efforts were led by Arne Duncan, the chief executive of the city\u2019s public-school district and President Obama\u2019s future education secretary. \u201cNeoliberal education reform hit Chicago like a ton of bricks,\u201d Jesse Sharkey, a high school history teacher, told me. Sharkey was a leader of this insurgency and would go on to become president of the C.T.U. from 2018 to 2022. \u201cYou\u2019d flip on the TV or pick up a newspaper, and you couldn\u2019t avoid hearing our so-called leaders trashing our schools, talking about their culture of failure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an environment that was downright hostile to public education.\u201d",
      "Sharkey and his fellow insurgents didn\u2019t believe the national union was fighting aggressively enough against these Democratic reformers. Tapping into Chicago\u2019s long history of community-based organizing, they built their own grass-roots movement within the union called the Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators, or CORE. Led by Karen Lewis, a chemistry teacher and union activist, CORE challenged the C.T.U.\u2019s incumbent leadership in 2010 and won control of the Chicago union. Two years later, after the city\u2019s new Democratic mayor, President Obama\u2019s former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, embarked on an ambitious program to close public schools and replace them with charters, the C.T.U. called ",
      " in 25 years. While the C.T.U. was voting on the strike authorization, Weingarten arrived in Chicago to appear on a panel with Emanuel at a conference hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative. It was a stunning turn of events that spoke to the tension between the A.F.T. and its left wing. For the political health of the union, Weingarten felt she needed to preserve her relationships with the country\u2019s most powerful Democratic leaders, many of whom, like Emanuel, were centrist reformers.",
      "As the 2012 strike wore on, Emanuel tried to turn the city against the teachers, accusing them of using ",
      " and unsuccessfully sought a court order to force them to return to work. After seven days, the city backed down; the union won major concessions, including a 16 percent raise over four years and the right for teachers who were laid off as part of Emanuel\u2019s ongoing school closures to be given priority for positions at other schools. The strike instantly became a galvanizing event for the union\u2019s more progressive members. Not only does CORE still control the C.T.U., but like-minded left-wing slates have since taken control of A.F.T. locals in several other cities, too, including Los Angeles and Baltimore.",
      "These insurgent caucuses are unified by what they call \u201csocial justice unionism.\u201d They see public schools\u2019 ongoing struggles to educate their students as inseparable from the larger societal and economic issues facing their working-class members and the poor communities whose children dominate their classrooms. \u201cWe are trying to promote a brand of unionism that goes all out in its fight for educational justice and is brave about taking on conflicts,\u201d Sharkey says. \u201cIn some ways, we\u2019re less careful about who we piss off nationally.\u201d",
      "There is a natural tension between these insurgent movements and the more establishment-oriented national union. In 2015, some rank-and-file members protested the A.F.T.\u2019s decision to issue an early endorsement of Hillary Clinton, to whom Weingarten is close, who was running against the pro-labor Bernie Sanders. But the tension is about more than just politics; it also goes to the heart of the A.F.T.\u2019s identity. To these caucuses, the union\u2019s power comes from the collective strength of its members \u2014 from the bottom up \u2014 which can conflict with the top-down leadership style of Weingarten, who has cultivated a distinct public profile, sometimes characterized by her own tendency toward political hyperbole. An impulsive user of Twitter, she has been known to send out the occasional overheated message. During the pandemic, when DeSantis supporters were selling \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci My Florida\u201d merchandise, including beer koozies, on the G.O.P.\u2019s WinRed website, she wrote: \u201cDisgusting. Millions of Floridians are going to ",
      "\u201d She later apologized for the tweet. ",
      "Two days after returning from winter break in January 2022, with their demands still unmet, the C.T.U. called a strike. \u201cThe union isn\u2019t stupid,\u201d Sharkey, who was president at the time, told me. \u201cWe knew people were sick of the pandemic.\u201d But, he went on, \u201cfor better or for worse we\u2019re a union that strikes. We didn\u2019t think it would be an easy or strategically wise thing, but there was a principle around it. It was something we had to do.\u201d",
      "The union already had a contentious relationship with Lightfoot, dating back to an 11-day strike over wages and class sizes in 2019 that ended with the city making major concessions. This time, though, the mayor had public opinion on her side, and she leveraged it in a flurry of media interviews, accusing the C.T.U. of holding Chicago\u2019s children \u201chostage.\u201d Lightfoot had long seen the A.F.T.\u2019s local as a \u201cpolitical movement\u201d whose ambitions extended well beyond protecting the rights of its workers. \u201cI think, ultimately, they\u2019d like to take over ",
      " but take over running the city government,\u201d she told The Times in 2021.",
      "The 2022 strike quickly became a political nightmare for national Democrats: A Democratic mayor was at war with a Democratic union, shutting down Chicago\u2019s schools at a moment when children were finally back in the classroom and the country was just beginning to confront the learning loss and emotional trauma caused by the pandemic. Splinter groups of teachers in Northern California were also planning sickouts in the face of the Omicron surge. The Chicago strike put Weingarten in a difficult position. Publicly, she supported the C.T.U., while also saying that children needed to be in the classroom. Behind the scenes, she was calling and texting Sharkey constantly, offering to do anything she could \u2014 even arrange a call with people at the White House \u2014 to help press Lightfoot and end the strike. After a few days, under intensifying public pressure, the C.T.U.\u2019s members voted to return to work. They had lost this battle, but they already had their sights on a bigger one: the city\u2019s upcoming mayoral election.",
      " before the 2022 midterms, the results from the first full National Assessment of Educational Progress since the start of the pandemic were released, revealing that 40 percent of the country\u2019s eighth-grade public-school students were not proficient in math, and 32 percent were not proficient in reading. The strikingly low scores instantly became a G.O.P. talking point: The culprit wasn\u2019t the pandemic, schools or teachers but the unions and Democratic politicians beholden to them. \u201cWe cannot let the nation forget how teachers\u2019 unions tried to hold our children\u2019s futures for ransom,\u201d said Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, then the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \u201cThese union bosses, and the politicians who enabled them, must be held accountable.\u201d Republicans up and down the ballot accused their Democratic opponents of carrying water for the teachers\u2019 unions. A week before the election, Fox News ran a segment headlined \u201cHave the Teachers Unions Sold Out Your Kids to the Democrats?\u201d",
      "Christopher Rufo, the right-wing activist who manufactured the obsession with C.R.T. two years earlier, was now on Fox News railing against another crisis \u2014 the ",
      " that he charged was being \u201cmainlined\u201d into America\u2019s public schools \u2014 while Republican candidates condemned the \u201cgrooming\u201d of children to identify as different genders in the nation\u2019s classrooms. Many Republican candidates pledged their allegiance to a \u201cParents\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u201d requiring schools to provide information on reading lists, curriculums and whether a family\u2019s child used another name or pronoun in school.",
      "The A.F.T. spent in excess of $20 million in the 2022 midterms, more than it ever had in an off-year election, and Weingarten campaigned tirelessly with high-profile Democrats around the country, her arrival on the stump invariably inspiring glee among local Republican leaders. When she appeared in Michigan with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, one G.O.P. pundit, Kaylee McGhee White, described her on Fox Business Network as \u201cthe kiss of death.\u201d Whitmer won easily, as did many other Democrats whose opponents had railed against drag-queen shows for children or L.G.B.T.Q.-themed books in school libraries. But Republican candidates who campaigned on another education issue \u2014 school choice \u2014 fared much better.",
      "As a political matter, all the education battles that had erupted since the start of the pandemic \u2014 over school closures, over how the country\u2019s racial history should be taught, over what sort of role parents ought to have in the classroom \u2014 were really about the same thing: whether America\u2019s children should continue to be educated in government-run public schools. Did the pandemic and the culture wars reveal the indispensability of these schools to their communities and to the broader fabric of the nation, or did they only underscore their inherent limitations \u2014 in effect, making the case for school choice?",
      "It was the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman who first proposed the modern concept of school vouchers in a paper in 1955. Friedman was a champion of free markets, and his idea was to leverage the transformative power of capitalism to prod schools to compete for families\u2019 dollars. But vouchers served another purpose too. The Supreme Court had just ruled on Brown v. Board of Education, and many white Americans were worried about the looming prospect of being forced to send their children to desegregated schools. ",
      ", writing, \u201cUnder such a system, there can develop exclusively white schools, exclusively colored schools and mixed schools.\u201d",
      "Thirty years later, with Friedman serving as an economic adviser, President Reagan tried repeatedly to introduce federal school-voucher legislation. One of his most vocal opponents was Al Shanker, then the A.F.T.\u2019s president, who argued that choice might be the point of \u201cshopping malls,\u201d but it was not the point of education, nor was it the reason taxpayers were expected to fund the nation\u2019s public schools: \u201cWe do so not to satisfy the individual wants of parents and students but because of the public interest in producing an educated citizenry capable of exercising the rights of liberty and being productive members of society.\u201d",
      "Even Congress, where Republicans held the Senate majority, considered Reagan\u2019s voucher proposals too radical. But the concept endured. In the 1990s, vouchers were championed by Christian conservatives like Paul Weyrich, a founder of the Heritage Foundation and mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas. Weyrich believed that the nation\u2019s public schools had become \u201cmorally decadent institutions\u201d and argued that the only answer was for Christians to educate their children themselves, ideally with government money. Over the years, some states experimented with limited voucher programs, typically designed to target discrete populations like children with special needs. But the pandemic created an opening for voucher advocates to think more ambitiously and move more aggressively. In fact, this had been the plan almost from the very beginning. Two months into the school closures, in the spring of 2020, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Catholic archbishop of New York, asked DeVos \u2014 then the education secretary and a longtime supporter of school choice \u2014 in an interview on SiriusXM radio if she intended to \u201cutilize this particular crisis to ensure that justice is finally done to our kids and the parents who choose to send them to faith-based schools.\u201d ",
      ": \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d",
      "In 2021, at least 18 states created new school-choice programs or expanded existing ones, and more followed suit in 2022. Some of these new programs represent a significant departure from those of the past. Known collectively as universal voucher programs, they are available to everyone and can be applied toward any kind of school. The goal is not merely to disrupt public education but to defund and dismantle it. For years, the country\u2019s lower courts largely agreed that spending taxpayer money on religious schools was unconstitutional. But last summer, the Supreme Court created a new precedent, ruling that it was in fact ",
      " \u2014 in this case, one in rural Maine \u2014 to ",
      " religious schools.",
      "DeVos, now back in the private sector, is one of the leading funders of this new national voucher campaign, primarily through an organization that she helped found called the American Federation for Children. The group and its affiliates spent $9 million on school-choice campaigns in 2022, at least $2.5 million of which came directly from DeVos and her husband. They spent much of this money in the primaries, turning support for school choice into a litmus test and targeting Republican incumbents opposed to it. Three-quarters of the candidates they supported won. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a red wave or a blue wave in the midterms, but there was a school-choice wave,\u201d Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at the American Federation for Children, wrote to me in an email. Echoing Weyrich\u2019s sentiments about the moral decadence of American public education, DeAngelis quoted Voddie Baucham, a Christian home-schooling advocate: \u201cWe cannot continue to send our children to Caesar for their education and be surprised when they come home as Romans.\u201d",
      "DeAngelis identified Weingarten as a useful political foil long before Mike Pompeo. He has been trolling her relentlessly on Twitter since 2021, ostentatiously thanking her for starting \u201cthe school choice revolution.\u201d In March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, he posed with a life-size cardboard cutout of her clutching an award labeled \u201cThreat to America\u2019s Children,\u201d his left thumb raised in approval.",
      " of Chicago, was right about the local teachers\u2019 union\u2019s political ambitions. In February, Brandon Johnson, a former middle-school teacher and paid union organizer, challenged her in the city\u2019s mayoral election. It was a long shot \u2014 one early poll put his support at 3 percent \u2014 but for the C.T.U., the Johnson campaign was a natural progression. To pursue their broader agenda, which reaches beyond education into areas like housing and policing, they needed the kind of power that can come only from winning partisan political elections. And they had both a powerful grass-roots movement and a source of campaign funds, in the form of members\u2019 dues, that could be leveraged to support Johnson\u2019s candidacy.",
      "Johnson\u2019s campaign was underwritten largely by the teachers\u2019 unions. Though the A.F.T. and the C.T.U. had their differences in the past, they have become more closely aligned in recent years. While there are still some divisions within the Democratic Party over education policy, the bipartisan education-reform movement that once posed such a formidable existential threat to the A.F.T. is a shadow of its former self. The threat to the A.F.T. is now partisan, which means that Weingarten is no longer facing as much pressure from centrist Democrats. Backed by the financial and organizational muscle of the national and local teachers\u2019 unions, Johnson knocked Lightfoot out of the two-person runoff, making her the first incumbent mayor in Chicago to be unseated after a single term in 40 years.",
      "By now, Pompeo, Tim Scott, Marco Rubio, Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump and the rest of the Republican Party were busy elevating education to a central plank in its 2024 platform and in the process transforming Weingarten into the new Hillary \u2014 a G.O.P. stand-in for everything that was wrong with America. The Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic was continuing to build its case that Weingarten and the A.F.T. exerted undue influence over the C.D.C.\u2019s school-reopening guidelines, summoning ",

      " Calling out by name some of the people who had demonized her since the pandemic, including Betsy DeVos, she described the ongoing effort to defund public schools as nothing less than a threat to \u201ccornerstones of community, of our democracy, our economy and our nation.\u201d She pointed to studies that have shown that vouchers don\u2019t improve student achievement, characterizing them as a back door into private and parochial schools that are not subject to the same federal civil rights laws as public institutions and can therefore promote discrimination. \u201cOur public schools shouldn\u2019t be pawns for politicians\u2019 ambitions!\u201d she thundered, moving toward her emotional conclusion. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be defunded or destroyed by ideologues.\u201d",
      "Like the Virginia\u2019s governor\u2019s race one and a half years earlier, Chicago\u2019s mayoral runoff became, at least in part, a referendum on education. The effects of the pandemic on Chicago\u2019s public schools have been profound. More than 33,000 ",

Chicago has no Republican Party to speak of, but Vallas, a vocal proponent of charter schools and vouchers, was the conservative candidate. In 2009, he said he was \u201cmore of a Republican than a Democrat.\u201d He was supported by the local business community and endorsed by the city\u2019s police union. A group affiliated with the American Federation for Children spent $60,285 on a pro-Vallas digital media effort. But Arne Duncan and a number of other centrist Democrats endorsed Vallas, too.",
      "On the eve of the April runoff election, Weingarten headed to Chicago to speak at a Johnson political rally headlined by Bernie Sanders. Both the A.F.T. and the C.T.U. continued to funnel money into Johnson\u2019s campaign as the election approached, their combined contributions totaling $4.6 million. \u201cAll of this stuff is about power,\u201d observed a local community activist, Ja\u2019Mal Green, who had run in the first round of the election but didn\u2019t make the runoff and was now supporting Vallas.",
      "When Johnson narrowly won, it was a stunning upset, not just for the candidate but for the left. Even as the Republicans were ramping up their attacks on Weingarten and on the institution of public education, the teachers\u2019 unions had effectively elected the mayor of America\u2019s third-largest city, who was himself an avowedly progressive union organizer promising to raise taxes on the rich, reform the police and increase funding for the city\u2019s schools. Maybe Pompeo hadn\u2019t been wrong, at least as far as his own party was concerned. It was those who had underestimated the political power of the unions who were mistaken. \u201cThey said this would never happen,\u201d ",

Standing at the wall, she had a detailed exchange with a Border Patrol official for the benefit of the visitors about how Mexican drug cartels managed to ferry fentanyl into Arizona and beyond. At a round-table discussion in the Cochise County sheriff\u2019s office, she moderated a brisk dialogue between her congressional colleagues and beleaguered local officials whose once-quiet communities were now plagued by cartel associates. When the four Republicans responded with harsh criticisms of the Biden administration, Sinema nodded sympathetically, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Sinema \u2014 who four months earlier left the Democratic Party and declared herself an independent \u2014 had orchestrated this April visit for two reasons, one explicit and the other hinted at. The four men joining her at the border had been \u201ccarefully curated\u201d by Sinema, she told me the day before. Tillis had partnered with her on important legislation in the past, and they were now collaborating on what they hoped would be the first major border-and-immigration-reform bill to become law in a generation. Sinema targeted Ciscomani, Gonzales and Valadao, all of whom served on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, as potential recruits for this effort.",
      "Like two other recent legislative accomplishments that Sinema had a major hand in crafting \u2014 the 2021 infrastructure bill and the 2022 gun-safety initiative \u2014 the Sinema-Tillis plan is decidedly half a loaf, for which Sinema offers no apologies. \u201cThe people who want no bread if they can\u2019t get the entire loaf of bread,\u201d she told me, \u201care people who\u2019ve never been hungry.\u201d",
      "But even if less than a full meal, the plan would still be consequential \u2014 increasing funds and equipment for the Border Patrol, reforming the asylum process, addressing backlogs of employment-based visas and providing a path to citizenship for about two million young American residents (the so-called Dreamers) \u2014 and its passage would be an even more improbable achievement than finding common ground on guns last year. \u201cGuns is a high-wire act,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who worked with Sinema on the 2022 law and is now doing the same on immigration, told me. \u201cImmigration is a high-wire act while holding active sticks of dynamite.\u201d",
      "Unlike those earlier legislative tightrope walks, Sinema, who is known for avoiding the news media, was performing this one in public, accompanied by a half-dozen members of the Arizona press as well as myself. It was clear, if unstated, that this was the second reason for going to the border, which most Democrats have assiduously stayed away from amid growing Republican criticism: her 2024 re-election bid. She never once raised the subject during our four interviews over two months. When I did, a day before the border visit, she cheerfully replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question. But I\u2019m glad you started with it. Got it right out of the way!\u201d",
      "\u201cCan you answer at least when you believe you\u2019ll have to make up your mind?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIf you do ",
      " run, or if you run and are defeated, do you have a plan for what you would do next?\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, not really thinking about that.\u201d",
      " had been apparent for months. Why else would she have left the Democratic Party four years into her term, if not to avoid a primary in which the party\u2019s progressive base was guaranteed to turn its wrath on her? Why else was she (as ",
      ") furtively holding staff retreats to lay out a timetable for commissioning polls and opposition research? Nothing she said in our conversations left me with the impression that she was putting a few final touches on her senatorial legacy on her way out the door to the private sector. At the same time, Sinema \u2014 whom even her closest friends describe as calculated, and who described herself to me as \u201cvery intentional\u201d and \u201ca planner\u201d \u2014 almost never telegraphs her strategy. It suited her ends to freeze the 2024 machinations by leaving everyone guessing.",
      "Still, here she was, flanked by Republican legislators and border officials, blanketing the state\u2019s airwaves 19 months before what is sure to be the most complicated race of her two decades in electoral politics. It will also be, aside from the presidential election itself, the most significant contest next year, and it may well decide which party controls the Senate. Over the past two years, the Democrats (with independents) have held the majority by no more than two votes, which has allowed Sinema and another centrist Democrat, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, to command extraordinary influence over the party\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "If Arizona progressives have their way, Sinema will be ousted for repeated apostasies, from protecting the filibuster \u2014 the means by which, according to traditional Senate rules, a minority can block a vote that a frustrated majority would otherwise be able to move forward \u2014 to siding with private-equity donors. If Sinema has hers, Arizona voters across the political spectrum will reward her displays of discerning bipartisanship in an age of mindless party loyalty. It could also be the case that Sinema and her likely Democratic rival, Representative Ruben Gallego, will do sufficient damage to each other to ensure that the winner is a Republican, perhaps losing the Senate majority in the process.",
      "But additional implications come into play should Sinema prevail as an independent. \u201cThese are very different times,\u201d Tillis told me, \u201cand from the polls I\u2019ve seen, an increasing number of voters are saying, \u2018I\u2019m not buying what the far left and far right are selling.\u2019 Now, whether that sentiment transfers to an electoral map is still unclear. But if voters really are saying, \u2018Give me a viable alternative,\u2019 then Sinema has a pretty solid argument to make.\u201d",
      "Her test case, if it succeeds, could in turn rattle the foundation of a two-party system that has held sway in America for a century. It\u2019s still a big \u201cif.\u201d A survey conducted in January by the Democratic pollster Jill Normington shows ",
      " With no affiliated party to support her \u2014 with two parties, rather than just one, actively working to defeat her \u2014 the incumbent is gambling that she can attract donors and elected surrogates who are willing to risk angering others in their partisan tribe by supporting her. Since announcing his candidacy in late January, Gallego has outraised Sinema, $3.7 million to $2.1 million, but she has almost four times as much money in the bank as he does.",
      "Most of all, she is betting that her lawmaking acumen will attract a new coalition of Arizona voters. No one unaffiliated with either of the two parties has ever won statewide office there. For Sinema to do so, according to Chuck Coughlin, a prominent Republican consultant in Arizona, \u201cshe needs 20 to 25 percent of Democratic voters, 25 to 30 percent of Republicans and 50 to 60 percent of self-identified independents.\u201d",
      "In Coughlin\u2019s view, Sinema\u2019s easiest task will be to win over a majority of ",
      " according to data from the secretary of state\u2019s office. A taller order will be to pick off at least one-quarter of the 34.5 percent of Arizonans who are registered Republicans. Accomplishing this would require her to outperform President ",
      " against Donald Trump in 2020, as well as Gov. Katie Hobbs, who received almost 11 percent of the Republican vote in her 2022 victory over the far-right Kari Lake.",
      "Of course, those candidates also benefited from their party\u2019s overwhelming support. Sinema, even before she left the party in December, had become the Democrat whom Democrats love to hate. After casting the deciding vote against a minimum-wage increase in March 2021 \u2014 and doing so theatrically, with a curtsy and a thumbs down \u2014 the progressive publication ",
      " (Sinema says she voted as she did because the minimum-wage provision did not belong in a reconciliation bill, which must be budgetary in nature to qualify for passage by a simple majority. A spokeswoman also says that she curtsied out of gratitude for the Senate clerk\u2019s late-hour labors and that she was not the only senator that night who signified \u201cno\u201d using the thumbs-down gesture.)",
      "In January 2022, after her refusal to pass voting rights legislation by discarding the Senate filibuster that stood in the way, ",
      " \u201cThe decision was really a no-brainer,\u201d a former state party official told me, adding that the censure resolution was supported by more than 90 percent of Arizona\u2019s Democratic precinct committee members. In a foreshadowing of her formal break from the party, Sinema endorsed but did not campaign for any of her fellow Arizona Democrats during the 2022 midterms, including two longtime friends, Katie Hobbs and the attorney general candidate Kris Mayes, both of whom won, but barely. Mayes in particular needed all the help she could get, prevailing by a mere 280 votes. Hobbs, on the other hand, relied heavily on the turnout of a progressive base that might have reacted poorly to Sinema\u2019s presence on the stump. To campaign for one and not the other would have underscored just how problematic Sinema had become for her fellow Democrats.",
      "All that said, by Coughlin\u2019s calculation, Sinema will still have to garner the support of 20 to 25 percent of Arizona\u2019s Democrats who are somehow unbothered by the spectacle of their former Democratic senator now chumming it up with Republicans while disparaging the Biden administration. The notion that wooing Democrats is likely to be Sinema\u2019s most difficult task constitutes a striking reversal in the political career of a prominent Arizona progressive whose election to the Senate in 2018 was celebrated by the party as a historic breakthrough.",
      "Since that high moment, their shared history has been like a marriage of convenience in which they shamelessly used the other until, perhaps inevitably, they came to have only distrust in common. By ending the charade, Sinema is gambling that she can manage the fallout and ultimately be rewarded for her declaration of independence. Whether that happens \u2014 whether she succeeds in making her case as America\u2019s indispensable consensus builder in the Senate \u2014 depends in no small measure on whether the party Sinema left behind can remember more than just the bad times.",
      " Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, asked Sinema \u2014 with whom he is friendly \u2014 to drop by the Library of Congress and have tea with about 40 teenage girls from his state who had been named \u201cMardi Gras princesses.\u201d She did so, taking a group photo with the princesses, all of whom were wearing crowns. One girl asked the 46-year-old senator for some tips on how to handle the negativity that came her way.",
      "\u201cTake the time to be OK with yourself,\u201d Sinema answered. \u201cIf someone says something bad about you, it falls in a place that\u2019s soft. But if you\u2019re OK with yourself, you know that what they\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t matter, and it doesn\u2019t land so hard.\u201d",
      "At times, Sinema employs the empathic language of the social worker she was straight out of college. Even in those moments, however, she is never one to mince words, or to linger. Sinema observes no religious faith, but she is worshipful of efficiency. She obtained advanced degrees \u2014 a J.D., a Ph.D. in justice studies and an M.B.A. \u2014 the same years, respectively, in which she won seats to the State House (2004), the U.S. House (2012) and the U.S. Senate (2018).

      "During our second meeting, at a coffee shop in Southeast Washington in March, she was running five minutes behind. Her scheduler, she explained, had earlier calculated one of the day\u2019s drives as 10 minutes when it was in fact 15.",
      "\u201cSo, to a regular person, this probably sounds insane,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cBut I need those five minutes. I have something planned for those five minutes. I don\u2019t waste five minutes. I know that is unusual. That is how I\u2019ve always been.\u201d",
      "The two young aides who accompanied her were scowling wordlessly at their smartphones nearby. The scheduling misstep, Sinema said, had been handled. \u201cI don\u2019t waste emotions,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t have guilt or regret, because those are useless emotions.\u201d When I suggested that guilt could be a constructive force for change, Sinema corrected me. Remorse could be constructive, she said. Guilt could not: \u201cIt\u2019s a useless emotion that hurts you, and nothing else.\u201d",
      "Sinema is not one for niceties, and whatever frailties she possesses are glimpsed by only a few friends, like the former Democratic congresswomen Kathleen Rice and Stephanie Murphy, who refer to her as Sin. She does not like to talk about her Mormon family, with whom she apparently seldom communicates other than her stepbrother, Paul Sheldon, a Tucson police officer who appeared in a ",

Desai, a prominent election-law attorney who represented Arizona\u2019s secretary of state in 2020 election cases, once served as campaign counsel to Sinema, who had recommended her to Biden\u2019s team. Sinema ran to catch Romney after his vote. She asked him to reconsider, adding that Desai was a personal friend. Romney told me: \u201cShe responded to my concerns and convinced me to go back and change my vote. And I wouldn\u2019t do that for just anybody.\u201d Desai would ultimately be confirmed by a vote of 67 to 29, with more bipartisan support than any federal judicial nominee had received in over 20 years.",
      "Sinema told me that Biden\u2019s chief of staff at the time, Ron Klain, had expressed doubts that she could find any Republican support for Desai. It was this lack of faith in Sinema\u2019s abilities that compelled her to later \u2014 at a fund-raiser filled with ",
      " \u2014 invoke Klain\u2019s name while extending her middle finger. (Klain did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)",
      "Though it has frequently been reported that the independent senator would \u201ccontinue to caucus with the Democrats,\u201d Sinema told me this was misleading: She almost never showed up to Democratic meetings to begin with, as they tended to be profligate time wasters. Nor does she adhere to the Beltway ritual of appearing on the Sunday talk shows. In her view, they produce only \u201cnoise,\u201d though it\u2019s also the case that Sinema\u2019s sometimes cutting utterances do not come off well in such staid settings. Her aversion to publicly revealing her hand differentiates Sinema from Manchin, a voluble regular on the Sunday shows.",
      "Some have inferred from her reticence that Sinema either is incapable of defending her positions or has no actual positions to defend \u2014 that she arrives at her decisions capriciously and only after drawing maximum attention to herself. To her friends, like Murphy, the former congresswoman, this view bears more than a whiff of sexism and misses the point: \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s playing the inside game, rather than the media game, demonstrates that she\u2019s a professional who shows respect for people, even the ones who\u2019ve disrespected her. If you\u2019re a real legislator and you want to get stuff done, you have to build trust. The minute you call the press or sic the activists on someone to try and apply pressure, you\u2019ve lost that person\u2019s trust.\u201d",
      "I asked Sinema if she found it surprising that someone of her unorthodox character would come to be regarded as a kind of throwback to a less-partisan era, even as a Senate institutionalist. \u201cI think what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she evenly replied, \u201cis you\u2019re mistaking someone who\u2019s not interested in marching to someone else\u2019s drum or following their rules, which are petty and dumb, as being somehow incompatible with wanting to preserve and protect the fundamentals of our democracy.\u201d",
      " Kyrsten Sinema \u2014 14 years old at the time but considerably younger in appearance \u2014 stood before the school board in DeFuniak Springs, Fla., accompanied by her high school guidance counselor, Cynthia Jeselnik. The girl explained that she had already taken every required and honors class her school had to offer. Now she wished to take courses at Okaloosa-Walton Community College (now Northwest Florida State College), 31 miles away in Niceville. Her goal, as Jeselnik would recall to me, \u201cwas to graduate early, so that she could get on with her life and with the course she had laid out for herself.\u201d",
      "The young honors student did not have to state the obvious, which was that she saw no future for herself in a rural community with a poverty rate that was close to 25 percent. Nor did she share the particulars of her personal life, with either her counselor or the board: how she had been born into a comfortable middle-class family in Tucson, Ariz., and had nurtured ambitions since she was 6, when she proclaimed to her first-grade teacher that she intended one day to be a U.S. senator and an author; how her world caved in when her father, an attorney, was suspended indefinitely for \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, deceit and misrepresentation\u201d in 1983; how the family\u2019s car was subsequently repossessed and her mother, a devout Mormon, left the marriage and became involved with a teacher in the girl\u2019s elementary school; how she, her two siblings, her mother and her new stepfather abruptly left Arizona, driving cross-country to his family\u2019s community in DeFuniak Springs; how the family, with the stepfather struggling to find work, lived for nearly three years in a former gas station, while she and her siblings wore hand-me-down clothes provided by the local Mormon church and ate meals provided by the church and federal food assistance. ",
      "What she did say, when the board members advised her simply to find some way to busy herself at her high school, was: \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste a year doing this. Why are you holding me back?\u201d",
      "The school board acquiesced, and the girl, now 15, then drove her parents\u2019 car without a license to take night classes in Niceville. A year later, Sinema was ready to graduate as Walton High School\u2019s co-valedictorian. When she learned that only a member of the senior class could qualify for that top distinction, she and Jeselnik again petitioned school officials. \u201cThese are dumb rules,\u201d Sinema informed them, a preview of how she would later view Beltway mores.",
      "\u201cShe ended up getting a couple of school-district policies changed,\u201d her former counselor recalled. But other things the 16-year-old girl could not alter. Sinema had both the grades and the desire to apply to Harvard. Her parents, however, would not agree to this. Instead, she went to Brigham Young University, the Mormon institution in Provo, Utah, and her family moved to Utah with her. When she graduated from B.Y.U. just before her 19th birthday, she headed back to Arizona, leaving Utah, the Mormon Church and her family behind for good.",
      "The tightly knit community of Phoenix progressives saw in Sinema a fellow idealist, perhaps not fully appreciating at the time how the emotional scar tissue from her earlier years had hardened her into a survivor. She spent her first years in the city as a social worker, learning Spanish as she handled rough cases involving domestic abuse and shootings in the north-side barrios. Frustrated by her inability to improve the lives of immigrants and low-income families in a more sweeping way, she was urged by a local environmental activist named Sandy Bahr to go to law school or seek elective office. \u201cI suggested those two things,\u201d Bahr recalled, \u201cand she decided to do both at the same time.\u201d",
      "Sinema\u2019s early years as an outspoken liberal voice in Arizona politics would later be used against her \u2014 first by Republicans who mocked her Green Party ties and the ",
      " then by progressives who called her a sellout. At a rally she helped organize in 2002 to protest the Patriot Act, Sinema insisted that anyone bringing a firearm be turned away, explaining later, \u201cWe believe in world disarmament.\u201d That same year, she ran for the State House for the first time, without a party affiliation, declaring that among her chief priorities was \u201cstatewide responsible growth aimed at stopping sprawl.\u201d She finished last among the five candidates.",
      "By 2009, when she published a book titled \u201cUnite and Conquer,\u201d Sinema had settled on a tidy autobiographical summation that she promotes to this day \u2014 that of a lonely \u201cbomb thrower\u201d in the State Legislature who saw the light after a few months of misery and then became a happy consensus builder who \u201cgets stuff done.\u201d As with most political narratives, her distillation is more than a little reductive. Sinema did in fact get stuff done \u2014 notably leading the defeat of a ban on same-sex marriage \u2014 by reaching across the aisle. She did in fact, to the horror of her liberal friends, develop warm relations with Arizona conservatives like State Senator Russell Pearce, the author of the notoriously anti-immigration law known as S.B. 1070 (which allowed Arizona officers to arbitrarily demand a citizen\u2019s immigration papers), and Andy Biggs, the future chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.",
      "But she remained an unambiguous progressive well after she abandoned her bomb-throwing ways. In 2006, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators nationwide marched to protest a House Republican bill aiming to crack down on illegal immigration; a photograph of State Representative Sinema locking arms with Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva and other Arizona Democrats hung in her office for years afterward.",
      "\u201cI see interviews of A.O.C., and I\u2019m always struck by how much she was like Kyrsten in those days,\u201d recalled David Lujan, the Arizona Democrats\u2019 minority leader during Sinema\u2019s tenure, referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat. \u201cShe was ",
      " beloved progressive.\u201d At the same time, Lujan went on, \u201cshe studied polls more than anybody I knew.\u201d",
      " then a New York congressman and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, received a phone call from an Arizona state senator. Israel knew nothing about Kyrsten Sinema, apart from the fact that she was considering running for a seat representing the newly created Ninth Congressional District. Come to Phoenix, she told him, and I\u2019ll give you a rundown of all the likely Democratic candidates. (Sinema says she did not call to suggest the meeting; Israel maintains that she did.)",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s my point,\u201d she said with a smile.",
      "Caught off-guard, Israel muttered, \u201cWe could\u2019ve done this by phone.\u201d",
      "Holding his gaze, she replied: \u201cI wanted to be in the same room with you. I wanted you to see who I am.\u201d",
      "Impressed but still skeptical, Israel did not put his thumb on the scale for Sinema, who went on to thrash her Democratic opponents in the 2012 primary anyway. After eking out a victory over a Republican Tea Party candidate in November, she was ",

She organized dinner parties at her apartment and taught spinning classes in the House gym. Her flamboyant wardrobe stood out in a city where, she said in a speech to an L.G.B.T.Q. group back home, \u201cthey think that navy is like a fashion-forward choice.\u201d",
      "Having won a hotly contested district, Sinema was immediately designated a \u201cfront line\u201d member by the D.C.C.C. whose seat was at risk for the 2014 cycle. Sinema joined the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate Democrats. She made good on her campaign pledge to vote against Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader. During votes on the House floor, the freshman could be seen staring up at the tally board, openly agonizing, often casting her ballot just as time elapsed. A colleague recalled Sinema\u2019s wrestling with whether to leave the Ninth District and move to a safer one. A former aide remembered that she met with Israel to discuss the matter. He advised her that if she had any future interest in being a senator in a red state like Arizona, staying in a moderate district would improve her prospects. Sinema stayed.",
      "She handily won a second House term, then a third in 2016. Her acumen had become evident to senior members like the minority whip Steny H. Hoyer, who made Sinema his assistant whip in 2014, and her Republican colleague on the Financial Services Committee, Patrick T. McHenry, who told me, \u201cI viewed her as a student of power politics and how to be a meaningful player in the House.\u201d It did not escape McHenry\u2019s notice that Sinema acquired friendships on his side of the aisle \u2014 not just heavy hitters like Kevin McCarthy, the eventual House speaker, but also staunch ideologues like Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma. As the Republicans\u2019 chief deputy whip, McHenry found that whenever he needed Democratic votes, the Democratic assistant whip would be candid about what she could or could not deliver. Sinema, meanwhile, encouraged new moderate members to vote against the party line if it suited them politically \u2014 saying of Pelosi and Hoyer: \u201cThey\u2019ll be mad at you, but they\u2019ll get over it. Vote your district \u2014 it doesn\u2019t help anyone if you lose.\u201d",
      "In September 2017, Sinema declared her candidacy for the Senate against Jeff Flake, the Republican incumbent whose criticisms of President Donald Trump had caused his approval rating to tank back home. Democratic leaders immediately threw their support behind the three-term congresswoman, recognizing that no one else in their party had a shot in a state that had not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1988.",
      "Three weeks after Sinema declared, Flake announced that he would not be seeking another term. While the Republican front-runner, Martha McSally, fought off a primary challenge by wedding herself to Trump, Sinema angled for Arizona\u2019s growing suburban electorate. For the Republican chair of her campaign, she brought on Max Fose, a consultant who had worked with the state\u2019s legendary ",

Two days after her victory, the state\u2019s first female senator-elect returned to Washington to participate in the Democratic caucus\u2019s leadership vote. Though she had pledged not to vote for Senator Chuck Schumer as minority leader, when no challenger emerged, she joined her new colleagues to reinstall him in the role. Explaining her reversal, Sinema said in a statement, \u201cArizonans know I will work with anyone \u2014 in either party \u2014 to get things done for our state.\u201d",
      " she got to the Senate,\u201d Chris Murphy told me, \u201cI could see her during votes spending at least as much time on the Republican side, if not more, chatting them up. At first, I didn\u2019t know what she was doing over there. But then I figured it out. It was coldblooded. She was clearly setting herself up as someone who could bring the two sides together.\u201d",
      "Sinema first introduced herself to Senator Rob Portman, a conservative Republican from Ohio, and his wife back in 2015, while they and others were accompanying John Lewis at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., to commemorate the heroism of Lewis and other civil rights marchers who were brutally beaten by police officers a half-century earlier. \u201cKyrsten is not someone who is difficult to get to know,\u201d Portman told me. Like Sinema, Portman, whose son is gay, was a supporter of same-sex marriage.",
      "It turned out that the two senators had something else in common, which became evident in early 2021, when Sinema began to hold meetings to discuss bipartisan infrastructure legislation. Though several of her colleagues agreed on the worthiness of the endeavor, it was Portman who stayed behind at the first meeting and began working on a spreadsheet.",
      "The new legislative partners began with three baselines. One was Biden\u2019s stated preference that a federal investment in infrastructure be at least $600 billion in new spending. The second was that the bill be limited to only core infrastructure projects, including broadband. The third was Portman\u2019s insistence that the money not come from raising taxes \u2014 a red line that was also to Sinema\u2019s liking, but it was more effective to be able to tell her Democratic colleagues that a tax hike would be a nonstarter among Republicans.",
      "For two months, Sinema and Porter pored over infrastructure frameworks that various Senate committees had previously drawn up. The working group then expanded from two senators to 10, then to 20. They met in various hideaways and Capitol conference rooms. \u201cShe set deadlines, and she asked for deliverables on certain dates,\u201d said Romney, a key participant in the discussions. \u201cI won\u2019t mention names, but there were a few folks in our group, a couple in particular, who were inclined to spin out with various stories and experiences they\u2019d had in the past that they thought were relevant. And she would cut them off, even though they were far senior to her. She would say: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get back to the topic at hand. We need to get this resolved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Romney went on: \u201cAnd there were several times where we faced what we thought were dispositive roadblocks. A lot of us were inclined to say, \u2018OK, we just can\u2019t get there.\u2019\u201d At such moments, members often stormed out. But, Romney told me, \u201cshe would go get them and bring them back. She\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve got to get there. We don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Sinema-Portman infrastructure bill passed the Senate that August on an impressively bipartisan 69-to-30 vote. But its progress in the House was complicated by the multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better social-spending bill championed by Democratic progressives who threatened to hold the infrastructure bill hostage until Sinema and Manchin agreed to pass the bills in tandem. Neither of them would do so. Manchin\u2019s public explanation was that Build Back Better\u2019s cost was too high amid rising inflation, geopolitical instability and the pandemic. Sinema gave no public explanation at all. But she had already privately informed both Schumer and the Biden White House that the highest price tag she would agree to was $1.1 trillion \u2014 and that, as a friend of hers would say, \u201cshe wanted to be able to tell Arizonans that she didn\u2019t raise their taxes.\u201d",
      "In September 2021, Sinema attended a meeting of House and Senate Democrats at the White House to discuss what Biden hoped would be a $2 trillion version of Build Back Better. According to two of the attendees, Biden first asked each of the senators to articulate their concerns. When it was her turn, Sinema demurred, saying she wanted to hear what the House members had to say first.",
      "\u201cWell, if you\u2019re still at $1 trillion,\u201d Biden interjected, \u201cthen you might as well get up and leave.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. President,\u201d Sinema said, standing up, \u201cthat was a private conversation. If you want me to leave, I will.\u201d",
      "Then, seeming to recognize that losing Sinema\u2019s support would ensure defeat, Biden backed down, saying, \u201cPlease sit down.\u201d",
      "Sinema did so. Toward the end of the meeting, she said to the president: \u201cI told you that in confidence. And if that ends up in the press, I\u2019ll know it was someone from this room.\u201d (The White House did not respond to requests for comment.)",
      "The meeting concluded without further rancor. But the president did not direct House Democrats to let the bills be voted on separately. Sinema suspected that the White House was hoping she would relent. \u201cI would never in my life crack under pressure,\u201d Sinema told me. \u201cWhy would they think I\u2019m going to do it?\u201d",
      "She got her way in the end. On Nov. 5, 2021, the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in the House. Ten days later, Biden signed it into law. Sinema, meanwhile, continued to draw the ire of Democrats for opposing Build Back Better. In a rare interview with CNN, she refused to specify what it would take to change her mind, saying only, \u201cI won\u2019t support any legislation that increases burdens on Arizona or American businesses and reduces our ability to compete either globally or domestically.\u201d The legislation lay dormant into the following year.",
      "On May 24, 2022, a teenager armed with an AR-15-style rifle walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and massacred two teachers and 19 children. Sinema responded to the ",
      " which was widely denounced as proof that she had no intention of responding with concrete action. A day later, Chris Murphy \u2014 who, after the shocking Sandy Hook school shooting a decade earlier in his state, emerged as the Democrats\u2019 foremost advocate for gun reform \u2014 happened to read that Sinema had paused at an elevator in the Capitol to inform members of the news media that she would like to work with Republicans on the gun issue. The news initially struck Murphy as improbable: Sinema had effectively stopped talking to the Washington press.",
      "Murphy texted her: \u201cAre you serious?\u201d",
      "Sinema responded that she was. Within two hours, Murphy was sitting in her hideaway office in the basement of the Capitol. Later that day, Sinema walked onto the Senate floor and located the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cWho should I work with on guns?\u201d she asked him.",
      "She and McConnell had been friendly for some time, and she met frequently with him during the infrastructure deliberations. Later in 2022, she would go to his state, Kentucky, to speak at the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center, where she was praised by the minority leader as \u201cthe most effective first-term senator I\u2019ve seen in my time in the Senate.\u201d Now, responding to her question on the Senate floor, McConnell replied, \u201cJohn Cornyn and Thom Tillis.\u201d Sinema promptly texted them both. The next day, the two Republican senators and Sinema and Murphy were in her hideaway, devising a legislative framework. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a day when the four of us weren\u2019t talking multiple times,\u201d Tillis told me.",
      "That June, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Against the wishes of the powerful National Rifle Association, an astonishing 14 Senate Republicans voted for the bill, including the minority leader; as Murphy would tell me, \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t pass it without McConnell\u2019s support, and Kyrsten was in ongoing conversations with him.\u201d The bill did not address military-style rifles like the ones used by the Uvalde shooter or extend background checks to internet and gun-show sales, measures that were guaranteed to be blocked by a Republican filibuster. It did, however, provide enhanced penalties for straw purchases, add extra steps to background checks for purchasers who are 18 to 21 and close the so-called boyfriend loophole, which allowed abusive partners to own a gun even with an order of protection against them.",
      "\u201cSenator Sinema stepped up and played a critical role in passing what happened to be the most substantive and lifesaving gun legislation in a generation,\u201d Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, the nation\u2019s most influential gun-control group, told me. Still, though Watts, Murphy and other gun-safety advocates continue to press for a ban on military-style rifles, Sinema told me that she was unlikely to take up the cause. \u201cThe reason is pretty simple,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic. I don\u2019t spend my time in the world of fantasy. I spend my time in the world of the possible.\u201d",
      "Two months after the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was enacted, the path to the possible was found once again: Sinema and the Biden administration had reached a deal on the social-spending bill formerly known as Build Back Better. Now rechristened the Inflation Reduction Act, the initiative would spend roughly $500 billion to fund clean-energy programs and extend the Affordable Care Act. The accord with Sinema broke the deadlock, allowing for swift passage \u2014 and a win for the Biden White House.",
      "Still, progressives were not of the mind to applaud the Arizona senator, who had extracted a significant price in exchange for her support: The bill would no longer be paid for in part by closing the carried-interest loophole, which allowed wealthy private-equity executives to claim much of their compensation as investment gains rather than as taxable income. As reporters were quick to note, Sinema had received over $2 million in campaign donations from the investment sector over the previous decade. (And hundreds of thousands ",
      " was passed.)",
      "Sinema\u2019s rationale for supporting private-equity firms is rooted in the economic growth of Arizona, which, she claims, depends on affordable-housing construction that is underwritten by such firms. \u201cSo to me, it makes no sense to disincentivize the supply side of creating that affordable housing in multifamily units,\u201d Sinema told me.",
      "Her solution was to finance the Inflation Reduction Act by increasing the corporate minimum tax, ensuring that all businesses would pay at least 15 percent. This, Sinema said, made more sense than increasing the overall corporate tax \u2014 \u201cif your goal is tax fairness, which is mine.\u201d",
      "If that was her goal, I asked, then was she actually saying that the carried-interest loophole for the ultrawealthy was fair?",
      "\u201cWhat I think it is,\u201d she said, \u201cis an important tool to incentivize investment.\u201d",
      "An earlier version of Kyrsten Sinema \u2014 for example, the 2012 congressional candidate whose opening campaign ad promised that she would be a voice for \u201cthe powerless\u201d \u2014 would most likely have labeled her argument a defense of \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d It was also a shaky position on its own terms.",
      "I asked Arthur C. Nelson, emeritus professor of urban planning and real estate development at the University of Arizona, whether the carried-interest loophole was crucial to his state\u2019s real estate economy. Nelson sent me a set of numbers showing that the annual population growth rate in the three-decade period before the carried-interest provision was formalized in 1993 was 3.3 percent. In the three decades after the loophole was codified, annual growth was 2.1 percent. Assuming, as Nelson did, that population and real estate investment growth were correlated, then the carried-interest loophole had not spawned a housing boom. \u201cThe logic is nonsense,\u201d he said. Closing the loophole and using the revenue on homeowner and builder subsidies \u201cwould generate more housing than simply reducing taxes.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cIn full disclosure, I indeed benefit from the carried-interest loophole. But I personally oppose it for its lack of fairness. I worry that Senator Sinema\u2019s financial thinking is being led by self-styled \u2018masters of the finance universe,\u2019 instead of the masses who voted for her \u2014 me included.\u201d",
      " there was snow on the ground in the town of Whiteriver on the Fort Apache Reservation in northeastern Arizona, which the senator treaded through gingerly in the same boots she would wear at the border a month later. She was here to meet with members of the White Mountain Apache tribe at their invitation.",
      "For the next hour, Sinema sat in a crowded conference room, asking questions and taking notes as the tribal leaders discussed their need for more housing, more police cars and a jail with a roof that wouldn\u2019t collapse. Other than myself, only a couple of members from the tribal community media were present. Private security accompanied her. (Sinema has received death threats; at one point, her stepbrother, Paul Sheldon, told me, he and Sinema\u2019s father were informed by F.B.I. officials that threats had been made against them as well.)",
      "After hosting a few town halls with constituents during her first two years in the Senate, Sinema had since abandoned the practice, except for regular \u201ctele town halls\u201d on a virtual basis. Events like this one \u2014 small and restricted \u2014 have become the norm. To some friends, her reclusiveness is as inevitable as her break from the Democratic Party. \u201cI\u2019ve never in my life seen someone treated as poorly as they treated Sinema,\u201d the former Democratic congresswoman Kathleen Rice told me. \u201cTo me, it made all the sense in the world that she rejected the label of being a Democrat.\u201d Still, it seems impossible for her to continue to avoid openly engaging with Arizonans and somehow manage to win their votes in 2024.",
      "There was one additional item on the agenda that morning at the Fort Apache Reservation. The tribal leaders wanted to thank Sinema for ensuring that the community had at last gained access to clean drinking water. \u201cI worked with Republicans and Democrats in both chambers in the waning days of December to overcome the obstacles,\u201d Sinema told them. She then singled out three partners, all Republicans: Senators Tillis and Lee, and the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Bruce Westerman.",
      "These efforts have not been previously reported. When it came time to dole out favors in the 2021 infrastructure bill, among Sinema\u2019s requests was that all five Arizona tribes be guaranteed clean water. Tillis told her that he had an issue. He and his fellow North Carolina Republican, Senator Richard Burr, had put a hold on all tribal bills for the past three years. When she asked why they had done so, Tillis explained that the Lumbee tribe of North Carolina had yet to be federally recognized. Sinema pledged to help. \u201cKyrsten became the first legislator to invest time in what we were trying to accomplish for the Lumbees,\u201d Tillis told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why Burr and I agreed to remove the holds.\u201d",
      "Then Sinema learned that Lee, because of his longstanding view that tribal economic development should not require federal approval, had put holds on ",
      " tribal bills. She proceeded to work Lee as well. To Lee\u2019s aide who works on the issue, Sinema described the merits of what were now five individual Arizona tribal water bills. One day in mid-December, she received a text from the Utah senator. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d it said. Lee had pulled the holds.",
      "Finally, Sinema spoke with Westerman, a congressman from Arkansas whom she befriended back when she served in the House. He, too, had concerns: that the bills as written did not provide accounting for the expenditures. Sinema added language that did so. She called Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader for whom she had once been assistant whip, who now agreed to put the bills on the suspension calendar, making them eligible to pass by a voice vote. The amendments to the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act became law on Jan. 5, 2023.",
      "As I watched the tribal leaders present Sinema with an Apache blanket and a ceremonial basket, I remembered her friend Stephanie Murphy saying of her, \u201cI\u2019ve never met a person more focused or strategic.\u201d What was the strategic aim here? I recalled our conversation in February about her being five minutes late because of a driving-distance miscalculation that was immediately remedied. \u201cEverything is like a puzzle,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd so if there\u2019s a problem, we should solve it.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo you approach legislation as a puzzle?\u201d I asked her.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201c",
      ".\u201d She then went on: \u201cI think one of the big problems in negotiations is that often some \u2014 not exclusively men, but often men \u2014 are so busy talking about what they need, they\u2019re not spending any time hearing what someone else needs. But the key to solving a problem is to listen carefully and find out what someone needs and then figure out how to get it for them. If you give them what they need, you can get what you want.\u201d",
      "Was simply delivering clean water to the Apaches what Sinema wanted, or was there some electoral angle on the distant horizon? Maybe she needed Democrats to see her tending to the needs of the \u201cpowerless,\u201d as she had pledged to do when she first ran for Congress in 2011. Maybe an independent like Sinema needed to find votes wherever she could get them. Or perhaps it was satisfying enough simply to solve a puzzle that others couldn\u2019t. Making the system work was her greatest value, Portman told me: \u201cBy resolving disputes over amendments, over nominees, she helps the Senate operate.\u201d",
      "Sinema\u2019s role in the operation of the Senate during one of the most polarized periods in American political history has contributed to a remarkably successful legislative record for Democrats to showcase next year. \u201cHere\u2019s a woman who\u2019s delivered them major victories,\u201d Stephanie Murphy told me, \u201cand they campaign on this, after vilifying her.\u201d",
      "As strange as this eventuality might be, Sinema is not entirely blameless for it. An unnamed Democratic legislator told Politico that Sinema was \u201cthe biggest egomaniac in the Senate,\u201d which, if it were true, would be quite a distinction. None of her admiring colleagues \u2014 including Portman, Tillis and Romney \u2014 would deny Sinema\u2019s high estimation of her own abilities. But they described her to me as a uniquely skilled workhorse who deserved at least as much credit as she had been given, if not more. \u201cEveryone\u2019s out there campaigning on what she and a few of us did,\u201d Representative Scott Peters, a Democratic moderate from California and an ally of Sinema\u2019s, told me, referring to her stewardship of the infrastructure bill. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me, sort of funny in a way. I guess the legislation has to be its own reward sometimes.\u201d",
      "Peters entered Congress with Sinema in 2013. Together they worked on bills ranging from wildfire prevention to mental health care for veterans. He remembered meeting her at a restaurant, where he found her poring over a spreadsheet that was color-coded with infrastructure revenue options. It saddened him to think about her leaving the Democratic Party. When I asked Peters whether he would support her or Ruben Gallego in 2024, he paused before saying: \u201cIt may be awkward. I\u2019ll just say that Kyrsten Sinema has been my friend, and if she asked for my support, it would be hard to turn her down.\u201d",
      "He laughed ruefully. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to find friends in D.C. Just ask Kyrsten.\u201d",

      " almost universally entails tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta. However, a recent visit to Italy reminded me that the lasagna family is, in fact, vast and varied. There are hard-boiled egg and meatball-stuffed lasagnas from Naples; chicken liver studded ones from Le Marche; Bolognese and b\u00e9chamel-swathed examples from Emilia-Romagna.",
      "But there was one version that made me run to pull out my lasagna pan as soon as I got home: white lasagna. Made with a b\u00e9chamel sauce and often meatless, white lasagnas are plush, creamy showcases for seasonal vegetables \u2014 artichokes in spring, zucchini in summer, mushrooms in the fall, radicchio in winter \u2014 layered between thin sheets of pasta, then baked until golden.",
      "This version evokes spring with a combination of leeks, asparagus, spinach and peas, all of which are much quicker and easier to deal with than fresh artichokes. And into the bargain, having a mix of different vegetables gives this lasagna an exquisitely complex flavor.",
      "Like most lasagna recipes, it\u2019s a bit of a project. You need to make the b\u00e9chamel, saut\u00e9 the vegetables, then layer everything together with four kinds of cheese (mozzarella, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano and ricotta).",
      "But unlike some lasagna recipes, you don\u2019t have to make the pasta by hand. You don\u2019t even have to search out fresh lasagna noodles from the store. Dried noodles from the box (either no-boil or regular) work exceptionally well here, because the liquid from the b\u00e9chamel and all the vegetables will cook the noodles as the lasagna bakes, saving you what Marcella Hazan describes as the \u201cnecessary nuisance\u201d of cooking, washing, wringing and drying the pasta. One doesn\u2019t deviate from Marcella\u2019s instruction lightly, but that\u2019s a lot of nuisance.",
      "She and I do agree that lasagna suffers no harm from being prepared up to two days ahead. You can assemble it ahead and bake it as your guests arrive, or else assemble and bake it ahead, then reheat just before serving. Both methods make for a great dish, but you\u2019ll end up with a firmer, easier-to-slice lasagna if you bake ahead and reheat. Or you can time things to let the freshly baked lasagna rest for 30 minutes before serving.",
      "Lasagna may have left behind a lot of cousins in Italy when it became American, but there\u2019s still so much to learn from the extended family."

      "Balancing on the slippery, shimmering stones of the breathtaking bridge, with the cold waters of the Neretva River glistening far below, Amir Hanic pokes his nose up and takes his last breath. Without looking up or down, only straight ahead, he leaps from the bridge, his hands and feet stiff like the outstretched wings of a swooping bird.",
      "His descent lasts only a couple of seconds, but the audience surrounding him on the bridge has time to exclaim a collective \u201cOoh!\u201d \u2014 a mixture of admiration and fright. Amir disappears beneath the surface, then, reappearing, quickly swims back to shore, as if nothing had happened. Within moments, he\u2019s climbing back up to the bridge.",
      "With his plunge in the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, Amir and his friends from the local diving club are honoring a tradition that goes back some 400 years \u2014 \u201cto the Middle Ages, during the Ottoman era,\u201d says Amir, wiping his face with a towel. \u201cWe are protecting our cultural heritage and keeping the passage over the bridge clean.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are the guardians of the Mostar Bridge,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first recorded dive from the bridge in Mostar \u2014 known as the Old Bridge, or Stari Most \u2014 took place in the 17th century, around 100 years after its construction. Since 1968, the city has held an annual summer diving competition, which attracts participants from all over the world.",
      "Braving the drop of around 75 feet (it varies with the height of the river), this extreme stunt requires a healthy dose of courage. But as Amir ascends from the river to the bridge, walking past the ancient stone stairs, the picturesque streets, the backdrop of musicians in the bazaar, he has another task. With a hat in his hand, he collects donations from the crowd of onlookers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m done with diving today,\u201d he exclaims, still balancing on the edge of the bridge \u2014 but this time extending his arm toward the crowd. \u201cNow I have to raise some money for our club.\u201d",
      "When I traveled to Bosnia with the photographer Alessio Mamo in July 2021, much of our trip took place in the shadow of the violence that tore through the region in the 1990s, when, as Yugoslavia broke apart, war erupted between three ethnonationalist groups: Orthodox Christian Serbs, Catholic Croats and Bosniaks, or Bosnian Muslims.",

      "\u201cIt was much more difficult and dangerous to dive from the gangway,\u201d Admir tells me. \u201cYou had to take a run-up, with the risk of getting hurt.\u201d But even today, every dive is still a challenge, he says, requiring the utmost concentration.",
      "There are days when Admir dives as many as 10 or 12 times, he says, in the peak tourist season, between July and August. I speak with him during his break, while he sips coffee in the club\u2019s lounge. Behind him on the wall are paintings and pictures of the bridge in different historical eras, and of divers during their marvelous feats.",

A group of Knicks fans spotted another Knicks fan and started cursing. Other people turned their heads, cautiously moving away from the group; a fight seemed to be brewing.",
      "But as the fans walked toward each other, locked arms and began jumping around, it became clear that this was not about to be a brawl. At the center was Darryl Thompson, in a blue custom-made Knicks shirt with a four-letter word in orange and the name of the Heat\u2019s best player: Jimmy Butler. All of the cursing? That was just the fans, uh, reading the shirt\u2019s message out loud.",
      "\u201cI made it,\u201d Thompson, 37, said proudly. \u201cIt took about 30 minutes. I came up with an idea instantly and all that. I called some personal people to get it pressed up for me. We just made one. We don\u2019t want this floating around.\u201d",
      "Moments like that filled Sunday\u2019s Game 1 between the Knicks and the Heat, the first second-round playoff game at the Garden in a decade. During the Knicks\u2019 first-round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Knicks fans stormed Seventh Avenue outside the arena, climbed poles, danced and drank after victories.",
      "But on Sunday, the Knicks lost at home for the first time this postseason, 108-101, after being up by as much as 12 points during the first half. Seventh Avenue was desolate afterward, lined with police officers who were prepared for a raucous crowd but instead watched fans jump through puddles in the pouring rain as they headed for trains home. Game 2 is Tuesday at the Garden.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the fans from Sunday.",
      "Underneath Greg Dell\u2019s Knicks hat is his hairless head, which he uses to show people how long he has been a fan of the team. \u201cSince 12 years old,\u201d he yelled, \u201cback when I had hair.\u201d The Knicks\u2019 shortcomings over his 36 years of fandom have likely contributed to some of the hair loss, but he wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything else, he said. And once you turn 12 years old, he added, you can\u2019t change your team unless you move to a new city.",
      "Dell said this has been the most exciting Knicks season he can remember since the team went to the 1999 N.B.A. finals because they finally feel like a legitimate contender. He said he was \u201cthrowing away\u201d the Game 1 loss and predicted that the Knicks would wrap the series up in six games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like dating,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to find a loyal person \u2014 your spouse, your girlfriend \u2014 ask them their favorite team. If they say the Knicks, they\u2019re loyal. They\u2019re not cheating on you. They\u2019re not leaving you. That\u2019s us.\u201d",
      "Miguel Garcia and his two brothers, Danny and John, grew up in the long shadow of the Garden at 43rd Street and Ninth Avenue, close enough to hear some of the noise from around the arena on game days.",
      "Their first Knicks memory was from Game 3 of the 1999 Eastern Conference finals when forward Larry Johnson was fouled as he ",
      " and then swished the ensuing free throw to give the Knicks a 92-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers.",
      "On Sunday, they entered the Garden clad in different colored wigs they purchased from Party City because they \u201chad to go crazy\u201d for the special day.",
      "\u201cYou know, I have no hair, so I needed to put something on,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Francis Vasquez stopped others nearby from talking, seemingly so they could understand the importance of what he was about to say. Vasquez lifted one hand as they watched: This one was for God, he said, before lifting his other hand just slightly beneath that one, which, he said, was for the Knicks.",
      "Greg Dell and Vasquez met on Sunday after the game at a bar, and Vasquez said their relationship was reflective of what he loved about Knicks fandom.",
      "\u201cI could feel his energy, and he could feel my energy,\u201d he said, \u201cso that just builds a connection.\u201d",
      "Vasquez grew up in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, where he built an unrelenting support for a team that has never rewarded him for it with a title. Still, Vasquez said, he would \u201cdie for his Knicks.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let us win the championship; it\u2019s going to be a riot that day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get locked up that day.\u201d",
      "Leah Romito had never been interested in basketball. But over the last two seasons, her 8-year-old son, Axel, has fallen in love with Knicks forward Julius Randle and guard Jalen Brunson, turning her into a fan, too. On Sunday, she followed her son\u2019s directions, yelling and cheering as if she had been born into Knicks fandom like many of the others in the Garden.",

      ", but Randle sat out because of an ankle injury. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Axel said. \u201cVery sad.\u201d",
      "Lakeisha Reid paid $1,500 to go to the game with her girlfriend. She said she has been a Knicks fan since she was a teenager, drawn to the excitement that the former star center Patrick Ewing, who attended Sunday\u2019s game, brought her father and to people across New Jersey, where she grew up.",
      "Sunday was her first-ever Knicks game, so she planned an eye-popping outfit for the occasion that featured shiny blue pompoms. \u201cYou only live once,\u201d she said, \u201cand I was like, \u2018We want to do it right.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cUp north we\u2019re known for being a little hard, and sometimes we could be a little loud, but at the game it was just the up-north love, the vibe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just no drama. It was beautiful.\u201d",
      "Satchel Aviram grew up in Westchester County, N.Y., loving the Knicks for as long as he can remember. He appreciates the fan base primarily because Knicks fans are loyal through the few ups and the innumerable downs, unlike Nets fans, he said.",
      "\u201cThe second the Nets lose, they know it\u2019s over. When the Knicks lose, we know we\u2019re going to fight,\u201d Aviram said. \u201cThe team is behind the Knicks always, and the city is behind the Knicks.\u201d",

      "With the influx of Western thought and ideas in the newly open Tokyo in the late 19th century, intellectuals wrestled with the conflicts that arose between traditional Confucian ideologies and contemporary European spirituality. Natsume Soseki taught literature at the University of Tokyo after studying abroad in London, and, when he later became an author, he brilliantly sublimated those very conflicts in his novels. Such ideological tensions are not, however, outwardly apparent in his fantastical short stories, \u201c",

Just when you think the story has ended, the author himself makes an appearance in order to relay various episodes from the ever-changing city as part of the plot. Here, too, a nesting-box narrative enables the reader to contemplate the passage of time.",

      "A new study of genetic data from a market in Wuhan, China, said the data did not support the case that the pandemic had started with illegally traded animals, touching off fresh debate about samples that other scientists see as critical pieces of the puzzle of how the coronavirus reached humans.",
      "The ",
      ", which examined the relative amounts of animal and viral material in swabs taken from surfaces at the market in early 2020, said it was difficult to draw conclusions about whether given samples of the virus had come from infected live animals or were simply from incidental contamination.",
      "But several outside experts said the analysis, posted online this week by the study\u2019s author, Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, could have been affected by a number of unknown variables and decisions about how to filter the data.",
      "For those reasons, they said, the findings did not do much to sway their impression of previous studies. Samples from the market containing animal and viral genetic material, they said, were consistent with the possibility that an animal there \u2014 perhaps a raccoon dog \u2014 had spread the virus to people, but did not prove that had happened.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty reasonable chance they picked up an infected raccoon dog, but that doesn\u2019t prove that was the origin,\u201d said Frederic Bushman, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in analyzing samples like those taken from the Wuhan market, but who was not involved in any of the market studies. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Bloom paper changes my thinking that much.\u201d",
      "Chinese researchers ",
      " last year and then made the genetic sequences available this year, allowing a team of international scientists to study them. That team ",
      " last month that based on the data, they could not conclusively identify an animal that had passed the virus to people.",
      "But they said the data confirmed that animals believed to be susceptible to the virus, like raccoon dogs and masked palm civets, a small Asian mammal implicated in the SARS outbreak two decades ago, were being sold at the market in late 2019. Many of the earliest Covid-19 patients also worked or shopped at the market.",
      "Because the market was one of only four places in Wuhan reported to be selling live animals of the sort that could plausibly spread the virus, the scientists said it was unlikely that so many early patients were linked to the market purely by chance. They said the genetic data also built on other evidence, including that two early lineages of the virus had been at the market.",
      "This week\u2019s study took a different approach to analyzing the gene sequences.",
      "Dr. Bloom investigated whether the amount of genetic material from the virus correlated with the amount of genetic material from susceptible animal species in the samples. If one species at the market was overwhelmingly responsible for shedding the virus, he said\u00a0in an interview, he would have expected to see a clear link between the amount of genetic material from the virus and the amount from that species.",
      "But the study found no clear correlations\u00a0of that kind. Instead, the strongest correlations involved various fish sold at the market that could not have been infected, an indication that infected people had probably deposited viral material where the fish was.",
      "Dr. Bloom said that finding suggested that the virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, was spread widely across the market by the time the swabs were collected in early 2020.",
      "\u201cIn the same way we shouldn\u2019t read much of anything into the fact that there\u2019s a bunch of SARS-CoV-2 mixed with largemouth bass and catfish samples, we also shouldn\u2019t read much into the fact that there\u2019s a raccoon dog sample with a SARS-CoV-2 read,\u201d Dr. Bloom said.",
      "But outside experts said that various features of the samples could throw off efforts to correlate animal and viral material. The international scientists said in their report that they had considered running a similar analysis, but that it risked producing misleading results. Dr. Bloom acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s an open question of whether that is an informative thing to calculate at all.\u201d",
      "Genetic material from the virus degrades quickly, said Christopher Mason, a specialist in environmental sampling at Weill Cornell Medicine. Crucially, viral material may decay at a different rate than material from animals, making it difficult to compare them in samples collected over the course of weeks after the market\u2019s closure.",
      "It could be that fish were most closely associated with the virus simply because the fish were likely to have been frozen or refrigerated, slowing the decay of viral material in those samples, said Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist at KU Leuven in Belgium.",
      "The latest analysis \u201cconfirms that looking at these sorts of correlations tells you next to nothing with respect to which host species could have been a plausible source of the pandemic,\u201d Dr. Wenseleers said. This leaves scientists in the same situation as before, he said, with market data that doesn\u2019t offer conclusive evidence of any particular origin scenario.",
      "The new study also looked closely at a swab from a cart at the market in which the international team had found a\u00a0trace\u00a0of the virus alongside genetic signatures of raccoon dogs, but no detectable genetic material from humans.",
      "Dr. Bloom wrote that the swab had only a minuscule amount of viral material, and that it was not clear why Chinese researchers had classified the swab as Covid-positive. His study said that swab was the only one that had substantial amounts of raccoon dog genetic material with any traces of the virus.",
      "Some scientists, though, said Dr. Bloom\u2019s analysis risked dismissing other Covid-positive swabs by setting too high of a bar for the amount of animal genetic material in a sample.",
      "Dr. Bushman, of the University of Pennsylvania, said that the threshold used in the analysis was \u201caggressive\u201d and that it was best to compare results obtained from a series of different cutoffs.",
      "Using a more sensitive threshold, the international team of scientists identified multiple\u00a0Covid-positive samples containing raccoon dog genetic material, as well as others with genetic signatures of different\u00a0animals\u00a0thought to be susceptible to the virus.",
      "Alexander Crits-Christoph, a computational biologist formerly at Johns Hopkins University who helped lead the international team\u2019s analysis, said the team also looked closely at whether the Chinese researchers had been right to describe the swab from the cart as positive for the virus.",
      "He noted that a number of other swabs from the same stall were clearly positive for the virus. He said results from sampling elsewhere in the market also indicated that unlike the swab from the cart, most of the truly negative swabs contained no traces of the virus at all.",
      "\u201cThis is environmental sampling of a virus that is a tiny needle in a haystack,\u201d Dr. Crits-Christoph said."

Minorities and women had only recently gained access to its undergraduate programs. We recommended reforms, including the establishment of a Black student affairs office.",
      "But here we are, 50 years later, and race is still a core contention. If racism is not systemic, how could there have been so little progress for so long?",
      "This is a sad story and a tragic denouement for all the efforts of good people at U.Va. I deplore Mr. Ellis\u2019s attempts to further entrench a history of obliviousness to racism at U.Va. and so many other American institutions.",

Both of us serve today as trustees of Virginia\u2019s best universities, appointed by Virginia governors, though at different schools.",
      "Our paths and philosophies diverge dramatically, however. Mr. Ellis has declared a war on \u201cwoke,\u201d while I believe that \u201cwoke\u201d can be merely another word for welcoming. Our mission must always be to invite and respect all the extremely diverse communities we serve.",

Jefferson\u2019s personal failings as an enslaver, however, remind us of what is hypocritical, hurtful and tragic. At a school as great as U.Va., we can banish hagiography to seek the truth in all things, as Jefferson urged.",

I\u2019m not vouching for the calculation, though it seems reasonable at a glance. I\u2019m citing it because Khan has a new plan to make the ratio, whatever it is, even higher. It\u2019s all about harnessing artificial intelligence. I watched a ",
      " he gave on April 18 about his A.I. plans, and I interviewed him last week to get more information.",
      "More on A.I. in a minute. First, I want to say that I admire Khan because he does beautifully what I try to do myself, which is to make complicated ideas understandable. I\u2019ve watched dozens of his videos over the years to learn or relearn topics including statistics, calculus and science. He has a knack for walking through a problem patiently and developing an intuitive explanation that clicks. The payoff from watching one of his videos is that \u201caha\u201d moment when you suddenly get the concept.",
      "\u201cMy intellectual selfishness is that I really like making videos,\u201d Khan told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Though Khan Academy has grown immensely since he founded it in 2008 \u2014 it has more than 150 million registered users and is available in more than 50 languages \u2014 he said he still tries to spend a third of his time on content creation. (Though he\u2019s no longer the only person making videos.)",
      "\u201cMy trick is to know the material really well,\u201d Khan said. \u201cI spend a lot of time pondering. I\u2019m a professional ponderer. If I ponder something enough it will click. Then I have the confidence to just press record and start talking.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve gotten into arguments with some team members. They\u2019ll say, \u2018You covered only six of the objectives. Not eight.\u2019 But if the person gets the essence of it, they\u2019re off to the races.\u201d",
      "Khan told me that he got an email last June from Sam Altman and Greg Brockman of OpenAI, the research and development company behind ChatGPT. They wanted to work with him to show that their A.I. engine could be a force for good. They invited him to take an early look at GPT-4, the powerful language model that wasn\u2019t released to the public until this March. He went for a demo in July and was blown away. GPT-4 was far stronger than GPT-3.5, which itself was a knockout. GPT-3.5 powered the version of ChatGPT that caused a sensation when it was released in November.",
      "\u201cThe technology we were seeing was mind-blowing,\u201d Khan told me. \u201cIt was hard for me to keep it secret.\u201d",
      "Bill Gates had ",
      " OpenAI to build an artificial intelligence system that could pass the Advanced Placement biology test. So the OpenAI team used Khan Academy\u2019s course materials to train GPT-4 in biology. By September, the A.I. was answering nearly every A.P. biology exam question correctly and explaining its answers. \u201cIt was a this-changes-everything type of moment,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThis felt like it had a ton of potential.\u201d",
      "At the time and in the following months, when ChatGPT came out, most of the buzz around A.I. and education was negative. Teachers and parents worried that kids would use it to do their homework for them, including personalized essays. Khan saw it differently: \u201cWe said, \u2018There\u2019s a way that we can do this right, with proper guardrails.\u2019\u201d",
      "Khan and his team used GPT-4 as the engine behind software called Khanmigo (\u201cKhan\u201d plus \u201camigo\u201d \u2014 a little goofy).",
      "Khanmigo isn\u2019t supposed to give away answers. Like a good flesh-and-blood tutor, it engages students in a Socratic dialogue to guide them. It\u2019s good at figuring out what they aren\u2019t getting. Plus, Khan said, \u201cit lets students do things you could never do before, like talk to literary or historical characters.\u201d He chuckled about one girl who had a conversation with an A.I. incarnation of Jay Gatsby. The experience was so real to her that when she finished she apologized for taking so much of the character\u2019s time. For safety, all interactions with students are recorded and shared with parents and teachers.",
      "Khanmigo is being tested in the public schools of Newark, N.J., as well as in School City of Hobart in Indiana, a charter school in Phoenix, the Mountain View, Calif., campus of Khan Lab School and Khan World School, which offers classes online.",
      "There have been some growing pains. For example, GPT-4 doesn\u2019t understand what it spits out and is ",
      ". It can generate wrong answers, which it gives with supreme confidence. Khan said that he and Kristen DiCerbo, the chief learning officer of Khan Academy, and others spent two weeks giving Khanmigo guidance on the ideal way to respond as a math tutor. He said the tool is much better at math now.",
      "Another concern: When I tried Khanmigo on finance, I found that when I played dumb and asked for hints, it pretty much gave me the answers. \u201cThat\u2019s good feedback,\u201d Khan told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to thread the needle between giving people too much and not enough.\u201d",

Recently, he told me, he used it to satisfy his curiosity about an aspect of supernovas. He said it\u2019s better at helping his kids with their programming homework than he is, even though he has a master\u2019s degree in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt is eerily good,\u201d he said.",

      "Texas was gasping for electricity. Winter Storm Uri had knocked out power plants across the state, leaving tens of thousands of homes in icy darkness. By the end of Feb. 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died, some from the freezing cold.",
      "Meanwhile, in the husk of a onetime aluminum smelting plant an hour outside of Austin, row upon row of computers were using enough electricity to power about 6,500 homes as they raced to earn Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.",
      "The computers were performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for an elusive combination of numbers that Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm would accept. About every 10 minutes, a computer somewhere guesses correctly and wins a small number of Bitcoins worth, in recent weeks, about $170,000. Anyone can try, but to make a business of it can require as much electricity as a small city.",
      "In Texas, the computers kept running until just after midnight. Then the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them shut off, under an agreement that allowed it to do so if the system was about to fail. In return, it began paying the Bitcoin company, Bitdeer, an average of $175,000 an hour to keep the computers offline. Over the next four days, Bitdeer would make more than $18 million for not operating, from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm.",
      "The New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as Bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs \u2014 including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution \u2014 for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with Bitcoin.",
      "Until June 2021, most Bitcoin mining was in China. Then it drove out Bitcoin operations, at least for a time, citing their power use among other reasons. The United States quickly became the industry\u2019s global leader.",
      "Since then, precisely how much electricity Bitcoin mines are using in America and their effect on energy markets and the environment have been unclear. The Times, using both public and confidential records as well as the results of studies it commissioned, put the most comprehensive estimates to date on the largest operations\u2019 power use and the ripple effects of their voracious demand.",
      "It is as if another New York City\u2019s worth of residences were now drawing on the nation\u2019s power supply, The Times found.",
      "In some areas, this has led prices to surge. In Texas, where 10 of the 34 mines are connected to the state\u2019s grid, the increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly 5 percent, or $1.8 billion per year, according to a simulation performed for The Times by the energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.",
      "The additional power use across the country also causes as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to America\u2019s roads, according to an analysis by WattTime, a nonprofit tech company. Many of the Bitcoin operations promote themselves as environmentally friendly and set up in areas rich with renewable energy, but their power needs are far too great to be satisfied by those sources alone. As a result, they have become a boon for the fossil fuel industry: WattTime found that coal and natural gas plants kick in to meet 85 percent of the demand these Bitcoin operations add to their grids.",
      "Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, like factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.",
      "In some states, notably New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, Bitcoin operators\u2019 revenue can ultimately come from other power customers. The clearest example is Texas, where Bitcoin companies are paid by the grid operator for promising to quickly power down if necessary to prevent blackouts. In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down and instead earn additional money while doing exactly what they would have been doing anyway: seeking Bitcoin. Five operations have collectively made at least $60 million from that program since 2020, records show.",
      "Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.",
      "The windfall for Bitdeer during Winter Storm Uri came through this program, in exchange for a fraction of the power it typically used. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Another Bitcoin company made tens of millions of dollars reselling electricity during the storm \u2014 and ultimately stands to earn as much as $125 million \u2014 according to its financial filings, which were previously reported by the ",
      ". A third company ",
      " that another natural disaster like Uri could be a significant business opportunity.",
      "\u201cIronically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid,\u201d said Ed Hirs, who teaches energy economics at the University of Houston and has been critical of the industry.",
      "In interviews and statements, many of the companies said they were no different from other large power users except for their willingness to shut off quickly to benefit the grid. Several objected to the method The Times and WattTime used to estimate their emissions, which calculated the pollution caused by the additional power generated to satisfy the mines\u2019 demand, showing it to overwhelmingly come from fossil fuels.",
      "The companies said this method held them to an unfair standard.",
      "\u201cThe analysis cited could be used to attack any industry that consumes power,\u201d said David Fogel, the chief executive of Coinmint, which operates in upstate New York. \u201cI think the entire notion of singling out specific industries like this is unfair.\u201d",
      "But WattTime\u2019s method is the one many energy and climate experts recommend for measuring the environmental effects of increased power use by any industry, particularly one that grows so large so suddenly.",
      "Some in the industry have pushed back against suggestions that it is directly responsible for any environmental harm.",
      "A May 2022 ",
      " to the Environmental Protection Agency, signed by many of the biggest companies, said their operations \u201creleased\u201d no pollutants. \u201cBitcoin miners have no emissions whatsoever,\u201d it said. \u201cAssociated emissions are a function of electricity generation.\u201d",
      "Nic Carter, a partner at a crypto-focused venture capital firm and a",
      "prominent Bitcoin advocate who told The Times he was the letter\u2019s primary author, said he was playing a \u201clanguage game\u201d when he wrote that Bitcoin mining has no emissions. At the time, he said, he felt the industry was being unfairly singled out.",
      "\u201cMaybe the more sincere point is like, we\u2019re already fully aware of the emissions associated with utilities generating grid power,\u201d he said.",
      "Many academics who study the energy industry said Bitcoin mining was undoubtedly having significant environmental effects.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re adding hundreds of megawatts of new demand when we already face the need to rapidly cut fossil power,\u201d said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor who studies electrical grid emissions.",
      "\u201cIf you care about climate change,\u201d he added, \u201cthen that\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "Bitcoin, conceived in 2008, introduced most of the world to the concept of cryptocurrencies. Instead of trusting banks to track the value of accounts, the system publishes transactions on a public ledger called a blockchain. Proponents said that cutting out middlemen would free people from financial institutions, government oversight and fees.",
      "So-called mining is a fundamental part of the system: When a computer guesses correctly, it updates the ledger and collects six and a quarter new Bitcoins. Then the guessing game begins again.",
      "Initially, hobbyists could win with personal computers, but as the value of each Bitcoin soared \u2014 from under $1,000 in 2017 to above $60,000 in 2021 \u2014 mining increasingly became an industrial endeavor. (The price has since dropped and, as of publication, was roughly $28,000.)",
      "The only way for miners to better their odds is to add computing power, which requires more electricity. But as the number of guesses increases, the algorithm makes the game more difficult. This has created an energy arms race.",
      "The mines\u2019 scale can draw gasps from people in the power industry. A one-megawatt mine consumes more energy each day than a typical U.S. home does in two years. The electricity coursing through a 100-megawatt operation at a given moment could power about half the homes in Cleveland, according to federal data.",
      "Aspects of the industry have previously been ",
      " in news articles and ",
      " and ",
      ", including broad estimates of the environmental effects. But The Times cross-referenced financial disclosures, land records and satellite imagery to create the first national accounting of the biggest operations. The analysis includes mines operating at approximately 40 megawatts or higher, although dozens more exist below that threshold.",
      "Of course, other industries, including metals and plastics manufacturing, also require large amounts of electricity, causing pollution and raising power prices. But Bitcoin mines bring significantly fewer jobs, often employing only a few dozen people once construction is complete, and spur less local economic development.",
      "Their financial benefit flows almost exclusively to their owners and operators. In 2021, the year Bitcoin\u2019s price peaked, 20 executives at five publicly traded Bitcoin companies together received nearly $16 million in salary and over $630 million in stock options, records show.",
      "The industry has been less profitable since then, as Bitcoin\u2019s value has dropped and electricity prices have climbed. Two of the largest United States-based companies have filed for bankruptcy. Still, new mines continue to open across the country",
      "There are ways to operate a cryptocurrency using far less electricity. Last year, Ethereum, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, reduced the electricity needed to power the network by more than 99 percent by switching its algorithm. Now it rewards people and trusts them to update the ledger because they are willing to put up their own money as collateral, not because they have spent money to power guessing computers, as Bitcoin does.",
      "But Bitcoin advocates oppose changing their algorithm, saying that it has proved resistant to attacks for longer and at a greater scale than any other approach. In practice, they say, the more computers making guesses, the safer the network.",
      "As Bitcoin mining has spread, countries around the world have found that operations strained their power grids. In 2019, China declared the industry \u201c",
      "\u201d and banned it in 2021. Many operations moved to ",
      " and ",
      ", which also enacted restrictions.",
      "And shipping pallets piled high with Bitcoin-mining computers ",
      ", where some states welcomed them in.",
      "Just north of Jamestown, N.D., the land is flat, trees are scarce and, in winter, snow drifts can easily top 10 feet. Even when brisk prairie winds blow, the shrill whine of the fans within Applied Digital\u2019s Bitcoin mine can be heard a half-mile away.",
      "They are working to cool more than 30,000 computers, stacked two stories high, stretching for hundreds of feet alongside signs that read \u201cDanger \u2014 High Voltage.\u201d The radiating heat melts the snow on one side of each of the operation\u2019s eight buildings.",
      "The mine has 33 employees and uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as all the homes in the 16,000-person town. It is one of three mines in the state that together consume nearly as much power as every home in North Dakota.",
      "Few other states have been as welcoming to Bitcoin companies. In October 2021, Gov. Doug Burgum presented an ",
      " to local officials and a power provider for bringing a mine to Grand Forks. Months later, he announced the development of a $1.9 billion Bitcoin operation in Williston. And last spring, he ",
      " a switch at the Jamestown mine\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony.",
      "The Bitcoin operations\u2019 effect on the state\u2019s economy is simple, said Josh Teigen, the commerce commissioner: \u201cThey are propping up our fossil fuel industry, and that\u2019s exactly what we want.\u201d",
      "North Dakota has an abundance of lignite, a type of coal primarily used to generate electricity. Mr. Teigen said the state hopes to ultimately",
      "capture the carbon from fossil fuel power plants and store it underground, reducing emissions while keeping the coal industry alive",
      "The state also has a large amount of wind power, which is what attracted",
      "Applied Digital, said Wes Cummins, its chief executive.",
      "His company is not alone. Many Bitcoin businesses promote their ability to operate in rural areas where renewable energy is abundant.",
      "But those claims have hit a hard reality: A vast majority of that renewable energy would be used even in the absence of the mines, so fossil fuel plants almost always need to produce additional electricity as a result of their operations.",
      "For example, the Jamestown mine\u2019s power demand causes coal or natural gas energy providers to generate electricity more than 90 percent of the time, WattTime found.",
      "Using a technique known as ",
      ", WattTime examined each mine\u2019s location and power use, identified which types of power plants had generated the additional energy needed, and estimated the resulting pollution. That method, and WattTime in particular, were recommended in a report by the Crypto Climate Accord, an initiative to reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint supported by more than 200 cryptocurrency companies.",
      "The analysis found that the 34 mines\u2019 power use was causing nearly 16.4 million tons of carbon pollution each year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d Mr. Cummins said, when told the estimates for Applied Digital\u2019s Jamestown operation. He said his operation uses the electricity that is available on the grid and cannot control whether it comes from clean or dirty sources, which is affected by all customers\u2019 demand. The miners generally prefer calculating emissions based on that mix of power.",
      "Using that method, WattTime estimated that they consume 54 percent fossil fuel-generated power, resulting in nearly 10.4 million tons of carbon emissions.",
      "Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, a Bitcoin lobbying group, said in an email that the industry incentivizes the development of new renewable and natural gas plants. But power industry experts say that while some current wind farms may be benefiting modestly, renewable generation takes years to build and usually requires commitments from customers who can guarantee that they will buy power for a decade or more.",
      "According to Dr. Jenkins at Princeton, the Bitcoin operations\u2019 near-constant power demand is more likely to keep fossil fuel plants in business than to lead to more renewable energy.",
      "This proved true in upstate New York, where a gas-powered plant reopened and now powers a Bitcoin mine. Three other large operations are run by companies that also own the fossil fuel plants where they operate, including two burning waste coal in Pennsylvania.",
      "Some of the Bitcoin companies that WattTime found to be causing the most pollution have held themselves out as supporting renewables.",
      "For example, Riot Platforms\u2019 chief executive described Bitcoin mining as \u201cuniquely beneficial and supportive of renewable energy.\u201d Ninety-six percent of the power demand added by the company\u2019s mine was met by fossil fuels, the WattTime analysis showed.",
      "Mining Bitcoin produces steady revenue, but using so much electricity can also be a business model.",
      "Moments of extreme weather provide especially stark examples. Take June 23, 2022 \u2014 the eighth straight day of near-100-degree temperatures around Austin, which allowed Riot Platforms to demonstrate several ways they can turn electricity into money.",
      "Like many industrial buyers, the company had prepurchased its power at a fraction of the price available to residential customers. Riot\u2019s mine runs at 450 megawatts \u2014 the largest in the country.",
      "Each day that June, its computers\u2019 guesses were winning Bitcoin worth an average of about",
      "$342,000. But the company had two additional ways to improve its profit margins.",
      "First, it had signed up for the Responsive Reserve Service, a Texas power grid program that offers a way to quickly reduce strain if the grid becomes overloaded, acting as insurance against blackouts. The program pays miners, and other companies, for promising to stop using electricity upon request. In reality, they are rarely asked to shut down, but are still paid for making the pledge.",
      "From midnight to nearly 4 p.m. on June 23, Riot earned more than $42,000 from the program while continuing to mine Bitcoin. (Overall in 2022, Riot made nearly $9.3 million from participating in the program nearly 85 percent of the time, the data shows, though the grid operator asked companies to actually lower their use for about 3.5 hours.)",
      "Around that time, the company switched to the second technique: avoiding fees that Texas charges to maintain and strengthen the power grid. It did so by briefly shutting off almost completely.",
      "To incentivize big customers to conserve electricity, those fees are based on how much electricity they use during several peak summer moments. Riot reduced its power use by more than 99 percent.",
      "By 6:30 p.m., the company had resumed mining. If Riot had been fully operating all day, it would have incurred an estimated $5.5 million in fees \u2014 costs that are largely made up by other Texans. Over the course of the year, this saved Riot more than $27 million in potential fees.",
      "The company\u2019s actions were described in data published by the Texas grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT. Though the records refer to power suppliers by pseudonyms, The Times was able to identify six of the 10 Texas operations in the data.",
      "One final mechanism lets some companies make extra money when electricity prices spike: They can stop mining and resell electricity to other customers. That earned Riot roughly $18 million last year.",
      "From Bitcoin mining, the company earned $156.9 million last year.",
      "Five of the six Texas mines in the power grid data participate in the Responsive Reserve program. All six chose to turn off nearly every time fees were assessed in 2022, saving an estimated $62 million in fees.",
      "When asked whether Bitcoin companies are disproportionately able to take advantage of both programs, ERCOT said in a statement that it \u201cdoes not discriminate based on the type or activity\u201d of the companies that sign up.",
      "It is not unusual for companies in Texas to be able to anticipate moments when fees will be assessed and to reduce their demand, but unlike Bitcoin miners, most can stop using on average 5 percent to 30 percent of their electricity, industry consultants say.",
      "In a statement, Riot said it reducing its power load helped all power customers.",
      "\u201cThe company\u2019s decision to actively reduce its load during anticipated times of peak demand adds to grid reliability and ultimately helps to reduce peak power prices,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Mr. Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council said the benefits outweigh the cost.",
      "\u201cIn addition to providing jobs and positive economic impact, Bitcoin miners turn off when power prices rise and that power is then available for commercial and residential users,\u201d he said.",
      "Others say the companies are capitalizing on weaknesses in programs designed for very different industries.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re exploiting the system,\u201d said Severin Bornstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies electricity pricing. \u201cBut they will say, \u2018You know, the system was already there,\u2019 and I\u2019m sympathetic to that in some ways.\u201d",
      "After accounting for the savings and revenue from each of the strategies, Riot told investors its electricity cost in 2022 was 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour.",
      "By comparison, the average price for other industrial businesses in Texas was 7.2 cents.",
      "For",
      "residents, it was 13.5 cents.",
      "These opportunities have led some of the country\u2019s largest Bitcoin operations to choose Texas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a massive financial burden to Texans,\u201d said Ben Hertz-Shargel, who leads grid-related research at Wood Mackenzie, and was part of the team that conducted the market-based simulation for The Times based on historical ERCOT data. Because of how the Texas market operates, the increases are steepest for residential customers, said Mr. Hertz-Shargel, who has previously criticized Bitcoin\u2019s dependence on electricity as \u201cinessential.\u201d",
      "Others say increased prices will incentivize the development of cheaper types of power generation.",
      "\u201cExpanding Texas generation is crucial, and allowing different energy sources to compete in the market will help drive down prices,\u201d said Gideon Powell, chief executive at Cholla, an energy exploration company in Texas that is developing Bitcoin mines.",
      "As of last month, ERCOT had approved plans to connect an additional ",
      " of Bitcoin operations this year, which would nearly triple their consumption in Texas.",
      "In Congress, Democrats have called for a precise inventory of operations\u2019 power use and resulting emissions. Republicans have largely supported the industry, including by introducing a congressional resolution last month affirming its importance to the country\u2019s energy goals and economy.",
      "And in Texas, the companies have powerful allies. Gov. Greg Abbott said in a ",

Still, in March, three Republican state senators joined in ",
      " that would restrict tax breaks for miners and place strict limits on their participation in programs like the Responsive Reserve.",
      "In Rockdale, where two of the largest mines in the country operate just outside the city limits, the city manager, Barbara Holly, told The Times that the town used to be \u201ca fairly wealthy little community.\u201d She said that changed when a large industrial plant that had provided thousands of jobs closed more than a decade ago. \u201cIt just cut the legs out from under this community,\u201d she said.",

Companies confirmed the operating levels of 21 mines, declined to confirm specific numbers for five others and did not respond to repeated requests regarding the remaining eight.

      "California state regulators approved on Friday a ban on the sale of new big rigs and buses that run on diesel by 2036, going beyond the federal government in issuing requirements to reduce emissions and setting the stage for other states to follow suit.",
      "The rule is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious moves by California and the federal government to curb planet-warming pollution from vehicles, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gases.",
      "The California Air Resources Board approved the regulation, which by 2045 would fully eliminate the sale of new trucks that emit carbon dioxide across the state. The rule builds in intermediate goals in the coming years for government organizations and private companies to decrease their use of diesel trucks.",
      "The ban, if approved by the federal government, would create the most stringent practices related to truck emissions in the country, keeping California at the forefront of states in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Some large companies have already begun to use heavy-duty vehicles that emit little to no carbon dioxide, but the plan would require a complete transition in new truck purchases by 2036.",
      "\u201cThis rule provides manufacturers, truck owners and fueling providers the assurance that there will be a market and the demand for zero-emissions vehicles, while providing a flexible path to making the transition toward clean air,\u201d Liane Randolph, chair of the board, said in a statement.",
      "But the American Trucking Associations, a trade organization for the trucking industry, criticized the ban, saying that it has worked to significantly reduce emissions but needs more flexibility. Chris Spear, the president and chief executive of the group, said California was setting \u201cunrealistic targets and unachievable timelines\u201d that will increase costs.",
      "The state hopes the ban will save money related to health costs caused by pollution, including asthma attacks and respiratory illness.",
      "When California, the nation\u2019s largest car and truck market, sets new rules on tailpipe pollution, it has an impact across the rest of the country \u2014 and the world. The state has for decades been at the vanguard of the nation\u2019s clean air regulations. California is unique among the states in that the 1970 Clean Air Act allows it to set tighter air pollution rules than those used by the federal government \u2014 and historically, when it does so, the federal government often follows. While the ban on diesel truck sales would be the only one of its kind in the world, many other states and, eventually, the federal government could enact similar policies, which could in turn influence global policies, since trucks are manufactured and driven around the world.",
      "California and the Biden administration have spent the past two years working closely to advance a series of increasingly ambitious regulations designed to curb climate-warming and other pollutants from vehicle tailpipes. In April, the ",
      " designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. Those proposals were designed to complement a ",
      " banning the sale of new gasoline-powered cars after 2035, as well as a ",
      " requiring that half of all garbage trucks, tractor-trailers, cement mixers and other heavy vehicles sold in the state must be all-electric by 2035.",

      "Forecasters from the World Meteorological Organization are reporting increased chances that the global climate pattern known as El Ni\u00f1o will arrive by the end of summer. With it comes increased chances for hotter-than-normal temperatures in 2024.",
      "While there is not yet a clear picture of how strong the El Ni\u00f1o event will be or how long it might last, even a relatively mild one could affect precipitation and temperature patterns around the world.",
      "\u201cThe development of an El Ni\u00f1o will most likely lead to a new spike in global heating and increase the chance of breaking temperature records,\u201d said Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the meteorological organization, in a news release.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o is associated with warmer-than-normal ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. In the United States, it tends to lead to rainier, cooler conditions in much of the South, and warmer conditions in parts of the North.",

For the past several years, as his robusta trees have succumbed to pests and disease, he has replaced them with Liberica trees. On his six acres Mr. John now has just 50 robustas, and 1,000 Libericas.",

      "Another variety is Liberica excelsa, the one that is native to the lowlands of Uganda. Compared with robusta, which is also native to Uganda and the dominant coffee species grown in the region, Liberica takes longer to mature and produce fruit.",
      "Libericas tower over robustas. Each tree can grow to a height of eight meters, so farmers need to hoist themselves up on bamboo ladders to harvest them. Or else they need to prune the trees so their branches grow wide and not up.",
      "Around 200 farmers have been growing Liberica in small pockets, selling it to local traders together with their robusta harvest, and getting robusta prices. Dr. Kiwuka said she felt as though the farmers \u201cwere cheated.\u201d",
      "Liberica has a stronger aroma and is a higher quality coffee, she said; farmers should have been getting higher prices.",
      "In 2016, she invited Aaron Davis, a coffee scientist from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, England, to Zirobwe. He was skeptical at first. He had tasted Liberica elsewhere and found it to be like \u201cvegetable soup,\u201d he said.",

      "\n\tFor a century, hydroelectric power has been synonymous with gigantic dams \u2014 feats of engineering that provide renewable energy but displace communities and destroy ecosystems.\n",
      "\n\tNew research released Tuesday by Global Energy Monitor reveals a transformation underway in hydroelectric projects \u2014 using the same gravitational qualities of water, but typically without building large, traditional dams like the Hoover in the American West or Three Gorges in China. Instead, a technology called pumped storage is rapidly expanding.\n",
      "\n\tThese systems involve two reservoirs: one on top of a hill and another at the bottom. When electricity generated from nearby power plants exceeds demand, it\u2019s used to pump water uphill, essentially filling the upper reservoir as a battery. Later, when electricity demand spikes, water is released to the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating power.\n",
      "\n\tPumped storage isn\u2019t a new idea. But it is undergoing a renaissance in countries where wind and solar power are also growing, helping allay concerns about weather-related dips in renewable energy output.\n",
      "\n\t\u201cOur data show that pumped storage is set to grow much faster than conventional dams,\u201d said Joe Bernardi, who runs Global Energy Monitor\u2019s hydropower tracker. \u201cThis trend is most pronounced in China, which accounts for over 80 percent of planned projects worldwide.\u201d\n",
      "\n\tSome of the largest systems produce enough energy to power two million average American homes for an hour.\n",
      "\n\tIn recent years, China has accounted for about half of global growth in renewable energy. According to official documents, China will roll out more wind and solar capacity each year between now and 2030 than Germany currently has in total.\n",
      "\n\tAs renewables contribute more and more to China\u2019s grid, the country is seeking ways to ensure that fluctuations in wind and solar output don\u2019t leave the grid in the lurch. Some of that insurance comes from continued growth in fossil fuels, especially coal, which China has in abundance.\n",
      "\n\tChina\u2019s pumped storage strategy won\u2019t directly equate to a reduction in coal use. China has stopped financing coal projects abroad, but at home last year it approved the building of more coal plants than ever before. And it is already by far the world\u2019s biggest user of coal, a particularly dirty fuel.\n",
      "\n\tBut even as China doubles down on coal, it is reducing the overall proportion of power it derives from it. China now leads the world in wind, solar and hydroelectric power capacity.\n",
      "\n\t\u201cFor China, pumped storage is the winning horse to provide a flexible backup for wind and solar. It is cheaper than the other battery options and can store more energy,\u201d said Liu Hongqiao, an independent energy consultant focused on renewables in China.\n",
      "\n\tPumped storage has also been critical in making the business case for renewable energy in China, Ms. Liu said, because the national grid is not prepared to take on 100 percent of the wind and solar energy in the pipeline. Some of it will have to be stored, if it isn\u2019t to be wasted, she said.\n",
      "\n\t\u201cCoal in China isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon,\u201d said Cosimo Ries, an analyst at the research firm Trivium China. \u201cBut over the coming decades it will gradually become a flexible power source, and a lesser one compared to pumped hydro.\u201d\n",
      "\n\tGlobal Energy Monitor data shows another kind of hydroelectric technology becoming prevalent, particularly in mountainous places like Nepal. So-called run-of-river facilities are located, as the name suggests, on rivers, but don\u2019t create giant reservoirs behind them.\n",
      "\n\tWithout the reservoir, power generation is dependent on seasonal water flows but is less environmentally damaging and less prone to catastrophic failures in tectonically active zones like the Himalayas. Hundreds of run-of-river facilities have been built or are in the pipeline across the world, though they tend to produce smaller amounts of power.\n",
      "\n\tEnvironmental disruption isn\u2019t the only reason conventional dams are becoming less prevalent. They are also bad at saving water because their reservoirs provide large surface areas for evaporation. And when installed on rivers that cross international borders, they can often lead to water disputes. Many rivers simply have too many dams already.\n",
      "\n\tHydroelectric reservoirs can also release considerable methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from microbes that thrive in these environments and as vegetation decomposes in flooded areas. According to Dr. Bridget Deemer, an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, reservoirs could be the source of 3 to 7 percent of methane emissions caused by humans.\n"

      ", fall in by accident? While studies suggest that the plants\u2019 colors and its nectar may attract prey, some scientists think pitchers\u2019 scent may play a role as well.",

      ", a research team identified odor molecules emanating from four types of pitcher plants and found that the scents seemed to be correlated with the kinds of insects that wound up in the pitchers. While the study is small and more work is needed to confirm the link, the findings suggest that when insects meet their deaths at the bottom of a pitcher, it may be an aroma they\u2019re following.",
      "Humans tend to describe a pitcher plants\u2019 scent as floral or herbal, said Laurence Gaume, a scientist the French National Centre for Scientific Research and an author of the new paper. Insects may find the scent more striking. ",
      " that pitchers emitting more volatile compounds tended to attract more flies, but rigorous examinations of what exactly pitchers release and whether it\u2019s connected to the insects they attract have been missing.",
      "To answer this question, Dr. Gaume and her colleagues grew four different types of Sarracenia",
      "pitcher plants at their research station in Montpelier, France. They sampled the air above 39 of the pitchers, identifying dozens of volatile compounds, and sliced a number of pitchers open to sort through their contents. They also measured the pitchers\u2019 width and depth, to see whether their shape contributed to the type of prey they caught.",
      "Pitchers with aromas that were heavy on monoterpenes, fragrant substances known to attract pollinators, seemed to catch more moths and bees, the group found, while those emitting more fatty acids ended up with more flies and ants. Pitcher shape, too, was correlated with certain kinds of prey: Longer pitchers were heavier on bees and moths, while shorter pitchers caught more ants.",
      "In other words, it seems unlikely that insects are just falling into a given pitcher by chance, Dr. Gaume said.",
      "Future experiments might probe whether pitcher scents painted onto fake plants draw insects\u2019 attention the same way, or whether altering pitcher color or shape affect the allure of the odors.",
      "Some of the pitcher plants used in Dr. Gaume and colleagues\u2019 research are native to North America \u2014 in fact, they can be found in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Dr. Gaume wonders whether the same connections between scents emitted and prey caught would show up in plants grown outside of the experimental conditions of the study. She has hopes of a much larger study in North America someday to further explore these findings, with row after row of sprightly death traps, all releasing come-hither odors into the air."

      "But scientists didn\u2019t just affix this device for laughs: They are curious about the underlying brain mechanisms that allow fish to navigate their world, and how such mechanisms relate to the evolutionary roots of navigation for all creatures with brain circuitry.",
      "\u201cNavigation is an extremely important aspect of behavior because we navigate to find food, to find shelter, to escape predators,\u201d said Ronen Segev, a neuroscientist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel who was part of a team that fitted 15 fish with cybernetic headgear for a study ",
      ".",
      "Putting a computer on a goldfish to study how the neurons fire in its brain while navigating wasn\u2019t easy.",
      "It takes a careful hand because a goldfish\u2019s brain, which looks a bit like a small cluster of lentils, is only half an inch long. \u201cUnder a microscope, we exposed the brain and put the electrodes inside,\u201d said Lear Cohen, a neuroscientist and doctoral candidate at Ben-Gurion who performed the surgeries to attach the devices. Each of those electrodes was the diameter of a strand of human hair.",
      "It was also tricky to find a way to perform the procedure on dry land without harming the test subject. \u201cThe fish needs water and you need him not to move,\u201d he said. He and his colleagues solved both problems by pumping water and anesthetics into the fish\u2019s mouth.",
      "Once the electrodes were in the brain, they were connected to a small recording device, which could monitor neuronal activity and which was sealed in a waterproof case, mounted on the fish\u2019s forehead. To keep the computer from weighing the fish down and impeding its ability to swim, the researchers attached buoyant plastic foam to the device.",
      "After recovering from surgery, the fish debuted their headgear in an experiment. The goldfish navigated a two-foot-long, six-inch-wide tank. The closer the fish swam to the tank\u2019s edges, the more the navigational cells in their brains lit up.",
      "The fish\u2019s brain-computer helped reveal that goldfish use a system of navigation that is subtly different from ",
      ". For humans (and other members of our class), navigational cells specialize in pinging our precise location within our environment and building a map around that spot. Mammals have specialized neurons that create these \u201cyou are here\u201d pins in their mental maps; the researchers didn\u2019t find those cells in fish.",
      "Instead, goldfish rely on a type of neuron that fires to let the animal know it is approaching a boundary or an obstacle. By combining the information about how far it is from various barriers, the fish is able to orient itself in space.",
      "The mammalian navigation system, Dr. Segev said, amounts to cells that let an animal determine \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here.\u201d In goldfish, he said, the cells work to impart a different message: \u201cI\u2019m in this position along this axis, and this position along a different axis.\u201d",
      "Mr. Cohen suspects that the variations in animals\u2019 navigation circuits may correspond to the different challenges they face getting around their habitats. For instance, he said, the ever-shifting currents of a watery home could mean that, for fish, \u201cit\u2019s easier to know the distance from a salient feature in the environment than knowing an exact position.\u201d",
      "All of the experiments were approved by the university\u2019s animal welfare committee and the researchers euthanized the fish after their swimming trials so they could further examine their brains. The team hopes to continue learning how and why fish\u2019s navigational systems differ from ours.",
      "Adelaide Sibeaux, a biologist at Oxford University who was not involved with the study, said she found the project \u201cpretty amazing\u201d as well as important.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re modifying a lot of animals\u2019 environments, and, if you understand how an animal navigates, you will know if they are able to cope with changes that are happening in the world at the moment,\u201d Dr. Sibeaux said; for fish, that could include water that becomes murkier because of pollution."

      "\u201cSpinning around to make ourselves dizzy is something we usually think of as a distinctly human activity,\u201d said Marcus Perlman, a cognitive scientist at the University of Birmingham in England and an author of the study. \u201cSo it\u2019s really cool to find that other primates do this, too, and that they seem to do it for the same reason that children do: because it\u2019s fun and exhilarating.\u201d",
      "After Dr. Perlman saw the videos of Zola, he turned to YouTube to investigate whether other apes engaged in the behavior. He amassed nearly 400 videos showing great apes and other primates engaged in spinning behaviors, including somersaulting, rolling down hills, backflipping and pirouetting. But the new paper focuses on clips of apes spinning on ropes or ropelike materials.",
      "Dr. Perlman and Adriano Lameira, a primatologist and evolutionary psychologist at the University of Warwick in England, found 132 instances of rope-spinning across 40 videos involving orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. The videos mostly featured captive apes, but several involved wild mountain gorillas on vines.",
      "The researchers calculated the speed at which the apes spun. Most of the apes, they found, spun at an average rotation velocity of 1.43 revolutions per second \u2014 a speed rivaling professionally trained human dancers and aerialists. The longest spin session lasted 28 revolutions, and the fastest \u2014 achieved by a bonobo \u2014 clocked in at a brain-scrambling four revolutions per second.",
      "The researchers observed that the longer an ape spun, the more likely it was to show signs of dizziness, such as letting go of the rope and immediately sitting or lying down. Apes tended to repeat the process of spinning and stopping, engaging in an average of three bouts of spinning per session.",
      "The animals also often made \u201cplay faces\u201d while spinning, Dr. Perlman said, implying that they were most likely having fun rather than only seeking a way to relieve themselves of boredom in captivity.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the experience they enjoy,\u201d Dr. Perlman said.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who was not involved in the research, concurred. Based on her observations in the field, she said, \u201cwild apes love to spin.\u201d",
      "Apes and some other animals are known to engage in other activities that can scramble the senses, including consuming fermented fruits containing ",
      " and ingesting naturally occurring ",
      ". Whether this is done on purpose or by accident is debated, Dr. Perlman said. But studies such as this one can begin to provide data needed to explore behaviors that may be evolutionary precursors to the human desire to experience altered mental states.",
      "Dr. Perlman is planning a larger study that will analyze hundreds of additional videos of nonhuman primates spinning. He has also started collecting evidence of other species, including ",
      " and ",
      ", that appear to enjoy activities that may make them dizzy.",
      "Marc Bekoff, an emeritus behavioral ecologist and cognitive ethologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who was not involved in the study, said researching such behavior was valuable \u201cbecause there\u2019s no a priori reason to think we\u2019re the only animals who engage in behaviors that intentionally produce altered states of consciousness.\u201d He added, \u201cSystematic research will help us learn more about the taxonomy of getting high and not run around thinking we\u2019re all that unique.\u201d"

      "Moths and other insects are drawn to lights at night as reliably as planets orbit stars.",
      "Entomologists have long exploited this fact by setting out light traps whenever they want to collect insects. Poets have reached for the image of a moth drawn to flame to signify self-destructive behavior in works ranging from \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d",
      "to the Hindu epic the Bhagavad Gita",
      "Ecologists, more recently, ",
      " that the lure of artificial lights across Earth\u2019s nighttime surface may partially explain why insects are in global decline.",
      "But, despite all this, scientists still didn\u2019t know why.",
      "\u201cA lot of entomologists get asked this all the time,\u201d Avalon Owens, a biologist at Harvard, said.",
      "One prevailing theory, popular but flawed, she said, is that flying insects confuse our porch lights for the moon or another celestial body, and their sense of navigation gets scrambled. Another idea is that lights at night look like glimpses of daylight through a thicket of vegetation, prompting insects to try to \u201cescape\u201d by making a beeline toward what they think is open space.",
      "Now, though, ",
      " has the entomology world abuzz. A team led by biologists Samuel Fabian at Imperial College London and Yash Sondhi at Florida International University argue that when many insects see a bright light at night, they believe they\u2019ve found the direction of the sky and attempt to orient themselves along an up-and-down axis. That instinct prompts them to roll their backs toward the light, mistakenly in cases when the source of illumination is on the ground or mounted horizontally, causing them to go into endless, banking turns like a tiny airplane or to crash-land.",
      "The findings were published in a paper that was uploaded to the bioRxiv server but has yet to be peer-reviewed.",
      "In the daytime, entomologists knew, such directional instincts help flying insects stay level by keeping their backs pointed toward sunlight, even during aerial maneuvers. The new analysis, though, shows that lights at night appear to hijack this instinct.",
      "To arrive at this conclusion, the scientists took high-speed, lowlight video of dragonflies, butterflies and moths flying around light bulbs both in the lab and in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. Sometimes the insects would start making circular loops like an orbiting moon. Other times the insects would pass the bulbs, then tilt upward into a stall. Or they would fly above the bulbs, then flip themselves upside down and nose-dive toward the ground.",
      "In each case, though, the slowed-down footage showed that the insects always tried to keep their backs aimed toward the light, a result the team confirmed by gluing little motion trackers on the insects. In turn, the team found through computerized flight simulations that those inadvertent roll maneuvers could explain the bugs\u2019 looping, trapped flight trajectories.",
      "\u201cThis is the best argument so far for what explains this behavior,\u201d said Tyson Hedrick, an expert in the aerodynamics of insect flight at the University of North Carolina who said he had previously favored the idea that lights interfere with the celestial navigation of insects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of these things that we all sort of think we know about nature,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s getting overturned.\u201d",
      "The new study also offers a hint of how to mitigate the effect, which can kill insects in ways that are poetic \u2014 burning up in flame \u2014 or more sinister, like getting trapped in the web of a spider that has learned artificial lights provide prey. Some insects also simply run out of calories by flying in circles.",
      "The research team found that insects seem least affected when they fly under lights that are projected straight down, as opposed to lights that shine upward or that have been mounted horizontally. This finding dovetails with longstanding advice from researchers to limit light pollution by using downward pointing light fixtures that illuminate only the nearby ground.",
      "Aside from beckoning insects, lights can also interfere with the development of caterpillars, cause fireflies to stop flashing, and shrink the habitat of shyer nocturnal species that venture out only in pure darkness, Dr. Owens said.",
      "\u201cThe most effective way of solving this problem is always going to be turning off the lights,\u201d she said."

      "Then, said Elon Musk, the company\u2019s founder, in an update delivered during a Twitter audio chat on Saturday night, the end of the flight was tenser than it should have been. An automated self-destruct command did not immediately destroy Starship. Instead, 40 seconds passed before the rocket finally exploded.",

      "Twenty-seven seconds after launch, something went wrong with one of the engines \u2014 \u201csome kind of energetic event,\u201d Mr. Musk said \u2014 and that damaged several other nearby engines.",
      "\u201cThe rocket kept going, though,\u201d Mr. Musk said. It was 85 seconds into the flight \u201cwhere things really hit the fan,\u201d Mr. Musk said, when the rocket lost its ability to steer its direction by pointing the engine nozzles.",
      "From that point, the rocket started flying out of control and continued even after the termination command.",
      "\u201cIt took way too long to rupture the tanks,\u201d Mr. Musk said of the flight termination system, which is intended to destroy an out-of-control rocket. The delay did demonstrate the resilience of the rocket, which stayed intact as it tumbled.",
      "\u201cThe vehicle\u2019s structural margins appear to be better than we expected,\u201d Mr. Musk said.",
      "For the next launch, more explosives could be added to ensure that \u201cthe rocket explodes immediately if flight termination is necessary,\u201d he said.",
      "The other unexpected surprise was the shattering of concrete beneath the rocket at launch. ",
      "The thrust of 30 engines unexpectedly generated a \u201crock tornado\u201d that scattered debris across hundreds of acres and generated a giant dust cloud.",
      "\u201cBasically a human-made sandstorm,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d",
      "Instead of the rocket\u2019s 33 engines firing directly onto the concrete below the rocket at liftoff, a large water-cooled steel plate will be installed. Mr. Musk said the plate was not ready for last week\u2019s launch.",
      "He said the next rocket and repairs to the launchpad would be ready within six to eight weeks. However, the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates rocket launches, is investigating the events of the first launch and will have to be satisfied with SpaceX\u2019s adjustments and improvements before allowing another Starship flight.",
      "The next launch would attempt to accomplish the goals of the first mission \u2014 for the Starship vehicle to successfully detach from the booster and reach space before circling most of the planet and landing in the waters off Hawaii.",
      "Mr. Musk did not promise full success on the second try. He said he expected four or five more Starship launches this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably got an 80 percent probability of reaching orbit this year,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tempt fate, but I think close to 100 percent chance of reaching orbit within 12 months.\u201d",
      "Mr. Musk said SpaceX was spending \u201c$2 billion-ish\u201d on Starship this year and would not need additional investments for development of the rocket.",
      "One of the key uses of Starship will be as the lunar lander during NASA\u2019s Artemis III mission, which is to take astronauts to the moon\u2019s surface near the south pole. Mr. Musk confidently asserted that Starship would be ready before other components like the Space Launch System rocket being built by NASA. \u201cWe will not be a limiting factor at all,\u201d he said.",
      "He also emphasized the technical challenges that SpaceX is attempting to overcome in producing a giant spacecraft that can be rapidly reflown repeatedly, something more like a jetliner.",

It could help scientists answer a wide variety of questions about other animals, such as when and how they evolved and the biological basis for some of their unusual talents.",
      "\u201cWhat amazingly cool things can those species do that humans can\u2019t do?\u201d said Elinor Karlsson, a geneticist at UMass Chan Medical School and the Broad Institute and a co-leader of what is known as the ",
      ". \u201cWe always like to think of humans as being the most special species. But it turns out that we\u2019re really quite boring in many ways.\u201d",
      "The Zoonomia data set has limitations. It contains just one genome per species (with the exception of the domestic dog, which was sequenced twice), and thousands of mammals are missing.",
      "But in a new package of papers, published in Science on Thursday, the Zoonomia team showcased the power of this kind of multispecies data. And it\u2019s just the beginning.",
      "\u201cSequencing a lot of genomes is not trivial,\u201d said Michael G. Campana, a computational genomics scientist at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, who was not part of the project. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important is actually making use of these data.\u201d",
      "Here are some of the things that Zoonomia scientists are already doing with it:",
      "To look for the underpinnings of exceptional animal talents, the scientists sought genetic sequences that had evolved unusually quickly in species that shared a certain trait, such as the ability to hibernate.",
      "In ",
      ", the researchers focused on deep hibernators, such as the fat-tailed dwarf lemur and the greater mouse-eared bat, which can maintain low body temperatures for days or weeks at a time. The researchers found evidence of \u201caccelerated evolution\u201d in a variety of genes, including one that is known to help protect cells from temperature-related stress and another that inhibits a cellular pathway related to aging.",
      "\u201cLots of hibernating species also have exceptional longevity,\u201d Dr. Karlsson said, leading her to wonder: Do the changes in that gene contribute to their long lives?",
      "The researchers also explored the mammalian sense of smell. Animals have a large assortment of different olfactory receptors, each capable of binding to certain odor-causing molecules; species with more olfactory receptor genes generally have keener senses of smell.",
      "When the Zoonomia team tallied the number of these genes in each species, the African savanna elephant took the top spot, with 4,199. The nine-banded armadillo and Hoffmann\u2019s two-toed sloth followed, while the Central American agouti came in fourth.",
      "The agouti \u201cturns out to have one of the best olfactory repertoires of any mammal, for totally unknown reasons,\u201d Dr. Karlsson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of how much diversity there is out there that we don\u2019t know anything about.\u201d (Dogs, she noted, did not prove to be \u201cparticularly special\u201d in this regard.)",
      "On the other hand, cetaceans \u2014 a group that includes dolphins and whales \u2014 have a notably small number of olfactory receptor genes, which makes sense given their watery habitats. \u201cThey communicate in other ways,\u201d said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and Uppsala University and the other leader of the Zoonomia Project.",
      "Species with more olfactory receptor genes also tended to have more olfactory turbinals, bony structures in the nasal cavity that aid olfaction. The results suggest that \u201cif certain traits are important, they evolve in multiple ways,\u201d Dr. Lindblad-Toh said.",
      "She added, \u201cI think that one of the important things with our data set is that it generates the genome sequencing for so many different species that people can start looking at their favorite characteristics.\u201d",
      "In February 1925, in the midst of a diphtheria outbreak, a relay of sled dog teams delivered an emergency supply of antitoxin to Nome, Alaska, which had been isolated by snow. Balto, one of the dogs that ran the final leg of the relay, became famous; when he died some years later, his taxidermied body was put on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "A team of Zoonomia researchers has now used a small piece of that taxidermied tissue to ",
      " and his canine contemporaries. \u201cWe saw this as a little challenge,\u201d said Kathleen Morrill, an author of the Balto paper, who performed the research as a graduate student at UMass Chan Medical School and is now a senior scientist at Colossal Biosciences. \u201cHere is this one individual, really famed. We don\u2019t know a lot about his biology. What can we say about his genome?\u201d",
      "Balto, they found, was genetically \u201chealthier\u201d than modern purebred dogs, with more inherited genetic variation and fewer potentially harmful mutations. That finding likely stems from the fact that sled dogs are typically bred for physical performance and may be a mixture of breeds.",
      "Balto also had an assortment of genetic variants that were not present in wolves and were rare or missing in modern purebred dogs, the researchers found. Many variants were in genes involved in tissue development and may have affected a variety of traits important for sled dogs, such as skin thickness and joint formation. Balto had two copies of these variants, one inherited from each parent, which means they were probably at least somewhat common in other Alaskan sled dogs at the time.",
      "\u201cWe get this much clearer picture of what he was like and what his population would have looked like,\u201d said Katie Moon, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an author of the paper. \u201cAnd that picture is of really well-adapted working sled dogs.\u201d",
      "Scientists have long debated precisely how and when today\u2019s diverse assortment of mammals came into being. Did the mammalian family tree branch out only after the extinction of the dinosaurs, some 66 million years ago? Or did the process largely take place before the catastrophe?",
      "A ",
      " suggests that the answer is both. Mammals first began to diversify",
      "about 102 million years ago, when Earth\u2019s continents were fragmenting and sea levels began rising. \u201cThis isolated the predecessors of the modern lineages on different land masses,\u201d said William Murphy, an evolutionary geneticist at Texas A&M University and an author of the paper.",
      "But another burst of diversification came after the extinction of the dinosaurs, the researchers found, when the emergence of new land and the disappearance of the reigning reptiles provided mammals with new habitats, resources and opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really landmark paper,\u201d said Scott Edwards, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, who was not involved in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the largest of its kind in terms of trying to put mammals on a time scale.\u201d",
      "The Zoonomia package more broadly is \u201ca monumental set of work,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really set the standard for our understanding of mammal evolution going forward.\u201d",
      "Mammals generally inherit two copies of most genetic sequences, one from each parent. Determining how closely these sequences match can provide insight into the size of past animal populations; long stretches of matching DNA can be a sign of inbreeding, for instance.",

The results suggested that the killer whale might be at highest risk.",
      "The approach could provide a quick way to prioritize species for more thorough, resource-intensive risk assessments, said Beth Shapiro, a paleogeneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an author of the study. \u201cIt could be a relatively straightforward way to do conservation triage,\u201d she said."

    "name": "This Robot Can Paint. But Is It Art?",
    "author": "Oliver Whang",

    "body": [
      "One day recently, on a table in Jean Oh\u2019s lab in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, a robot arm was busy at a canvas. Slowly, as if the air were viscous, it dipped a brush into a pool of light gray paint on a palette, swung around and stroked the canvas, leaving an inch-long mark amid a cluster of other brushstrokes. Then it pulled back and paused, as if to assess its work.",
      "The strokes, mostly different shades of gray, suggested something abstract \u2014 an anthill, maybe. Dr. Oh, the head of the roBot Intelligence Group at Carnegie Mellon University, dressed in a sweatshirt bearing the words \u201cThere Are Artists Among Us,\u201d looked on with approval. Her doctoral student, Peter Schaldenbrand, stood alongside.",
      "Dr. Oh\u2019s work, which includes robot vision and topics in autonomous aviation, often touches on what is known as the sim-to-real gap: how machines trained in a simulated environment can act in the real world. In recent years, Mr. Schaldenbrand has led an effort to bridge the sim-to-real gap between sophisticated image-generation programs like Stable Diffusion and physical works of art like drawings and paintings. This has mainly been manifest in the project known as FRIDA, the latest iteration of which was rhythmically whirring away in a corner of the lab. (FRIDA is an acronym for Framework and Robotics Initiative for Developing Arts, although the researchers chose the acronym, inspired by Frida Kahlo, before deciding what it stood for.)",
      "The process of moving from language prompts to pixelated images to brushstrokes can be complicated, as the robot must account for \u201cthe noise of the real world,\u201d Dr. Oh said. But she, Mr. Schaldenbrand and Jim McCann, a roboticist at Carnegie Mellon who also helped develop FRIDA, believe that the research is worth pursuing for two reasons: It could improve the interface between humans and machines, and it could, through art, help connect people to one another.",
      "\u201cThese models are trained based on everybody\u2019s data,\u201d Dr. McCann said, referring to the large language models that power tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E. \u201cAnd so I still think we\u2019re figuring out how projects like this, that use such models, can deliver value back to people.\u201d",
      "The sim-to-real gap provides a surprisingly tricky problem for roboticists and computer engineers. Some artificial intelligence systems can list the steps involved in walking (tighten your quadriceps and flex your tibialas posterior, tilt your weight back and tense your gluteus maximus) and can make a simulated body walk in a virtual world. So it\u2019s tempting to think that these systems could easily make a physical body walk in the real world.",
      "Not so. In the 1980s, the computer scientist Hans Moravec noted that A.I. was good at engaging in complicated reasoning and parsing vast amounts of data but that it was bad at simple physical activities, like picking up a bottle of water. This is known as Moravec\u2019s paradox. (The physical superiority of humans might be explained by our body\u2019s long evolutionary history; the tasks that are simple for us are supported by millions of years of Darwinian experimentation.)",
      "Painting, which often mixes high-concept ideas and basic physical actions, throws the paradox into relief: How do we manage to capture the absurdity of human consciousness with the motions of an arm?",
      "A.I. image-generating tools like Midjourney, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion are trained by feeding neural networks massive databases of images and corresponding text descriptions. The programmed goal is to model the relationships between the meanings of words and the features of images, and to then use these relationships in a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d to create original images that retain the meaning of particular descriptions. (The prompt \u201cA family picnicking in the park\u201d will generate a new image every time it is used; each one will be understandable as a family picnicking in the park.)",
      "But such images exist only in the sim-world of computers, composed of pixels of varying hue and intensity. Leave the simulation and the image stays behind.",
      "To solve this problem, Dr. Oh and her colleagues took FRIDA\u2019s physicality into account. Taped to a wall in their lab is a piece of paper with 130 different brushstrokes in black: curlicues and lines, some long and straight, some little more than dots. The marks represent the range of the robot\u2019s motion, and they were programmed into its diffusion model.",
      "We take pictures of the brushstrokes, model that interaction, and then get a really accurate simulation of brushstrokes grounded in what the robot can actually do",
      "Mr. Schaldenbrand said. When prompted, the model would create an image of a frog ballerina in pixels, but only in configurations that were possible for the robot to paint using those 130 brushstrokes.",
      "The researchers also developed a way for the robot to occasionally step back from its painting, to gauge how close it was to the goal it had generated in pixels, and to then revise that pixelated goal. A wayward mark could become the motion of the frog ballerina leaping, or the raised eyebrow of someone in her audience. So, every few dozen brushstrokes, FRIDA pulled away from the canvas, took a photo of its work thus far, paused, and then went back to work.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s how maybe human artists do this,\u201d Dr. Oh said. \u201cAdd some brushstrokes, and then go back and look at the full canvas and replan. We wanted to mimic that process.\u201d A process of artistic self-discovery, in a way, albeit a mechanized, algorithmic and statistical one.",
      "The results of these methods are on display in the lab. Portraits of professors, historical figures, landscapes, cityscapes, that frog ballerina, all in a distinctive, abstract style \u2014 even a self-portrait of the first FRIDA robot. The consistency of the paintings suggests a unified artistic vision, for which Mr. Schaldenbrand, Dr. McCann and Dr. Oh decline to claim credit. They attribute each of the works to FRIDA.",
      "But could FRIDA have an oeuvre without a will, a heart or fingernails? Can a robot be an artist?",
      "Amy LaViers, a computer scientist and dancer who runs the Robotics, Automation and Dance Lab, an independent nonprofit, said that such questions wouldn\u2019t seem so crazy, or scary, if people were open to dissolving the hard distinction between the artist and the medium. Everything \u2014 whether it\u2019s watercolor or A.I. image generators or a desire for expressivity \u2014 is wrapped up in the art. Even something as simple as paint can seem to have a mind of its own, and a painter has to react to the way it glides on the canvas. Dr. LaViers suggested viewing FRIDA as a \u201crobotic paintbrush,\u201d rather than a painting robot.",
      "\u201cThere are things you can do with artificial bodies that humans can\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broadens the palette of human expression.\u201d",
      "Dr. Oh emphasized that humans were still essentially involved in FRIDA\u2019s painting. They prompt the machine and mix the paints, set up the canvas and limit the number of total brushstrokes in each piece. The data sets that FRIDA and other image generators are trained on contain paintings and photographs created by other people. But, Dr. Oh added, the goal was never to make something to compete with human artists. \u201cWe want to promote human creativity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want people to express their thoughts in different ways.\u201d",
      "In the lab, Mr. Schaldenbrand watched as a painting slowly emerged from FRIDA\u2019s deliberate gray brushstrokes: a foggy road, the shapes of cars, taillights. \u201cThis is hard to explain,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give some false notion that there\u2019s a consciousness going on here. But it\u2019s kind of fun sometimes to pretend.\u201d"

      "Earlier this year, astronomers announced that a tiny world beyond Neptune with a diameter about one-third that of Earth\u2019s moon possessed a Saturn-like ring that should not be there. It now turns out that there are two such \u201cimpossible\u201d rings.",
      "\u201cIt was a big surprise,\u201d said Chrystian Luciano Pereira, a doctoral student at the National Observatory in Brazil who led the observations of the world, known as Quaoar. \u201cThis implies that Quaoar is a more complex system than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The new ring, about six miles wide, encircles Quaoar at a distance of about 1,500 miles. The discovery ",
      " in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters.",
      "Scientists still do not fully understand how dust and gas in the early solar system coalesced into moons and planets.",
      "Like the ",
      ", announced by a team of astronomers in February, the second ring lies beyond what is known as the Roche limit. Material orbiting closer than this distance tends to be pulled apart by tidal forces. Thus, a ring within the Roche limit would tend to remain a ring, while a ring of debris outside the Roche limit would usually coalesce into a moon.",
      "For Quaoar, the Roche limit is calculated to be 1,100 miles. The second ring, at a distance of 1,500 miles from the center of Quaoar, is closer than the ring announced in February, which has a radius of about 2,500 miles.",
      "Quaoar (pronounced KWA-wahr, and the name of the creator god for the Indigenous Tongva people who live around Los Angeles) orbits the sun in the ",
      " a region of frozen debris beyond Neptune that includes Pluto.",
      "The ring is not visible in telescope images. Rather, astronomers found it indirectly, when distant stars happened to pass behind Quaoar, blocking the starlight. From 2018 to 2021, Quaoar passed in front of four stars, and astronomers on Earth were able to observe the shadow of the eclipses, also known as stellar occultations.",
      "They also observed some dimming of the starlight before and after the star blinked out, which pointed to the existence of the first ring.",
      "Another occultation occurred on Aug. 9 last year, and astronomers again pointed telescopes, large and small, at Quaoar in hopes of learning more about the ring.",
      "The new observations revealed more details including a dense, narrow core in the ring just a few miles wide, which is surrounded by an envelope of material that is more dispersed. The observations also revealed the second ring.",
      "Another occultation will occur on May 13, visible to telescopes in the United States and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis event involves a bright star and will be useful to constrain the Quaoar shape better, in addition to being a good opportunity to obtain more details about these two remarkable rings,\u201d Mr. Pereira said.",
      "A potential explanation for Quaoar\u2019s distant rings is the presence of a moon, Weywot. The moon may have created gravitational disturbances that prevented the ring\u2019s particles from accreting into additional moons. Both rings occur in locations near what are known as resonances with Weywot, and the resonances may turn out to be more important than the Roche limit for determining whether rings turn into moons or remain as rings."

      "Down the drain is where British archaeologists recently discovered 36 artfully engraved semiprecious stones, in an ancient bathhouse at the site of a Roman fort near Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Carlisle, England. The colorful intaglios \u2014 gems with incised carvings \u2014 likely fell out of signet rings worn by wealthy third-century bathers, and ended up trapped in the stone drains.",
      "The delicate intaglios, fashioned from amethyst, jasper and carnelian, range in diameter from 5 millimeters to 16 millimeters \u2014 bigger than a pencil eraser, smaller than a dime. Some bear images of Apollo, Mars, Bonus Eventus and other Roman deities symbolizing war or good fortune. Others showcase Ceres, the god of fertility, Sol (the sun) and Mercury (commerce). One amethyst depicts Venus holding either a flower or a mirror. A reddish-brown jasper features a satyr seated on rocks beside a pillar.",
      "How and why these stones were lost is a subject of some debate among classicists. After six years of archaeological detective work that has provided a tantalizing glimpse of Roman Britain, Frank Giecco, the technical director of the Carlisle project, believes that he and his team have solved the mystery.",
      "Historically, two kinds of engraved gems were worn mounted on finger rings: intaglios, which have designs cut as a depression into the surface of the gem; and cameos, with designs that project from the background, a raised image in relief.",
      "The tradition of intaglios goes back to the Sumerian period in Mesopotamia, where figures were gouged by hand into softer stone. From about 3400 B.C., stamp seals and cylinder seals were pressed and imprinted into damp clay. These became popular in Minoan and Mycenaean Greece, Persia, Egypt and Rome, where they became objects of fashion; the statesman Cicero observed that people wore portraits of their favorite philosophers on their rings, a tradition that has not survived on today\u2019s QVC Network.",
      "The excavation at the Carlisle Cricket Club began in 2017 and quickly revealed a bathhouse that \u201cwas truly colossal in scale,\u201d Mr. Giecco said.",
      "The bathhouse was built along the river Eden and near the Roman fort of Uxelodunum, also known as Petriana, which was safely situated behind Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the empire\u2019s northern border. Hadrian, the Roman emperor, ordered the wall built in 122 A.D. to ward off Caledonian tribes. At Uxelodunum \u2014 today a thriving suburb \u2014 were stationed the Ala Petriana, a large and elite cavalry regiment. A major civilian settlement \u2014 eventually Luguvalium, or Roman Carlisle \u2014 grew up to the immediate south.",
      "The main building of the bathhouse, constructed around 210 A.D., had sandstone walls three-and-a-half feet thick. The baths were rebuilt in the fourth century and were still in use in the fifth; some parts were subsequently rebuilt in timber and may still have been standing in the 12th century, when the site was quarried for building materials. The region remained strategic. \u201cWe have found evidence of the 1645 and 1745 sieges of Carlisle during the English Civil War and Jacobite Rebellion,\u201d Mr. Giecco said. In the early 20th century the site was turned into tennis courts.",
      "Upon entering the bathhouse in the third century, your first stop was the apodyterium, or changing room, where you removed everything but your bath sandals, needed to protect your feet from the heated floors. Prosperous patrons had slaves to guard their belongings; poorer bathers paid the attendants. Some may have held onto their baubles in the pools to prevent the valuables from being stolen. \u201cBathers knew the risk of gems falling out,\u201d Mr. Giecco said. \u201cBut theft from the lockers was so great that they kept valuables with them regardless.\u201d",
      "If a thief made off with your jewelry, you might call on the gods for justice, by means of a curse tablet: a priest would scrawl a message, sometimes backward or in code, on a slab of lead or other metal, then cast it into the mineral waters. In 1979 and 1980, a large haul of curse tablets was recovered from the hot springs of Aquae Sulis \u2014 now Bath, England \u2014 many of them listing the wrongdoing, the alleged wrongdoers and a suggested punishment. \u201cMay he who carried off Vilbia from me be as liquid as the water,\u201d one curse reads.",
      "The Carlisle gems were found along with more than 700 items, including 105 glass beads, pottery, weapons, coins, clay figures, animal bones, tiles stamped with the imperial mark and some 100 hairpins. Similar discoveries have been made during the excavation of bathhouses in Caesarea, Israel, and in Bath.",
      "The presence of hairpins suggest that the gems\u2019 owners were probably female, Mr. Giecco said. And dips into bathhouse water may have loosened jewelry adhesives, such as birch bark resin, and caused metal settings to expand and contract. In the steamy environment, the Roman elite may have emerged from their leisurely baths unadorned. The stones were likely flushed into the drains when the pools and saunas were cleaned.",
      "\u201cThe bathers may not have even noticed until they got home, because it\u2019s the actual stone falling out of the rings,\u201d Mr. Giecco said."

      "Think of the words whirling around in your head: that tasteless joke you wisely kept to yourself at dinner; your unvoiced impression of your best friend\u2019s new partner. Now imagine that someone could listen in.",
      "On Monday, scientists from the University of Texas, Austin, made another step in that direction. In a study published\u00a0",
      ", the researchers described an A.I. that could translate the private thoughts of human subjects by analyzing fMRI scans,\u00a0which measure the flow of blood to different regions in the brain.",
      "Already, researchers have developed language-decoding methods to ",
      " of people who have lost the ability to speak, and to allow ",
      " while just thinking of writing. But the new language decoder is one of the first to not rely on implants. In the study, it was able to turn a person\u2019s imagined speech into actual speech and, when subjects were shown silent films, it could generate relatively accurate descriptions of what was happening onscreen.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a language stimulus,\u201d said Alexander Huth, a neuroscientist at the university who helped lead the research. \u201cWe\u2019re getting at meaning, something about the idea of what\u2019s happening. And the fact that that\u2019s possible is very exciting.\u201d",
      "The study centered on three participants, who came to Dr. Huth\u2019s lab for 16 hours over several days to listen to \u201cThe Moth\u201d and other narrative podcasts. As they listened, an fMRI scanner recorded the blood oxygenation levels in parts of their brains. The researchers then used a large language model to match patterns in the brain activity to the words and phrases that the participants had heard.",
      "Large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Bard are trained on vast amounts of writing to predict the next word in a sentence or phrase. In the process, the models create maps indicating how words relate to one another. A few years ago, Dr. Huth ",
      " that particular pieces of these maps \u2014 so-called context embeddings, which capture the semantic features, or meanings, of phrases \u2014 could be used to predict how the brain lights up in response to language.",
      "In a basic sense, said Shinji Nishimoto, a neuroscientist at Osaka University who was not involved in the research, \u201cbrain activity is a kind of encrypted signal, and language models provide ways to decipher it.\u201d",
      "In their study, Dr. Huth and his colleagues effectively reversed the process, using another A.I. to translate the participant\u2019s fMRI images into words and phrases. The researchers tested the decoder by having the participants listen to new recordings, then seeing how closely the translation matched the actual transcript.",
      "Almost every word was out of place in the decoded script, but the meaning of the passage was regularly preserved. Essentially, the decoders were paraphrasing.",
      ": \u201cI got up from the air mattress and pressed my face against the glass of the bedroom window expecting to see eyes staring back at me but instead only finding darkness.\u201d",
      " \u201cI just continued to walk up to the window and open the glass I stood on my toes and peered out I didn\u2019t see anything and looked up again I saw nothing.\u201d",
      "While under the fMRI scan, the participants were also asked to silently imagine telling a story; afterward, they repeated the story aloud, for reference. Here, too, the decoding model captured the gist of the unspoken version.",
      ": \u201cLook for a message from my wife saying that she had changed her mind and that she was coming back.\u201d",
      ": \u201cTo see her for some reason I thought she would come to me and say she misses me.\u201d",
      "Finally the subjects watched a brief, silent animated movie, again while undergoing an fMRI scan. By analyzing their brain activity, the language model could decode a rough synopsis of what they were viewing \u2014 maybe their internal description of what they were viewing.",
      "The result suggests that the A.I. decoder was capturing not just words but also meaning. \u201cLanguage perception is an externally driven process, while imagination is an active internal process,\u201d Dr. Nishimoto said. \u201cAnd the authors showed that the brain uses common representations across these processes.\u201d",
      "Greta Tuckute, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research, said that was \u201cthe high-level question.\u201d",
      "\u201cCan we decode meaning from the brain?\u201d she continued. \u201cIn some ways they show that, yes, we can.\u201d",
      "This language-decoding method had limitations, Dr. Huth and his colleagues noted. For one, fMRI scanners are bulky and expensive. Moreover, training the model is a long, tedious process, and to be effective it must be done on individuals. When the researchers tried to use a decoder trained on one person to read the brain activity of another, it failed, suggesting that every brain has unique ways of representing meaning.",
      "Participants were also able to shield their internal monologues, throwing off the decoder by thinking of other things. A.I. might be able to read our minds, but for now it will have to read them one at a time, and with our permission."

Small stars, like red dwarfs, may shine for trillions of years, whereas the most massive stars explode just a few million years after their births. As stars like the sun start to die after billions of years, they transform into a class called red giants that expand hundreds of times in size, consuming anything within their advancing borders.",
      "Signs of engulfment events are littered across the Milky Way. The light of some stars is polluted with the chemical signatures of planets, suggesting that whole worlds are being digested before our eyes. Scientists have also spotted hundreds of planets with small orbits that are doomed to fall within the radius of red giants in the future.",
      "But while stars clearly consume the occasional planet, capturing this moment",
      "is challenging because the light sparked by these events is faint and ephemeral. In fact, Dr. De was using the Zwicky Transient Facility, a camera on a telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California, in May 2020 to look for something completely different \u2014 merging stars, called red novas. It was in those observations that he stumbled across a curious burst of visible light.",
      "What unfolded was like a \u201cdetective story,\u201d Dr. De said. To identify the burst, his team obtained visible-light observations of the source captured in November 2020 by the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Those images revealed a star chilling at about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, about 10 times colder than the searing temperatures expected from red novas.",
      "Puzzled, Dr. De and his colleagues observed the star again, this time in infrared light, using another camera at the Palomar Observatory and NASA\u2019s NEOWISE space telescope. The system turned out to be brilliant in infrared, a band of the light spectrum that is ideal for spotting faint objects that don\u2019t emit much energy. It dawned on the researchers that they were most likely watching a star gulping down a planet in real time.",
      "\u201cMy first reaction was disbelief,\u201d Dr. De said. \u201cWe see the before and the after\u201d of planetary engulfment, he added, but \u201cthese observations give us the first glimpse into how that process plays out.\u201d",
      "The initial burst detected by the Zwicky observatory, which lasted 10 days, occurred at the moment that a dying star at last fully enveloped a gas planet no more than 10 times the mass of Jupiter. For more than a year before its luminous demise, the planet skimmed the outskirts of the star, pulling off chunks of its atmosphere, which explains why the researchers saw cool gas and dust hanging around the system. After the burst, the star eerily glowed for about six months as it swallowed the remains of the planet.",
      "Lorenzo Spina, an astrophysicist at the Astronomical Observatory of Padua in Italy who studies planetary engulfment, called the team\u2019s conclusions \u201cvery solid\u201d and described the discovery as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a very important missing piece of the entire story,\u201d Dr. Spina said. \u201cNow, we are going to have a more complete understanding of this entire process.\u201d",
      "Such incredible events can shed light on a host of juicy mysteries, including the odds that life might exist elsewhere in the universe. Starlight that contains chemical hints of planetary morsels can be mined for clues about the interior composition of worlds in other systems. Building an inventory of these ingredients can help to estimate the number of star systems with the right materials to support habitable environments.",
      "Now that scientists have seen a real example of planetary engulfment, they can search the skies for similar patterns that fit the blueprint. The new observations also provide a grisly sneak peek of the literal end of the world. When the sun enters its red-giant phase, our familiar home planet is likely to die within its infernal embrace.",
      "\u201cFinding an event like this really puts all of the theories that have been out there to the most stringent tests possible,\u201d Dr. De said. \u201cIt really opens up this entire new field of research.\u201d"

      "The End is coming, in maybe 100 billion years. Is it too soon to start freaking out?",
      "\u201cThere will be a last sentient being, there will be a last thought,\u201d declared Janna Levin, a cosmologist at Barnard College, near the end of \u201cA Trip to Infinity,\u201d a new Neflix documentary directed by Jonathan Halperin and Drew Takahashi.",
      "When I heard that statement during a showing of the film recently, it broke my heart. It was the saddest, loneliest idea I had ever contemplated. I thought I was aware and knowledgeable about our shared cosmic predicament \u2014 namely, that if what we think we know about physics and cosmology is true, life and intelligence are doomed. I thought I had made some kind of intellectual peace with that.",
      "But this was an angle that I hadn\u2019t thought of before. At some point in the future there will be somewhere in the universe where there will be a last sentient being. And a last thought. And that last word, no matter how profound or mundane, will vanish into silence along with the memory of Einstein and Elvis, Jesus, Buddha, Aretha and Eve, while the remaining bits of the physical universe go on sailing apart for billions upon billions upon billions of lonely, silent years.",
      "Will that last thought be a profound pearl of wisdom? An expletive?",
      "How did we humans get into this fix? The universe as we know it originated in a fiery burst 13.8 billion years ago and has been flying apart ever since. Astronomers argued for decades about whether it would go on expanding forever or someday collapse again into a \u201cbig crunch.\u201d",
      "All that changed in 1998 when astronomers discovered that the cosmic expansion was speeding up, boosted by an anti-gravitational force that is part of the fabric of spacetime. The bigger the universe gets, the harder this \u201cdark energy\u201d pushes it apart. This new force bears a striking resemblance to the cosmological constant, a cosmic repulsion Einstein had proposed as a fudge factor in his equations as a way of explaining why the universe did not collapse, but later rejected as a blunder.",
      "But the cosmological constant ",
      ". And now it threatens to wreck physics and the universe.",
      "In the end, if this dark energy prevails, distant galaxies will eventually be speeding away so fast that we can\u2019t see them anymore. The more time goes on, the less we will know about the universe. The stars will die and not be reborn. It will be like living inside an inside-out black hole, sucking matter, energy and information over the horizon, never to return.",
      "Worse, because thinking takes energy, eventually there will not be enough energy in the universe to hold a thought. In the end there will only be subatomic particles dancing intergalactic distances away from each other in a dark silence, trillions upon trillions of years after there was any light or life in the universe. And then, more uncountable trillions of eons to come, until there is finally no way to count the years, as Brian Greene, the popular Columbia University theorist and author, so elegantly and devastatingly described it in his recent book, \u201cUntil the End of Time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard not to want to scream at our own insignificance in all of this. If this is, in fact, what the universe will come to. The universe as we know it is now 14 billion years old, which seems like a long time but is only an infinitesimal sliver of the trillions and quadrillions of years of darkness to come. It will mean that everything interesting in our universe happened in a brief flash, at the very beginning. A promising start, and then an eternal abyss. The finality and futility of it all!",
      "In short, a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. What do we do with a universe like this?",
      "You may point out that it is way too soon to be prescribing a future for the universe. New discoveries in physics could provide an escape hatch. Maybe dark energy will not be constant; maybe it will turn around and recompress the universe. In an email, Michael Turner, the cosmologist emeritus formerly at the University of Chicago who coined the term dark energy, referring to the Greek letter symbolizing Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant said, \u201cLambda would be the most uninteresting answer to the dark energy puzzle!\u201d",
      "But for now, that is ",
      ".",
      "Our goose will be cooked a billion or so years from now, when the Sun boils away the oceans. A few billion years later the Sun itself will die, burning Earth and anything that remains of us to a crisp.",
      "There is no escaping to space. The galaxies themselves will collapse into black holes in about 10^30 years.",
      "And black holes will finally release all that they have imprisoned as a thin spray of particles and radiation, to be scattered into the prevailing wind of dark energy whisking them apart.",
      "In some variations on the story, known as the Big Rip, dark energy could eventually grow strong enough to tear apart the tombstones that mark your grave.",
      "And so, just as there was a first living creature somewhere, sometime, to emerge from the splendid blaze of the Big Bang, there will be a last creature to die, a last thought. A last sentient being, as Dr. Levin pointed out.",
      "That idea is what stopped me short. It had never occurred to me that some individual being would have the last word on existence, the last chance to curse or be grateful. Part of the pain is that nobody will know who, or what, had the last word, or what was thought or said. Somehow that notion made cosmic extinction more personal, and I wondered what it would be like.",
      "Maybe as all the energy dwindles away over the horizon it will be like falling asleep. Or like Einstein mumbling his last words in German to a nurse who didn\u2019t know the language. Or the computer at the end of time in Isaac Asimov\u2019s classic story ",
      " finally figuring out the secret of the universe and declaring, \u201cLet there be light.\u201d Might it be some blazing realization about the nature of string theory or the final secret about black holes? I hate to miss out on it.",
      "I\u2019d like to think my last thought would be one of love or gratitude or awe or about the face of a loved one, but I worry it would be an expletive.",
      "Wiser people than me ask, when I go on about this, why I don\u2019t whine about the billions of years that passed before I was born? Perhaps it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know what I was missing, whereas now I\u2019ve had a lifetime to imagine what I\u2019ll miss.",
      "If that worries you, here is an encouraging metaphor straight from Einstein\u2019s equations: When you are inside a black hole, light pours in from the outside universe, which seems to speed up while you appear to be frozen. In principle, you could see the whole future history of the galaxy or even the whole universe speed past you as you fall toward the center, the singularity where space and time stop, and you die.",
      "Maybe death could be like that, a revelation of all of the past and future.",
      "In a sense, when we die the future dies too.",
      "Rather than whine about the end of time, most of the physicists and astronomers I talk to say the notion is a relief. The death of the future frees them to concentrate on the magic of the moment.",
      "The late, great astrophysicist, philosopher and black hole evangelist John Archibald Wheeler, of Princeton, used to say that the past and the future are fiction, that they only exist in the artifacts and the imaginations of the present.",
      "According to that point of view, the universe ends with me, and so in a sense I do have the final word.",
      "\u201cNothing lasts forever\u201d is a maxim that applies to the stock market and the stars as well as to our lives and Buddhist sand paintings. A whiff of eternity can illuminate an entire lifetime, perhaps even mine.",
      "No matter what happens in the endless eons to come, at least we were here for the party, for the brief shining sliver of eternity when the universe teemed with life and light.",
      "We\u2019ll always have the Milky Way."

      "If the boom in new battery factories, wind and solar farms, electric vehicle plants and other investments is sustained, the law could prove even more effective than administration officials had hoped at reducing the fossil fuel emissions that are dangerously heating the planet.",
      "But all that new economic activity centered around green technology is also driving up costs for taxpayers, who are subsidizing the investments.",
      "When Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act last August, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law\u2019s climate and clean energy tax credits would cost roughly ",
      ". But the budget office\u2019s ",

Mr. Manchin now faces a potentially difficult re-election campaign that could pit him against Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican who announced last week he will run for the Senate in 2024.

      "\u201cIt will be a net job creator, for sure,\u201d said Brian Deese, Mr. Biden\u2019s former National Economic Council director, who stepped down in February.

Utilities can earn credits by generating electricity from wind or solar farms. And businesses are eligible for tax incentives if they manufacture batteries or solar panels in the United States.",

      "\u201cWhether or not you agree with the policy goals here, I do think we need to be honest about how much this is going to cost,\u201d Ms. McDaniel said. \u201cBecause the budget is only so big, and there are always going to be trade-offs to spending.\u201d",

      "Consider, for instance, the provision in the bill that provides a $7,500 tax credit for consumers to buy electric vehicles. In theory, the full credit is available only to electric cars that are assembled in North America and get most of their battery components and critical minerals from either the\u00a0United States or trade allies. But that is a moving target; as automakers and battery manufacturers open new factories in the United States, more cars would qualify.",
      "At the same time, the Treasury Department ",
      " in the tax rules in ways that could expand eligibility for certain cars, drawing criticism from Mr. Manchin, who has pushed for more restrictive rules.",
      "\u201cWhen the law originally passed, I didn\u2019t think any vehicles would qualify for the full credit right off the bat,\u201d said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, an electric vehicle research group. \u201cBut there are already at least 10 that do, and we\u2019re seeing that automakers can be very creative in setting up their supply chains when they have incentive to do so.\u201d",
      "One analysis from Goldman Sachs suggested that electric vehicle provision alone could cost $379 billion more over the next decade than the budget office estimated.",
      "On the flip side, it is also possible that the law ends up being far less potent than many experts are now assuming. Even with tax credits,\u00a0many car buyers might be reluctant to purchase electric vehicles because of a lack of reliable charging stations. Developers of large-scale solar and wind farms could face increasing opposition in communities where they want to build. And, while companies have announced plans for more than $150 billion in clean energy projects so far, some of those investments depend on the Treasury Department to enact favorable rules around certain tax provisions that have yet to be clarified, Mr. Grumet said.",
      "Because of all those variables, the law\u2019s true price tag may not be known for years.",
      "\u201cSo much depends on questions like: Can the permitting process for clean energy projects become easier to navigate? Will there be enough skilled workers and critical minerals available?\u201d said Melissa Lott, research director for the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cThe law is almost certainly going to move the needle on emissions, but the degree to which it does so is still unclear.\u201d"

      "Ms. Gamble, 41, is a journalist based in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. She has interviewed major world figures including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, and she has worked for CNBC for more than a decade in the Middle East and London, where she met Mr. Shell.",

      "Ms. Gamble and Mr. Shell eventually did begin a sexual relationship, according to the complaint, after it became clear to her that rebutting his advances would probably damage her career. The complaint said that Mr. Shell continued to use his position of power at NBCUniversal to pressure her for sex while pursuing her in London, New York and Dubai.",
      "Mr. Shell pursued Ms. Gamble on and off over a period of years over text and email, according to two people familiar with their correspondence, and Ms. Gamble turned over those messages to the company as part of its investigation.",
      "Elsewhere in the complaint, Ms. Gamble alleged specific instances of discrimination and inappropriate behavior toward numerous women at CNBC. In one instance, Ms. Gamble describes a manager calling her a vulgar epithet for women in front of her co-workers for raising concerns about bullying behavior from another journalist. In another, she alleges a co-worker berated her for ending an interview early, using coarse language, and snapping at her for rewriting headlines that she had to read on air.",
      "Ms. Gamble filed the complaint after CNBC did not renew her contract this year. A person familiar with Ms. Gamble\u2019s thinking said that her decision to file the complaint, which she had considered for years, was also based on frustration with what she viewed as a toxic culture of harassment and bullying at CNBC.

      "John Casey, the president of CNBC International, told her in February that the network would not offer her a contract for a period longer than a month, according to the complaint. He told her that she had a behavioral problem and accused her of bullying other journalists at CNBC.",
      "Ms. Gamble denied those accusations, according to her complaint. She said in her complaint that Mr. Casey had used the allegations of bullying to justify the decision not to renew her contract, adding that such claims would not have been leveled against a male peer.",
      "Tension existed between Ms. Gamble and CNBC managers before the network\u2019s decision not to renew her contract. In June, the network told her that it was investigating a complaint made against her and a manager at CNBC who had supervised her.",
      "Among other things, CNBC investigated whether she had used a romantic relationship with Tom Barrack, a private equity investor, to secure an interview with Jared Kushner, according to Ms. Gamble\u2019s complaint. The investigation concluded that Ms. Gamble did have a relationship with Mr. Barrack, but determined the relationship was disclosed and there was no evidence of impropriety, according to her complaint. Mr. Barrack was unmarried at the time of his relationship with Ms. Gamble, according to a person familiar with the relationship.",
      "The investigation into Ms. Gamble also found that she had made inappropriate comments about some colleagues in the past, and that she had not always strictly complied with CNBC\u2019s travel and expense policy."

      "The contemporary wind power industry, which has spawned hundreds of thousands of spinning rotors generating electricity without putting greenhouse gases into the air, was to a great extent born in a notoriously windy region of Denmark called Jutland.",
      "It was here almost 50 years ago, after the 1973 oil embargo cut energy supplies to much of the West, that inventors and machinists began comparing notes about ways to harness the wind that sweeps across this flat expanse separating the North Sea from the islands that form the rest of Denmark. And while countless people have played a role in refining the machines that stud coastlines, plains and mountain ridges, perhaps no one has had more influence than a Jutlander named Henrik Stiesdal.",
      "As a young man of 21, he built a rudimentary machine to generate electricity ",
      ". He was later co-designer of an innovative three-bladed turbine that set the stage for what has become a multibillion-dollar global industry. His inventions have led to about a thousand patents, and Mr. Stiesdal is widely seen as a pioneer in this very Danish field.",
      "At age 66, he is not done. After decades working for what became some of the giant companies in wind energy, Mr. Stiesdal is putting his ideas into a start-up that bears his name, pursuing innovative ways to offer clean and affordable energy and tackle climate change.",
      "At a factory in Give, a small town near the middle of Jutland, workers with welding tools are gearing up to produce massive tetrahedral structures, designed by Mr. Stiesdal, that will serve as bases for floating wind turbines. Made of tubes and resembling huge Lego toys, they will sit partly submerged, covering an area of roughly two American football fields.",
      "Nearby, engineers are testing a machine that looks like a series of stacks of cafeteria trays. It is a new design for an electrolyzer \u2014 a device that takes water and, from it, derives hydrogen gas, which is drawing increasing attention as a replacement for fossil fuels.",
      "Two hours north is another product under development: an industrial oven that bakes farm waste \u2014 like manure and straw \u2014 so that its carbon content can\u2019t escape into the atmosphere and form carbon dioxide. It is carbon capture in action.",
      "\u201cYou can see that it is not just talk\u201d about climate change, Mr. Stiesdal said. \u201cWe have undertaken to do something.\u201d",
      "A tall, plain-spoken man not afraid to experiment with hydrogen, a potentially explosive gas, in his basement, Mr. Stiesdal is betting that his suite of technologies will contribute to a significant cut in greenhouse gas emissions. He also wants to ensure that Denmark and other Northern Europe countries stay in the forefront as investment in the transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources ramps up.",
      "Mr. Stiesdal is taking the initiative when the renewable-energy industry in Northern Europe is in the doldrums. ",
      ", have struggled because of rising costs and the slow approval of projects. The worry is that Chinese manufacturers, which long ago established dominance in making solar panels, will do the same in wind.",
      "Mr. Stiesdal has raised about $100 million for his company, Stiesdal, tapping a small group of investors. His family owns about 20 percent of the company, which has 125 employees. To keep costs down and to extend his reach, he plans to mostly license the new products, letting others build them.",
      "Investors say they like Mr. Stiesdal\u2019s combination of technological smarts and focus on lowering costs. \u201cHe also has a strong business understanding, meaning he can attract money like ours,\u201d said Torben Moger Pedersen, chief executive of PensionDanmark, which manages retirement funds for 800,000 workers and is one of Stiesdal\u2019s largest investors.",
      "Mr. Stiesdal is trying again to find the creative spark that led Jutland and Denmark to play a world-leading role in reducing carbon emissions, mostly through wind, over the last half-century.",
      "In Jutland, in the 1970s, many young Danes were experimenting with generating electricity from wind, partly as a countercultural kick spurred by the high energy costs of the 1973 oil embargo, but also as an alternative to nuclear power, which they scorned.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to go to Jutland and make a greener world,\u201d said Erik Grove-Nielsen, an early maker of wind turbine blades.",
      "Mr. Stiesdal can date his aversion to fossil fuels to a bicycle trip to England when he was 19 and found himself riding for hours through a cloud of smoke spewing from a power plant.",
      "\u201cThat gave me a strong feeling that this is not right,\u201d he said.",
      "In the late 1970s, he and a blacksmith, Karl Erik Jorgensen (who died in 1982), designed a wind turbine for a local company now called Vestas Wind Systems, at the time a maker of cranes. Their machine combined a number of ideas that became known as the \u201cDanish concept.\u201d It had three blades and \u201cair brakes\u201d to keep them from spinning out of control \u2014 a common hazard. They also engineered the device to keep facing directly into the wind, for maximum energy yield.",
      "At the time, Vestas was experimenting with a less efficient two-bladed prototype. The three-bladed machine became a foundation for Vestas, which is now the world-leading manufacturer of turbines, with 14.5 billion euros (nearly $16 billion) in sales in 2022.",
      "After dividing time between college and consulting for Vestas, Mr. Stiesdal joined a second Jutland company that would become a giant in the industry, ",
      ". He led technical breakthroughs, like one-piece casting of blades, that allowed wind turbines to evolve from relatively small structures for farms to towers with blades more than 300 feet long.",
      "\u201cHe established that vision and dream, and then he turned it into reality,\u201d said Steffen Poulsen, who heads design of new turbines at Siemens Gamesa.",
      "Perhaps Mr. Stiesdal\u2019s most lasting advance was leading the industry into the sea, through the construction of the world\u2019s first offshore wind farm in 1991, a relatively modest project in shallow waters near Vindeby, Denmark. ",
      "This innovation has helped nurture in Denmark two of the world\u2019s largest renewable energy developers: the Vindeby wind farm\u2019s owner, Orsted, and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, a private company with \u20ac19 billion under management.",
      "\u201cWe have such a strong ecosystem that I think we will continue to be well positioned,\u201d said Mads Nipper, Orsted\u2019s chief executive.",
      "Since retiring as chief technology officer of Siemens Gamesa, Mr. Stiesdal has looked for new ways to make a mark. One area: floating turbines, ",
      " than traditional wind farms. Although they open up far greater expanses of ocean to wind generation, ",
      ", in part because they are not produced in assembly lines. Mr. Stiesdal aims to change that.",
      "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners has helped finance a prototype of a floating base designed by Mr. Stiesdal that would support a turbine, with an eye to using his design on future projects, including off Eureka in Northern California.",
      "\u201cHenrik is very focused on making sure the floaters can be produced in a smart way,\u201d said Torsten Smed, a co-founder and senior partner at Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The company is making these structures in Jutland for a wind farm planned off Scotland, using robots and other technology to remain competitive despite Denmark\u2019s high labor costs.",
      "Mr. Stiesdal, with researchers at the Technical University of Denmark, is also developing electrolyzers that are intended to cut the high cost of making so-called green hydrogen, which is free of emissions. Climate experts and industrialists say hydrogen is likely to be needed to power heavy industries, such as steel, and perhaps vehicles like airplanes and trucks.",
      "While his electrolyzers are still in the shakedown stage, Mr. Stiesdal has a preliminary agreement with Reliance Industries, an energy giant based in India, to manufacture the devices.",
      "He is also building an enlarged version of his carbon capture machine, SkyClean, which uses heat to turn agricultural waste into what looks like charcoal pellets that can permanently lock up carbon and thus, he says, prevent it from returning to the atmosphere.",
      "Mr. Stiesdal\u2019s company, like many start-ups, is losing money, he said, but he hopes to break even by next year. He thinks he has a good chance of success because the technologies he is nurturing are suited to a small country like Denmark, which has just under six million people.",
      "The products are not especially high tech or labor intensive, he said, but depend on a hands-on approach and a well-educated work force produced by a widely accessible university system.",
      "\u201cIn many ways,\u201d he said, \u201cthey resemble what I did as a pioneer 45 years ago.\u201d"

He foresees new projects propelled by recent federal energy and infrastructure legislation, but rising interest rates are taking a toll in the meantime.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s not what it was,\u201d Mr. Stager said.",

      "A bigger question for the American economy is whether this heralds a broader downturn, since cooling demand for goods usually signifies that consumers are feeling financially strained. \u201cManufacturing is always at the forefront of the recession,\u201d notes Barbara Denham, a senior economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "To understand the current slump, it\u2019s important to dissect the manufacturing moment from which America is emerging.",
      "For example: Those new manufacturing jobs weren\u2019t all for people making steel coils and oak cabinets. The production of consumable items \u2014 including food, beverages, and pharmaceuticals \u2014 represented an outsize portion of the job growth from 2020 through 2022. But it tends to pay less well, requires less training and has fewer unions than heavy manufacturing in airplanes and automobiles. And it can disappear more quickly as demand returns to normal.",

      "The factory construction underway is poised to further reshape the geography of American manufacturing, with the largest increases in investment ",
      ".",
      "All that new building is propelled by several factors. Former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s trade war raised the cost of importing from China and other countries, while the pandemic snarled ports and idled suppliers, hurting manufacturers who depended on far-flung sourcing networks.",
      "In recent months, the war in Ukraine \u2014 for which the United States has furnished more than ",
      " \u2014 has generated more long-term contracts for defense manufacturers, mostly restricted to domestic production.",

But in the past few weeks, he has been busy serving military clients \u2014 because the Defense Department has been getting planes and ships back into fighting shape, as well as refilling ",

      "Finally, over the last two years the passage of three major bills \u2014 the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act \u2014 made available hundreds of billions of dollars for the production of items like semiconductors, solar panels, wind turbines and bridge spans. Private funders have rushed to capitalize on the opportunity, even if much of it is still in the planning stages.",
      "\u201cA lot of manufacturers are reacting to what they see as a lot of long-term structural factors in their industry,\u201d said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at the Economic Innovation Group, an entrepreneurship-focused think tank. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing more demand for domestic production long term. That\u2019s a bet on the future. It\u2019s going to take a while to really translate to employment.\u201d",

      "A text message sent by Tucker Carlson that set off a panic at the highest levels of Fox on the eve of its billion-dollar defamation trial showed its most popular host sharing his private, inflammatory views about violence and race.",
      "The discovery of the message contributed to a chain of events that ultimately led to Mr. Carlson\u2019s firing.",
      "In the message, sent to one of his producers in the hours after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Mr. Carlson described how he had recently watched a video of a group of men \u2014 Trump supporters, he said \u2014 violently attacking \u201can Antifa kid.\u201d",
      "It was \u201cthree against one, at least,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And then he expressed a sense of dismay that the attackers, like him, were white.",
      "\u201cJumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not how white men fight,\u201d he said. But he said he found himself for a moment wanting the group to kill the person he had described as the Antifa kid.",
      "For years, Mr. Carlson espoused views on his show that ",
      ". But the text message revealed more about his views on racial superiority. ",
      "The text alarmed the Fox board, which saw the message a day before Fox was set to defend itself against Dominion Voting Systems before a jury. The board grew concerned that the message could become public at trial when Mr. Carlson was on the stand, creating a sensational and damaging moment that would raise broader questions about the company.",
      "The day after the discovery, the board told Fox executives it was bringing in an outside law firm to conduct an investigation into Mr. Carlson\u2019s conduct.",
      "The text message added to a growing number of internal issues involving Mr. Carlson that led the company\u2019s leadership to conclude he was more of a problem than an asset and had to go, according to several people with knowledge of the decision. In other messages he had referred to women \u2014 including a senior Fox executive \u2014 in crude and misogynistic terms. The message about the fight also played a role in the company\u2019s decision to settle with Dominion for $787.5 million, the highest known payout in a defamation case.",
      "A representative for Mr. Carlson said he had no comment.",
      "The text is part of redacted court filings and its contents were previously unreported. The contents of the text were disclosed in interviews with several people close to the defamation lawsuit against Fox. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a message that is protected by a court order. In public filings, it remains hidden behind a block of black text.",
      "Mr. Carlson\u2019s messages were collected as part of the defamation lawsuit filed against Fox by Dominion, which accused the network of knowingly airing falsehoods about election fraud. Many of the messages shared in the case, including those among Fox executives and hosts, were released publicly. But others, like the one between Mr. Carlson and one of his producers in the hours after Jan. 6, 2021, remain redacted.",
      "In that text, Mr. Carlson described his own emotions as he watched the video of the violent clash, which he said took place on the streets of Washington. Mr. Carlson did not describe the race of the man being attacked.",
      "\u201cI found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they\u2019d hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThen somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off: this isn\u2019t good for me. I\u2019m becoming something I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d",
      "After all, he wrote, \u201cSomebody probably loves this kid, and would be crushed if he was killed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t care about those things, if I reduce people to their politics, how am I better than he is?\u201d he wrote.",
      "The text message came to the attention of Fox\u2019s board of directors and even some senior executives only last month, on the Sunday before the trial was set to begin, according to two people with knowledge of Fox\u2019s internal deliberations. At the time, Fox\u2019s negotiators were entering discussions about an out-of-court settlement ahead of the swearing in of what was shaping up to be a diverse jury.",
      "The next day, the board told Fox\u2019s leadership about its plan to have the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz investigate Mr. Carlson. That disclosure set up the possibility that there could be a continuing investigation into what was behind Mr. Carlson\u2019s messages at the same time as a trial, and as he was serving as its top host in prime time.",
      "Fox has not commented about Mr. Carlson\u2019s ouster last week beyond an initial statement announcing that they \u201cagreed to part ways\u201d and thanking \u201chim for his service.\u201d It did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday on the contents of Mr. Carlson\u2019s redacted message.",
      "It remains unclear how the text escaped more notice earlier, given that the Fox legal team was aware of it and other offensive texts written by Mr. Carlson. Fox\u2019s lawyers had produced the text as part of the discovery process and were involved in the redactions. Mr. Carlson had even been asked about it during a deposition, according to several people who have read the unredacted transcripts of his deposition. ",
      "It was not guaranteed that the text would have been revealed in open court. Dominion\u2019s lawyers had still not decided whether they would introduce the text in front of the jury, according to people with knowledge of their plans. The two sides disagreed on whether the Dominion lawyers could have presented such a redacted message at trial if they had decided to do so, a decision that would have ultimately fallen to the judge. The difference became moot after Fox struck an 11th-hour deal on April 18 to pay Dominion $787.5 million and avoid trial.",
      "How Fox\u2019s executives and board handled the case in the months before the trial was scheduled to begin is expected to be at issue in shareholder lawsuits filed against the company in Delaware.",
      "Though Mr. Carlson\u2019s show, \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d was only a small factor in the Dominion suit, his personal texts were drawing outsize scrutiny. ",
      "The text about the fight came on top of a damaging chain of messages that had been revealed publicly ahead of trial, and that were shocking in their own right. Writing to one of his producers after the assault on the Capitol, Mr. Carlson describes the president he championed on his show as a \u201cdemonic force\u201d and a \u201cdestroyer.\u201d",
      "A recurring theme of his show during the six years that it ran in prime time on Fox News was the displacement of white Americans by people of color. Mr. Carlson often framed topics in the news as part of a larger struggle between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d with immigrants and other marginalized groups steadily and surely taking from whites what had long been theirs: political and cultural power in the United States.",
      "He attacked Black social justice activists and portrayed immigrants from Central America as a blight on the nation. He said in 2018 that immigrants make the country \u201cdirtier.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath of a mass shooting in El Paso at the hands of a gunman who cited white supremacist beliefs in his manifesto, Mr. Carlson declared on his show that white supremacy was \u201cnot a real problem,\u201d likening it to a conspiracy theory.",
      "On Monday, The New York Times and other news organizations urged the judge overseeing the Dominion case to release some of the messages that were redacted."

      "Federal Reserve officials are set to release an interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon, and while investors widely expect policymakers to lift borrowing costs by a quarter-point, they will be watching carefully for any hint at what might come next.",
      "This would be the central bank\u2019s 10th consecutive interest rate increase \u2014 capping the fastest series of rate increases in four decades. But it could also be the central bank\u2019s last one, for now.",
      "Fed officials signaled in their last set of economic projections that they might stop raising interest rates once they reached a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, the level they are expected to hit on Wednesday. Officials will not release fresh economic projections after this meeting, which will leave economists carefully parsing both the central bank\u2019s 2 p.m. policy decision statement and a 2:30 p.m. news conference with Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, for hints at what comes next.",
      "Central bankers will be balancing conflicting signals. They have already done a lot to slow growth and wrestle rapid inflation under control, recent tumult in the banking industry could curb demand even more, and a looming fight over the debt ceiling poses a fresh source of risk to the economy. All of those are reasons for caution. But the economy has been fairly resilient and inflation is showing staying power, which could make some Fed officials feel that they still have work to do.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know going into Fed day.",
      "Fed policymakers are raising interest rates for a simple reason: Inflation has been painfully high for two years, and making money more expensive to borrow is the main tool government officials have to get it down.",
      "When the Fed raises interest rates, it makes it more expensive and often more difficult for families to take out loans to buy houses or cars or for businesses to raise money for expansions. That slows both consumer spending and hiring. As wage growth sags and unemployment rises, people become more cautious and the economy slows further.",
      "If that chain reaction sounds unpleasant, it\u2019s because it can be: When Paul Volcker\u2019s Fed ",
      " to nearly 20 percent in the early 1980s, it helped to ",
      " above 10 percent.",
      "But by cooling demand across the economy, a widespread slowdown can help to wrestle inflation under control. Companies find it harder to charge more without losing customers in a world where families are spending cautiously.",
      "And getting inflation under wraps is a big priority for the Fed: Price increases have been unusually rapid since early 2021, and while they have cooled off notably from a peak of about 9 percent last summer, they are ",
      " like travel and child care. Such price increases could prove stubborn and difficult to fully stamp out.",
      "To get price increases back in line, the Fed has raised rates to nearly 5 percent \u2014 and they are expected to cross that threshold on Wednesday. The last time rates eclipsed 5 percent was the summer of 2007, before the global financial crisis.",
      "What does it mean to have interest rates this high? More expensive mortgages have translated into a meaningful slowdown in the ",
      ", for one thing. There are also some signs that the labor market, while still very strong, is beginning to weaken \u2014 hiring is gradually slowing, and fewer jobs are ",
      ". But perhaps most visibly, the higher interest rates are starting to cause financial stress.",
      "Three big U.S. banks have failed \u2014 and required responses from the government \u2014 since early March, culminating in a government-enabled shotgun wedding between First Republic and JPMorgan Chase early ",
      ".",
      "Many of the banks under stress in recent weeks have suffered because they did not adequately protect themselves against rising interest rates, which have reduced the market value of their older mortgages and securities holdings.",
      "Fed officials will need to consider two issues related to the recent turmoil: Will there be further drama as other banks and financial companies struggle with higher rates, and will the bank trouble so far significantly slow the economy?",
      "Mr. Powell could give the world a sense of their thinking at his news conference.",
      "Between the banking upheaval and how much the Fed has lifted interest rates already, investors expect policymakers to pause after this move. But don\u2019t assume that means the slowdown is over.",
      "Higher Fed rates are like delayed reaction medicine: They start to kick in quickly, but their full effects take a while to play out. Last year\u2019s moves are still trickling through the economy, and by leaving rates on hold at a high level, officials could continue to weigh down the economy for months to come.",
      "And it could be that central bankers will not actually pause: Some have suggested that if inflation remains rapid and growth keeps its momentum, they could raise interest rates more. But it seems possible \u2014 even likely \u2014 that the bar for future rate moves will be higher.",
      "As high rates and bank problems bite, many economists think the country could be in for an economic downturn. Economists on the Fed\u2019s staff even said at the central bank\u2019s March meeting that they thought a mild recession was likely later this year in the aftermath of the banking crisis, ",
      " from the Fed\u2019s last meeting.",
      "Mr. Powell is sure to get asked about that at this news conference \u2014 and he may have to explain how the Fed hopes to keep a slight recession from turning into a big one.",
      "A gentle slowdown would probably feel a lot different for people on the ground than a major recession. One would involve slightly fewer job opportunities, milder wage growth and less boisterous business. The other could involve job loss and insecurity, slashed hours and earnings, and a pervading sense of glumness among American consumers.",
      "That\u2019s why Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting matters: It\u2019s not just technical policy tweaks Mr. Powell will be talking about, but decisions that will shape America\u2019s economic future."

But instead of reaching out to a therapist or a friend, he called his accountant and told him, \u201cThe only way you can give me cash is if I email you and cc my doctor. That\u2019s the new rule.\u201d Mulaney then tells us how he spent the next several months trying to circumvent his own rule, including by buying a $12,000 Rolex on a credit card and then pawning it for $6,000 so he could buy drugs with the cash.",
      "Throughout this extended and very funny bit, Mulaney plays with the audience\u2019s reaction to his bad behavior. As he details the Rolex caper \u2014 sort of laundering his own money \u2014 he says, \u201cI\u2019m pretty good at reading a room. You\u2019re all very impressed by this plan,\u201d and later, \u201cI feel your judgment. You must think I\u2019m pretty stupid.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s a punchline, yes, but Mulaney is also creating a boundary. He\u2019s entertaining us with an unflattering confession while making it clear, in a subtle way, that the audience won\u2019t get \u2014 and isn\u2019t entitled to \u2014 anything he doesn\u2019t want to share.",

I didn\u2019t grasp this shift until, in a short period of time, he checked into rehab, got a very public divorce, and had a child with the actress Olivia Munn.

Now, with a few clicks, you can find a trove of someone\u2019s talk show and podcast chatter, plow through it and then deploy some stray tidbit in order to contrast it with his private behavior to label him a hypocrite without really knowing the context or back story or how the circumstances of that person's life changed over time.",

      "You might think that, over the past year or two, public debate about the origins of the pandemic has loosened up. The lab-leak hypothesis has been aired repeatedly in Congress and endorsed with varying degrees of confidence by some intelligence agencies.",
      "Even so, pandemic tribalism over whether the virus emerged from a laboratory or in a natural spillover at a market or elsewhere has proved remarkably resilient. Any shred of new evidence, no matter how flimsy, is hailed as near-definitive proof by one side or the other.",
      "In mid-March, new analysis of genetic data collected in Wuhan\u2019s Huanan seafood market from January and February of 2020 ",
      " enormous publicity for a scrap of virological news \u2014 and probably the most attention that\u2019s ever been given to an obscure, adorable species of mammal known as raccoon dogs. The short version is this: An international team of scientists discovered genetic material from the market that was previously held by Chinese scientists and, in analyzing it, found at least one sample that contained, among other things scraped from the market, both raccoon-dog DNA and SARS-CoV-2 viral material.",
      "The analysis was notable, given the absence of hard evidence that an animal had been the source of the pandemic, the ",
      " over what kinds of animals were in that market and the fact that raccoon dogs had long been seen as a potential intermediate host for the virus.",
      "But it was also obviously limited evidence rather than a genetic smoking gun and suggested many follow-up questions. Was there any statistical correlation between the apparent presence of raccoon dogs in certain stalls and the presence of the virus in the same stalls? Did such proximity really indicate an animal infection, or did it simply reflect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the market? And what could we infer from genetic material collected beginning in January 2020, when we knew already that there were human infections the previous month and possibly earlier?",
      "But most commentary about the new report was not nearly so circumspect. \u201cThe Strongest Evidence Yet That an Animal Started the Pandemic,\u201d ",
      " of the first story to document the analysis. Other accounts were somewhat more equivocal, but readers could be forgiven for skipping past the caveats or for finishing any number of other write-ups and Twitter threads feeling as if a significant and perhaps even definitive piece of evidence had been found. In a few cases, scientists with public platforms ",
      " in interpreting the data, but ",
      " ",
      " ",
      " in to describe the report as hugely consequential. For some, the presence of two sets of genetic material in the same sample was the mark of a raccoon-dog infection, and such an infection would be de facto proof of a natural origin of the pandemic. As part of a ",
      " about the full shape of the pandemic, from origins to the present, Dr. Anthony Fauci highlighted the significance of the new report to me, as well.",
      "Then, last Wednesday, the computational biologist Jesse Bloom presented some persuasive evidence that everyone should perhaps calm down about raccoon dogs. He uploaded a ",
      " of the same data \u2014 this time measuring not just the relative prevalence of animal genetic material but also the relative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. What he found was quite striking: In the sample that contained the most raccoon-dog genetic material, the presence of the virus was so vanishingly small as to be statistically indistinguishable from zero. To be precise, in the only sample with abundant raccoon-dog genetic material that contained any SARS-CoV-2 at all, the presence of the virus registered at only one sequence fragment in 200,000,000. Overall, across the full database of genetic material found in the market, the presence of raccoon-dog DNA was negatively correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 material: When samples had more raccoon-dog genetic material, there was actually less SARS-CoV-2 than was found in other samples.",
      "\u201cThis definitely does not disprove that raccoon dogs could have been infected at some point,\u201d Bloom says. \u201cBut it certainly says these samples don\u2019t provide any evidence of this.\u201d",
      "In fact, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was much more closely associated with genetic material from other species, Bloom found, notably several kinds of fish and, to a lesser extent, humans. It is implausible, biologically, that the virus came from fish, but Bloom is also careful to say his analysis doesn\u2019t tell us all that much about the relationship with humans, either.",
      "\u201cIt just shows that from these data, everything is so mixed up, you can\u2019t reliably make any conclusions about what these associations of animal and viral genetic material mean,\u201d he says.",
      "What was briefly hailed as something like a pandemic Rosetta stone turned out to be, on further analysis, something more like a rock with some random scratches on it.",
      "This pattern does not apply only to research purporting to show evidence of a natural origin. Over the past year, we\u2019ve been treated to a series of lab-leak news cycles prompted by ",
      " and ",
      " in television interviews, though none have offered any truly significant new evidence.",
      "But the pattern is replicated when there is new research to scrutinize and share. Last year, for instance, when a group of scientists \u2014 including several who worked on the raccoon-dog report \u2014 published ",
      " of the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases at the Huanan market, it was similarly hailed as a major breakthrough pointing to an animal origin from a market spillover. But when the paper passed through peer review and was finally published, nearly all of its ",
      " and replaced with more cautious claims, including a statement about the limitations of the study.",
      "In the days since Bloom\u2019s new paper was posted, a number of scientists and commentators ",
      " \u2014 a reason to revise our understanding in the direction of an accidental leak. Perhaps, if you staked a lot on that initial raccoon-dog report, it does make sense to turn your dial a bit in the opposite direction. But more generally, I think, it is a sign of just how much of our understanding of the origins of the pandemic remains shrouded in uncertainty and how terrible we are in accepting that fact. Instead of scrutinizing new evidence, we rush to conclusions at every opportunity, processing all news in deeply motivated ways that blind us to anything that might contradict our preferred understanding and push us to see proof for our own side even when it isn\u2019t really there.",
      "How did this happen, and why does it continue to? The answers are perhaps not novel, but they are worth dwelling on. As Bloom says, a muddled and uncertain story isn\u2019t an especially exciting one, for scientists or for journalists. To many, it can feel that the very value of science hangs in the balance of the pandemic-origins debate, turning it into an increasingly important front in the new culture war.",
      "Because\u00a0the\u00a0material\u00a0is\u00a0so\u00a0deeply\u00a0technical, laypeople also\u00a0impose their own narrative maps on it. In processing such material, journalists often defer to the analysis of their sources. Across a pandemic in which the public was desperate for new information, we have probably gotten too used to treating hurriedly prepared reports as definitive science. And although the genetic data collected through early 2020 would seem of perhaps limited relevance to the question of what happened in, say, November 2019 \u2014 well, that data is about all we\u2019ve got, at the moment at least.",
      "This is all understandable. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good.",
      "\u201cIt is really important to try to understand the origin of Covid-19,\u201d Bloom says. \u201cBut a possible outcome \u2014 and certainly the outcome right now \u2014 is that we just don\u2019t know. I think part of science, and part of critical thinking in general, is supposed to be a high level of comfort with uncertainty and unknowns. And I think that\u2019s where it really sits right now: This is a situation where there\u2019s such intense interest that it becomes important to say, We don\u2019t really know the answers.\u201d"

      "Sarkar and Wrangham are describing the crucial evolutionary role of coalition formation to overcome the power of \u201ccoercive alpha males.\u201d So-called sub-elite males, according to them, could form coalitions in order to inflict \u201ccapital punishment and targeted conspiratorial killing\u201d that would overcome \u201cindividuals who persistently or egregiously violate social norms.\u201d",
      "At that point, Sarkar and Wrangham observe, \u201ca physically formidable coercive alpha male was nonetheless vulnerable to less formidable sub-elite males who possessed sufficient cognitive capacity to form an alliance to kill the alpha male.\u201d",
      "Christopher Boehm, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Southern California, contended in his 2001 book, \u201c",
      ": The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior,\u201d that these prehistoric developments are actually tracing \u201cthe roots of democracy.\u201d",

      "Boehm goes on: \u201cThe \u2018democratic\u2019 origins I describe are not recent and historical, but evolutionary and ancient. They date well back in the Paleolithic era and were intimately involved with the development of human nature itself.\u201d",
      "In effect, Sarkar, Wrangham and Boehm are describing an early stage of what over time has become an essential ingredient of a civilized, ordered society: the acquisition by the state of police power and the legal use of force to enforce norms and laws.",
      "In an email, Sarkar put it this way: \u201cHumans appear to have inherited the capacity to coordinate with one another to enact violence.\u201d While chimpanzees also demonstrate this capacity, according to Sarkar, \u201cone factor that contributes to the uniqueness of human violence is the ability to use language, which allows individuals to freely share thoughts and intentions with one another and to form remarkably precise plans. This means that humans are able to engage in much higher levels of coordination in planning and performing aggression.\u201d",

Only then could they act safely without retribution from the alpha male or his sycophants.",
      "This shift of authority and control away from abusive, domineering individual males to collective groups of less powerful men and women had substantial consequences for the composition of society, then and now:",
      "Alpha alliances of sub-elite males could kill coercive alpha males, drastically reducing the reproductive success of coercive alpha males. Such control would also have signaled the limits of acceptable intragroup aggression. The direction of selection on male aggression thus changed as a result: Rather than selection favoring coercive behavior that males used to achieve and maintain alpha status, the actions of alpha alliances ensured that selection acted against it. Simultaneously, the necessity of coordination and cooperation for targeted conspiratorial killing of alpha males meant that selection favored proactive aggression, and especially coalitionary proactive aggression.",

      "In a separate ",
      ", Wrangham argues:",
      "The explanation that best accounts for a novel selection pressure leading to a reduction in reactive aggression starting around 300,000 years ago is the emergence of collective intentionality in the form of language-based conspiracy. The evolution of this newly sophisticated cognitive ability would have led subordinates to socially select against aggressive fighters, creating a reverse dominance hierarchy. The spread of the new style of hierarchy could have occurred by individual learning or by selection of group cultures, and would have paved the way for diverse selection pressures to additionally influence the evolution of the characteristically human social traits.",
      "Where does all this fit in with the state of politics today?",
      "The barrage of criminal investigations and civil suits against Trump is, in many respects, the sophisticated and complex way America\u2019s democratic system of government has developed to constrain an ominous and even somewhat delusional deregulated alpha-male wannabe.",

The balance of power is likely to shift when physical strength no longer decides the outcome of every fight. That\u2019s essentially what happened, Boehm suggests, as our ancestors developed better weapons for hunting and butchering.",

Anything that suggests the aggressive, controlling behavior of an alpha male (or female) can trigger this form of righteous anger, which is sometimes called ",

      "The liberty foundation, Haidt goes on to say,",
      "supports the moral matrix of revolutionaries and \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d everywhere. The American Declaration of Independence is a long enumeration of \u201crepeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of absolute tyranny over these states.\u201d The document begins with the claim that \u201call men are created equal\u201d and ends with a stirring pledge of unity: \u201cWe mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.\u201d",
      "Pinker argued by email that over the long haul,",
      "history has seen the invention of increasingly complex systems that limit the power of the leader, such as coalitions (as per Sarkar and Wrangham), power-sharing or turn-taking agreements, parliaments, constitutions and rule-governed bureaucracies. Our leader is called a president because he merely presides over the government, rather than ruling over it.",
      "But, Pinker cautioned,",
      "we\u2019re always in danger of slipping back into the dynamic of dominance. In democracies, voters, on average, favor the taller candidate and often crave a strong leader. Presidents and prime ministers, for their part, often arrogate more power than the constitution allows. The system of laws that constrains the leader\u2019s power is often tested to its limits, and in countries that are not democracies, their only hope may be what Sarkar and Wrangham call an \u201calpha coalition,\u201d namely the coup plotters that many of us hope might someday depose Putin.",

      "This process of self-domestication, she continued,",
      "happens as groups of ",
      " (the less strong ones) work together to unseat alphas who exploit the community. They might ostracize him (the alpha male), but mostly they assassinate him. What that means is that slowly over time you get more egalitarian dynamics (such as the birth of democracy).",
      "In the case of the former president, McDermott wrote:",
      "Trump is a poster child for a coercive alpha male, and frankly I have been surprised that more Republicans don\u2019t try to take him on directly. I think part of it is that other potential Republican leaders are so narcissistic that they cannot band together in the kind of coalition that historically would have brought down a leader like this in one way or another. This depends on coalitional dynamics: men working together in cooperation, not against each other.",
      "Democratic norms, according to McDermott,",
      "are one way the country has tried to constrain the negative effects of Trump through things like rule of law and elections. (Biden won in 2020.) But they have not been as strong as many would like or hope for, and I agree that this is partly (although not entirely) related to increasing polarization (i.e., the inability to form strong united coalitional bonds).",

      "I have a meta-objection to Wrangham\u2019s use of biology to explain modern social behavior. It\u2019s far too deterministic; it lets us off the hook; it reduces our autonomy. When Wrangham\u2019s ideas seep into popular culture, they feed into people\u2019s fatalism about hierarchies, inequality and militarism.",
      ", a professor of anthropology at Rutgers, responded to my inquiry regarding the Sarkar-Wrangham paper by first acknowledging:",
      "I come from a very critical position. One foundational difference in perspectives is that my new book, \u201c",

      "Ferguson continued:",
      "I have been deeply involved in understanding war, conflict and politics in tribal societies, and I do not recognize anything like their idea of alphas facing death because of sub-alpha elite coalitions, except in the notable category of segmental tributary chiefdoms and states, where there are rivals near the top ready to rebel, and usually then take over.",
      "McAdams, the professor of psychology at Northwestern, does not share Horgan\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s doubts about Wrangham. In an essay written in the first year of the Trump presidency, \u201c",

      "If angry extraversion and disagreeableness characterize his temperament style, narcissism captures Trump\u2019s underlying motivational agenda. Although some dominant leaders subscribe to an overarching set of values and goals, Trump has no political philosophy to speak of, and his central goal in life is, and always has been, to promote himself. In Trump\u2019s case, narcissism seems to play well with the authoritarian dynamic.",
      "Trump, McAdams continues, \u201charkens back to an older evolutionarily paradigm for achieving status in primate groups. It is the paradigm of brute dominance, an atavistic proclivity whose primal appeal never seems to fade.\u201d",
      "Why, McAdams asks, \u201cdid 63 million Americans elect a president of the United States who was repeatedly described during the campaign, by both Democrats and Republicans, as a serial liar, a sexual predator, a swindler, a narcissist and a bully?\u201d",
      "He answers:",
      "No U.S. president in recent memory, and perhaps none ever, has tapped so effectively into the primal psychology of dominance. None has so effectively cultivated an authoritarian dynamic with his followers.",
      "In addition, according to McAdams:",
      "Trump\u2019s unique personality profile \u2014 the high extraversion and low agreeableness, the narcissistic motivations, the \u201cwarrior\u201d life story \u2014 seems perfectly suited to assume the authoritarian mantle at a time in American history when many Americans crave the security and exult in the excitement that such a mantle seems to confer. Even as he creates chaos, Donald Trump \u2014 as president of the United States \u2014 confidently assured Americans that he would deliver them from chaos. We will be standing safe and strong in the end. We will win. We will dominate.",
      "To some, Trump is less a cause than a symptom of the pervasive contemporary undermining of the American commitment to democratic values.",
      ", a political scientist at the University of Nebraska, argued by email that there is no doubt that there has been a weakening of democratic norms and that this erosion",
      "has loosened the constraints on what counts as behavioral red lines for political leaders. This is almost certainly true for coercive alpha males, but I think it is broader than that. As those norms decay, there is simply more room available for a range of personalities to get their swagger on in the political arena, as it were, aggressively and openly seeking power to aggrandize themselves and punish those who stand in the way.",
      "Smith pointed out that there are no \u201cgender limits here (think of Marjorie Taylor Greene).\u201d In addition, in Smith\u2019s view, the issue goes to the heart of \u201cthe corroding of what\u2019s considered beyond the behavioral pale.\u201d",
      "In a large heterogeneous republic like ours, Smith wrote, \u201cit is not easy. It is not just a matter of having clear rules or laws but establishing broad acceptance and respect for the process, something more in the realm of custom, tradition or folk intuition.\u201d But \u201conce established, those norms can help insulate democratic systems from what otherwise is a natural vulnerability to demagogues and tyrants.\u201d",
      "Those norms, Smith continued,",
      "are incredibly hard to institutionalize but, unfortunately, apparently much easier to destroy. And once they are gone, they may be incredibly hard to re-establish. If that\u2019s correct, then the end result may be a political system that is indeed more open to shocks of unconstrained coercive alpha male behavior but also to unprincipled behavior among political elites more generally. If there are few costs and clear benefits to such behavior, what\u2019s the argument for not seeking power solely to benefit you and yours and to heck with everybody else?"

      "We\u2019re talking here about the attraction of third parties. So tempting. So disaster-inducing.",

      "The way so many people did in 2016, when Trump won the presidency thanks to the Electoral College votes of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Which Hillary Clinton would probably have carried if the folks who were appalled by Trump had voted for her instead of the Libertarian or Green Party candidates.",

      "Now Nader had a phenomenal career as a champion of consumer protection and the environment. But this was a terrible finale. His candidacy gave Floridians who felt that Gore was not very exciting a chance to declare their disaffection. It gave them a chance to feel superior. It gave the country a new President Bush. And a war in Iraq.",

      "In a nod to the ongoing risk the coronavirus poses to millions of Americans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Wednesday that adults 65 and older and those with weakened immune systems receive another dose of the reformulated booster that debuted last fall.",
      "The endorsement followed a daylong discussion by the C.D.C.\u2019s expert advisers. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the booster plan on Tuesday, and the C.D.C.\u2019s recommendation was the final administrative step. Eligible Americans will be able to receive booster doses immediately.",
      "Federal health officials are also phasing out the original vaccine formulas created by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, revoking their authorizations in the United States. And instead of needing an initial series of two shots, unvaccinated people will now require just a single dose of the reformulated, or \u201cbivalent,\u201d Covid shot to be considered vaccinated.",
      "Until now, federal officials had required two doses of the older vaccine before recipients could begin to receive the bivalent boosters, a process some experts felt was confusing.",
      "Limited data on the reformulated vaccines indicate that in older adults, the shots offer ",
      " against severe disease and death from Covid, although the protection wanes rapidly in the weeks after inoculation.",
      "There are about ",
      " adults 65 and older in the United States, accounting for about 16 percent of the population, according to the Census Bureau. And ",
      " Americans have weak immune systems because of an illness or a medication.",
      "Roughly 250 people in the United States are ",
      " from Covid-related causes each day, a vast majority of whom are over 70 or have impaired immune systems. The median age of those hospitalized is 75, according to the C.D.C. Yet only about 43 percent of adults 65 and older have received a bivalent booster shot so far.",
      "By this point, most Americans have built up some immunity against the virus, whether through prior infections, vaccinations or both. The new guidelines acknowledge as much, but allow for those still at high risk from the virus to protect themselves, and to do so free of charge.",
      "\u201cThe one-size-fits-all policy was simple but not optimal,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician and health policy expert at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe new regimen acknowledges that there\u2019s now an extraordinary spectrum of Covid risk, from mild to massive, depending on who you are.\u201d",
      "People who are severely immunocompromised, such as organ transplant recipients, may want to opt for booster shots every six months or even more frequently, Dr. Faust said.",
      "The new guidelines come weeks after ",
      " and ",
      " recommended additional shots for older adults and immunocompromised people, among others. ",
      "The C.D.C. now says that adults 65 and older may opt for another dose of the bivalent vaccine at least four months after their first shot. Those with weakened immune systems may do so two months after their previous bivalent dose, and may choose to receive more doses in consultation with their health care provider.",
      "In the meeting of C.D.C. advisers on Wednesday, Dr. Camille Kotton, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, noted that the new recommendations did not include immunocompromised children 6 months through 4 years of age. That leaves those medically frail children \u2014 including recipients of organ transplants \u2014 unprotected against the virus, she said.",
      "\u201cAs a mom and doctor, this seems like we are leaving them so vulnerable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "For most Americans, the F.D.A. plans to encourage annual Covid shots in the fall, much as it does with flu shots. Health officials will decide on the exact composition of the shot in June, based on the version of the virus circulating at the time.",
      "The bivalent vaccine targets the original variant of the coronavirus as well as variants BA.4 and BA.5, which were dominant last summer. But BA.4 and BA.5 were quickly supplanted by newer versions.",
      "The most recent Omicron subvariant, ",

      "Federal health officials also are making changes to the process for those receiving the initial shots.",
      "Unvaccinated people will receive a single dose of the bivalent vaccine, rather than multiple doses of the original monovalent vaccine. The rationale is that most unvaccinated Americans now presumably have some measure of immunity from a prior infection and may not need two doses at the beginning, the F.D.A. said.",
      "Some experts were sharply critical of the advice. Reams of data suggest that the vaccines are most protective when given in two doses and followed by one or more boosters to reinforce the shield, said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College.",
      "\u201cF.D.A. has consistently over-interpreted the performance of the bivalent formulation when given as a booster,\u201d Dr. Moore said. \u201cNow it seems to have gone beyond the science and decided it has some kind of magic power as a first dose.\u201d",
      "It may be reasonable to assume that nearly all unvaccinated adults have already been infected at least once and can get by with just a single dose, said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.",
      "\u201cI guess the F.D.A. is just trying to simplify given the reality on the ground,\u201d he said. But \u201cimmunologically, you\u2019d want to get two shots if it\u2019s your first exposure.\u201d",
      "The agency could instead recommend two doses of a bivalent vaccine and say that those who know of a prior infection can elect to forego the second dose, Dr. Bhattacharya said. But, he added, \u201cin reality, I doubt a clause like that would make much practical difference.\u201d",
      "The F.D.A. said it had \u201ccarefully reviewed the available epidemiologic evidence, scientific publications and data provided by sponsors indicating that a single bivalent vaccine dose provided to individuals previously infected with Covid-19 provides an immune response equal to, or superior to, two doses of the original vaccine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe agency believes that this approach will help encourage future vaccination, particularly among those who have not chosen to be vaccinated to date,\u201d the F.D.A. said in its statement."

      "Ever since Bobbie Wert was 8 years old, her stomach has hurt. \u201cMy tummy hurts,\u201d was her refrain as a girl, and the ache was accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea that kept her out of school \u2014 sometimes for half the days in the school year.",
      "Doctors poked and scanned but couldn\u2019t figure out anything wrong. Over the years, they cut her open and removed bits and pieces yet couldn\u2019t drive away the pain. So doctors prescribed opioids in increasing doses \u2014 even fentanyl patches \u2014 that left her addicted. At age 43, she now is off opioids but still suffers every single day, enduring chronic pain like an estimated 50 million other Americans.",
      "Wert is part of a vast and mysterious panorama of pain that is increasing, sometimes with no obvious physical cause. And while chronic pain is a global problem, it is particularly puzzling in America. In other wealthy countries, it\u2019s the elderly who report the most chronic pain, which makes some sense. But in the United States it\u2019s the middle-aged \u2014 especially the jobless and people like Wert, who did not graduate from high school \u2014 who suffer the most. It is a plague on the less educated.",
      "All this raises the question: Is this physical suffering a canary in the coal mine warning us of larger dysfunction in our society?",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know: Tens of millions of Americans are suffering pain. But chronic pain is not just a result of car accidents and workplace injuries but is also linked to troubled childhoods, loneliness, job insecurity and a hundred other pressures on working families.",
      "This essay is the first in an occasional series I\u2019ll be writing about the interrelated crises unfolding in working-class America. I\u2019ll explore the cluster of tightly woven problems that hold back our people and our country: childhood trauma, educational failure, addiction, mental health issues, homelessness, loneliness, family breakdown, unemployment \u2014 and, we increasingly recognize, physical pain.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s lives are coming apart, and this leads to huge increases in physical pain,\u201d said Angus Deaton, a Nobel Prize winner in economics who with Anne Case popularized the term \u201cdeaths of despair.\u201d He, Case and Arthur A. Stone warn in a recent ",

Now I understand that the pain was very real, but often more complicated than a broken arm from a brawl.",

      "Dr. Warraich said that we tend to misperceive chronic pain simply as pain that lasts longer. Acute pain typically has a specific anatomical source \u2014 such as the shock you feel when you touch a hot stove \u2014 while chronic pain sometimes, not always, originates in the brain rather than the body. An extreme example is ",
      ", in which an amputee feels intense pain in a limb that no longer exists.",
      "Accustomed to treating acute pain, physicians diagnose through imaging and knowledge of anatomy: If someone suffers from chronic back pain, get an X-ray! And imaging often finds something odd that may suggest a surgical solution. In Dr. Warraich\u2019s case, there were prolapsed discs. But it\u2019s also true that X-rays of people with no pain show similar anatomical faults.",

      " that some people with substantial knee pain have normal X-rays, while many whose X-rays suggest significant arthritis feel no pain at all.",
      "Think of the brain as the control panel for a pain alarm system that mostly protects the body from injury \u2014 but sometimes goes haywire. It can blare like a home alarm system that maddeningly thinks a window has been opened when it hasn\u2019t been.",
      "Unfortunately, brain alarms are harder to turn off.",
      "*",
      "Medicines that work very well for acute pain, like opioids, were prescribed for many years for chronic pain like Wert\u2019s, resulting in a tsunami of addiction that now claims more than 100,000 lives a year in overdoses alone \u2014 and leaving large numbers of pain sufferers dependent on pills that they now struggle to obtain. While opioids can provide relief, some experts also believe that opioids were never a sound choice for long-term pain.",
      "Fortunately, some new treatments are emerging for chronic pain, but they are imperfect and often not covered by insurance. For starters, we\u2019re learning that pain sometimes responds better to approaches that target the brain and psyche, not the body. For example, phantom limb pain is helped with ",
      ", in which the sufferer repeatedly looks in the mirror at a remaining limb, to trick the brain into thinking that the body is doing just fine.",
      "There is no single pain center in the brain, but chronic pain often reverberates in parts of the brain that can also be involved in emotions and traumatic memories, and that resonates with Bobbie Wert. She looks back at her odyssey through unexplained pain and addiction and has a simple explanation: \u201cIt was trauma.\u201d As the title of a best-selling book by Bessel van der Kolk on how psychological trauma can manifest as physical pain, puts it, \u201c",

      "She recalls only fragments of the rest of those difficult years. \u201cIt was just men in and out of our house constantly,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember old men coming in, but I don\u2019t remember what happened.\u201d",
      "For all the school she missed, Wert was a brilliant student who managed to stay near the top of her class. But she fell in love at age 15 with a man six years older, then, seeking stability in a chaotic life, married him and dropped out of school. She had two children by the time she was 18.",
      "Instead of subsiding, the pain ramped up. For a while, doctors thought it was irritable bowel syndrome. Then they said it was endometriosis, leading to surgery at the age of 20 and a full hysterectomy a year later.",
      "None of that helped, and doctors later diagnosed interstitial cystitis, part of a spectrum called painful bladder syndrome. All of these diagnoses \u2014 irritable bowel syndrome, endometriosis and painful bladder syndrome \u2014 are commonly applied to people with chronic pain that is difficult to explain. The end of the diagnostic line is often fibromyalgia, a catchall to describe chronic pain in several locations.",

      " found. In effect, chronic pain is tightly woven into the bundle of diseases of despair, and causation probably runs in several directions.",
      "There\u2019s some evidence that trauma and stress teach the brain to be hypervigilant and put the pain alarm system on a hair trigger. This builds on itself: Researchers have also found that chronic pain can result in greater sensitivity, so that pain breeds more pain.",
      "Pain even changes the physical brain. Several studies have ",
      " that long-term pain leads to a loss of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, although experts are still working out the implications of that.",

      "Lopez later managed his pain with OxyContin, and for a while he got by. He landed a good job as a medic at a university in Oregon and had a house, two cars, a girlfriend and a son. But once he couldn\u2019t get OxyContin prescriptions, he began buying painkillers on the street, and that proved unaffordable. So he bought heroin.",
      "The first heroin high proved difficult to replicate \u2014 and Lopez\u2019s habit grew expensive. He started dealing so that he could be paid in powder. His son bounced between him and his now ex-girlfriend (who also became addicted), depending on who was in better shape.",
      "On top of his excruciating pain, Lopez was regularly on the run from the law, and he lost his home and his health care provider\u2019s license. He overdosed nine times.",
      "Lopez admits that he made bad choices. But pain made poor choices more likely.",
      "\u201cWhen I would have my bouts of neck pain, it magnified everything,\u201d he told me. \u201cDepression, anxiety, despair, everything was worse when I was in pain.\u201d He was eventually homeless.",
      "Finally, in 2019, Lopez gave up.",

      "He overdosed and turned blue, but rescuers managed to revive him with five doses of naloxone. Awakening, he was exhausted and felt he had hit bottom. After that, drugs were less satisfying, and he found out that his girlfriend was pregnant. Soon after, he resolved to live: He went through detox and hasn\u2019t used drugs since 2019. Now he is more prudent about avoiding anything that might aggravate his pain, but it still returns in waves, such as when his daughter unexpectedly jumped on his back. When it comes, he bulls through it with over-the-counter remedies and manages to go on with his life.",

      ", director of the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center at the University of Michigan, believes that we already have a toolbox of remedies that can help 80 percent or 90 percent of chronic pain sufferers but that our treatment system and insurance protocols betray those in need.",

The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.",
      "But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of\u00a0568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.",
      "\u201cMale w/machete is back,\u201d the report on one 911 call states. \u201cAnother security guard was just assaulted,\u201d another says. A man with a four-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.",
      "In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.",
      "When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city\u2019s most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.",
      "The closure also seemed to be the latest indicator of San Francisco\u2019s faltering economic prospects, providing more grist for an ongoing debate over ",

But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city's center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.",
      "In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco\u2019s continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco\u2019s downtown remains at roughly a third of prepandemic levels \u2014 lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to ",

Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.",

      "Deaths from Covid-19 in the United States are the lowest they\u2019ve been since March 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s ",
      ". Case rates have similarly plummeted, though infections have become harder to track because of the widespread availability of ",
      "; many of the monitoring systems that were set up at the beginning of the pandemic have also been wound down.",
      "Is this finally the beginning of the end of the pandemic, or just another spring ebb before a new variant initiates a summer wave? (For the past two years, numbers have fallen between March and June, before rising in July.) The New York Times spoke with epidemiologists and infectious disease experts to gauge how they\u2019re thinking about this particular juncture in the pandemic \u2014 what the risk is right now, what precautions they\u2019re continuing to take, who is still getting severely ill and dying, and what the future may bring.",
      "Experts agree that the risk from Covid-19 right now is low, and spring 2023 feels different from previous years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a stage of stability where people are making choices to return their lives to something closer to normal,\u201d said Dr. Robert Wachter, the chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cAnd I think that makes sense. Cases are relatively low; deaths are relatively low.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason for this improvement is that virtually everyone in the United States has some form of immunity now, whether from vaccines, a previous infection or both. Medications like ",
      " have also significantly reduced the risk of serious illness.",
      "Dr. Taison Bell, an infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia, said that in his intensive care unit, \u201cwe will see an occasional Covid-19 case, but we\u2019re not seeing a lot of cases that are leading to people being on the ventilator.\u201d Now, most of the people Dr. Bell is treating for Covid are older and either have pre-existing conditions that compromise their immune systems or lung function, or they haven\u2019t been vaccinated. It\u2019s essential, he said, that people who are at high risk for severe infection get a ",
      " if they haven\u2019t already (a second dose was also ",

      "Another reason things are different this spring is that there have been no new, game-changing variants \u2014 \u201cno new Greek letters,\u201d as Dr. Wachter put it \u2014 for the last year and a half. Variations of Omicron that have some immune-evading properties, such as the current dominant strain, ",
      ", have emerged, but Paxlovid and vaccines are still effective against them.",
      "Despite the good news, experts are still taking some precautions. Because while the numbers are headed in the right direction, roughly 100,000 Americans are still being infected with Covid-19 every week, and more than 150 are dying from the infection every day.",
      "Dr. Wachter continues to wear a mask in most crowded indoor settings, like on an airplane or in a museum, he said, but not if he needs to pop into a store quickly.",
      "His main motivation is wanting to avoid ",
      ". \u201cUnlike the way I felt two or three years ago, I have no fear that I\u2019m going to die of this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think long Covid is very real. My wife has a mild version of it, so I see it up close and personal.\u201d",
      "Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has young children, said that she stopped wearing a mask at the grocery store or in the office, though she still dons one on public transportation. She said that the disruptions Covid and other respiratory infections caused this winter, like missing school and work, were worth avoiding.",
      "The experts especially urged people to keep taking precautions, such as masking and testing before big indoor gatherings, if they or a loved one are at high risk.",
      "\u201cI think we have to do what we can to mitigate risk, not just for ourselves, but also we live in a community,\u201d said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician who still tests herself before going to events. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the person next to me is immunocompromised, and I don\u2019t want to give them Covid.\u201d",
      "The experts cautioned that it\u2019s always possible for a new variant to emerge and start another wave.",
      "Dr. Kuppalli said that she was watching Omicron subvariant XBB.1.16, also known as Arcturus, which is driving a surge in India. XBB.1.16 ",
      " for about 10 percent of cases in the United States and comes with a new symptom: conjunctivitis.",
      "Dr. Rivers is paying attention to another new subvariant, XBB.1.9.1, which makes up about 8 percent of U.S. infections right now. She expects cases to start rising again as the weather warms, driven by either these variants or one like them. \u201cWe generally see a quiet spring followed by a summer resurgence that starts in the South\u201d because people are more likely to gather indoors when it gets too hot, she said.",
      "And this, experts say, is likely our new normal. \u201cThe stage where we are now is probably a version of a stage we\u2019ll be in a year from now, maybe two years from now, maybe five years from now,\u201d Dr. Wachter said. \u201cIt could get a little worse, in which case I think people and societies change if they\u2019re being rational. I think it\u2019s unlikely to get much better.\u201d"

      "That mysterious twinge on one side of your lower abdomen that isn\u2019t occurring alongside your period? The one that keeps coming back, every month and roughly in the middle of your menstrual cycle? That sensation is most likely pain associated with ovulation, or, as it\u2019s known in the medical world, mittelschmerz (the German term for \u201cmiddle pain\u201d).",
      "It\u2019s difficult to pin down just how prevalent ovulation pain is because, in most cases, it\u2019s so mild that women don\u2019t report it, said Dr. Jenna Turocy, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University. Some estimates suggest as many as ",
      " of women of reproductive age feel it almost every month. It can also be difficult to identify; the sensation might linger for a few minutes or it could last for hours. It sometimes feels like mild cramping or, for others, it\u2019s so painful that it gets confused with ",
      ".",
      "There is very little research on mittelschmerz, with only a handful of published papers on the topic, many of which either date back to the early 1900s or are small and focused on rare medical complications, said Dr. Daniel Breitkopf, a gynecologist at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot on the why,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd very little of the research has to do with the day-to-day experience.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear, for example, why some women don\u2019t experience pain with ovulation at all.",
      "Ovulation is a fairly complex process, said Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg, vice president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School. It involves one follicle (a fluid-filled sac in the ovary that carries a single egg) growing drastically in size, from less than ",
      ", in a matter of days. When the follicle has matured, the egg pushes out through its surface. \u201cEvery ovulation is essentially a ruptured cyst,\u201d Dr. Ginsburg said. ",
      " have shown that ovulation coincides with a small explosion of fluid and sometimes blood on the surface of the ovary, Dr. Ginsburg said. Because ovulation takes place in either one of the two ovaries, those who feel the pain will notice that it occurs on alternating sides from one cycle to the next.",
      "\u201cMy patients mostly have infertility and are trying to get pregnant, so they\u2019re kind of reassured when they feel this pain,\u201d which is often an indication of their highest chance in a cycle to become pregnant, Dr. Ginsburg said.",
      "It\u2019s not clear which exact part of the ovulation process might cause pain. One ",
      ", which measured hormone levels and follicle size, found that women reported pain before the egg had emerged, suggesting that the pain might be a \u201cpre-ovulatory event.\u201d One explanation is that the expansion of the follicle can lead to some cramping, Dr. Ginsburg said.",
      "There are two other potential culprits, said Dr. Aparna Sridhar, an OB-GYN at U.C.L.A. Health: luteinizing hormone, called LH, which triggers follicle rupture, and ",
      ", which are hormone-like substances that spur muscle contractions (and thus, sometimes pain), including in surrounding muscles like the bowels. The surge in LH invites a surge in prostaglandins, she said.",
      "Teenagers who have just started menstruating, for example, tend not to feel ovulatory pain, Dr. Sridhar said. That\u2019s most likely because, though their follicles expand, they don\u2019t ovulate at that point in their lives and therefore don\u2019t have high levels of LH or prostaglandins.",
      "Ovulation pain should not be debilitating, and severe pain that hasn\u2019t subsided after 24 hours is a sign of a larger problem, Dr. Breitkopf said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that when people come in for this, it\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s pretty bad and it\u2019s affecting their life,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s bad enough that they may have to take time off work.\u201d",
      "In some cases, for example, the pain might be indicative of ",
      " from the ruptured follicle, which might require surgery. Women with endometriosis or those who have had previous surgery that scarred their ovaries tend to feel more acute pain around ovulation.",
      "Experts say that the medicine and treatment that help with period cramps should also help manage most cases of mild ovulation pain, like over-the-counter pain medications. \u201cA heat pack can be helpful too,\u201d Dr. Turocy said.",
      "For those who aren\u2019t trying to get pregnant and for whom the pain gets in the way of day-to-day activities, hormonal birth control is another option because it tends to stop ovulation altogether, Dr. Sridhar said. \u201cThat can make life easier.\u201d"

      "Researchers surveyed more than 4,000 participants at four Mayo Clinic sites in Minnesota, Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin.

      "The findings underscore the physical, economic and social challenges women face as they age, enduring sometimes debilitating physical changes while navigating the discomfort of discussing menopause with younger or male colleagues, said Dr. Ekta Kapoor, a co-author of the study and an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. \u201cThe topic of menopause is taboo in general but even more so at the workplace,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from women that they don\u2019t want to come across as a \u2018complainer\u2019 at work or they\u2019ll bring up menopause and people will roll their eyes.\u201d This, Dr. Kapoor added, can exacerbate the psychological challenges.",
      "The economic loss calculated by the Mayo Clinic study is likely an underestimate, Dr. Kapoor said, because the women surveyed have access to health insurance and potential treatments for their symptoms, which is not the case for many Americans.",
      "The findings \u201caffirm what patients tell me,\u201d said Dr. Makeba Williams, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. (Dr. Williams was not involved with the research.) One of her patients, for example, is a university professor who was so troubled by the brain fog she had during the transition to menopause that she decided to stop teaching advanced level courses, Dr. Williams said. \u201cHer symptoms had gotten so bad, she could not find the next word when lecturing. That story can come in many different versions. Women see in their day-to-day lives that their productivity is impacted.\u201d",
      "But most Americans don\u2019t have the ability to choose to cut back on work the way some women in the study did, Dr. Williams said. \u201cMany women don\u2019t have the privilege of saying I\u2019m just not going to teach this course \u2014 because maybe if you don\u2019t show up, you will not have a job, and that has economic and personal financial impact too.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, when Grace Ward was a 44-year-old supervisor at a local library in Kalamazoo, Mich., she started getting intense migraines for the first time in her life \u2014 a symptom, she later realized, of perimenopause, the transition to menopause.",
      "\u201cFor two to three days a month, I had to keep my head down. The sensitivity to light was just obnoxious,\u201d she said. She also experienced \u201cwild\u201d mood swings and hot flashes that kept her awake at night and she began menstruating twice a month \u2014 all of which made her \u201cmarkedly tired.\u201d",
      "Ms. Ward used up her sick days to take time off work and eventually \u201cmy managers were starting to question whether I was still up to it.\u201d That\u2019s when she decided to resign.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be better to leave than be fired,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible that we \u2014 as women \u2014 have to work through this craziness. I routinely feel bad for us.\u201d"

      "More than 75 members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine demanded on Thursday that the organization explain why it has for years failed to return or repurpose millions of dollars donated by the Sackler family, including some who led Purdue Pharma.",
      "The company\u2019s drug, OxyContin, helped set in motion a prescription opioid crisis that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The New York Times reported this month that even as the Academies advised the government on opioid policy, the organization ",
      " and appointed influential members to its committees who had financial ties to Purdue Pharma.",
      "One report issued by the Academies claimed that 100 million, or 40 percent of Americans, were in chronic pain. The figure, later found to be inflated, was cited by drugmakers to convince doctors to write large numbers of opioid prescriptions.",
      "In a letter delivered to Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academies of Sciences, scientists and economists called on the organization to clarify how research committee members who ran nonprofits heavily funded by Purdue were chosen to provide guidance to federal authorities on opioid policy: \u201cHow did the system fail in the past?\u201d the letter asked.",
      "\u201cThe academy was looking like it had been morally asleep for the last 30 years,\u201d Robert Putnam, an author of the letter and Harvard public policy professor, said in an interview.",
      "\u201cWe of course take the concerns of National Academy of Sciences members seriously, and their concerns were in part what prompted very serious conversations here about returning or repurposing the funds, to which the N.A.S. remains committed,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Friday.",
      "The National Academies was chartered in 1863 by Abraham Lincoln to advise the nation on scientific and medical questions. The institution elects new members each year \u2014 elite scientists and physicians \u2014 and delivers influential advice to the White House, Congress and federal agencies.",
      "Though about 70 percent of the National Academies budget comes from federal funds, it also raises private donations from individuals, nonprofits and companies, including Chevron, Google, Merck and Medtronic.",
      "\u201cIf they begin to see the problem \u2014 that is, this huge influx of private money, and private money often comes with implicit strings \u2014 they will see it\u2019s a threat to the core principles of the Academies,\u201d Dr. Putnam said of the National Academies\u2019 current leadership.",
      "Signatories of the letter include eight Nobel Prize winners. Two authors are National Academies of Sciences members who in 2017 urged top officials to distance the organization from the Sacklers.",
      "Robert M. Hauser, a prominent social scientist, wrote in an October 2017 email to two top Academies officials: \u201cI have been thinking about the willingness of the N.A.S. to accept support from the Sackler family and to produce events and awards \u2014 lectures, forums, colloquia, prizes \u2014 however meritorious, in their name.\u201d",
      "He and another Academies member had concluded \u201cthat the N.A.S. should disassociate itself from the Sacklers.\u201d The other member was Angus Deaton, a Nobel Laureate and co-author of a book about surging deaths tied to substance use and suicide among members of the white working class.",
      "Dr. Deaton said in an interview that he and Dr. Hauser had asked for a call with top officials about the Sacklers\u2019 involvement.",
      "\u201cWe wanted more than anything to warn them that there was a lot of trouble ahead down this route, and that tens of thousands of people were dying and the Sacklers were giving them money,\u201d Dr. Deaton recalled in an interview.",
      "Dr. Hauser, who worked at the National Academies from 2010 to 2016, referenced an in-depth ",
      " about the Sackler family\u2019s \u201cruthless\u201d marketing of OxyContin in the email, which was sent to Bruce Darling, then the executive officer, and James Hinchman, then the chief operating officer.",
      "\u201cSooner or later I thought this was going to blow up in their faces,\u201d Dr. Hauser said in an interview. \u201cAnd it would really besmirch the reputation of the Academies, which I felt strongly about defending.\u201d",
      "Four minutes after Dr. Hauser\u2019s initial request was emailed, he received a reply from Mr. Darling: \u201cWe had a conversation at the N.A.S. Council this past summer on the very issue that you raise, and we made a decision that I would be pleased to discuss with you.\u201d",
      "Mr. Darling and Mr. Hinchman did not respond to messages requesting comment.",
      "Dr. Hauser recalled that Mr. Darling summarized the Sacklers\u2019 donations as something that had been discussed and required no new action. Dr. Deaton and Dr. Hauser felt their concerns had been dismissed.",
      "Two National Academies reports on opioids have faced criticism from experts. One published in 2011 included two panelists with significant financial ties to Purdue and concluded that 100 million Americans were in chronic pain, a number that proved to be greatly inflated. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later estimated that roughly 52 million adults suffered from chronic pain, and more than 17 million U.S. adults experience high-impact or more severe chronic pain.)",
      "Still, the report armed drug companies with a talking point that ",
      " with Food and Drug Administration officials who oversaw opioid approvals. It was also ",
      " in their response to a Senate inquiry.",
      "Another Academies committee on opioid policy was ",
      " by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, because of some members\u2019 links to Purdue. That panel, formed in 2016, went forward with a study after four members were replaced.",
      "Articles in ",
      " and in ",
      " ",
      ", or the British Medical Journal, have also noted the Sacklers\u2019 ties to the Academies and identified additional committee members with links to Purdue.",
      "The letter on Friday asked for \u201cclear answers\u201d to what procedures are in place to \u201censure that advisory committee members are properly vetted,\u201d among other questions.",
      "The Academies told The Times that beginning in 2019 Sackler family donations were no longer used for science-related events, research and awards, the purposes for which they were intended. The funds \u201cwere never used to support any advisory activities on the use of opioids,\u201d Megan Lowry, a spokeswoman, said.",
      "The donations amounted to roughly $19 million and, as invested funds in the institution\u2019s endowment, were worth about $31 million in late 2021, the most recent accounting available. Universities that accepted Sackler funds, including Tufts and Brown, have reallocated some of the money to addiction prevention and treatment efforts.",
      "Members of the Sackler family who were active in running Purdue Pharma began donating in 2008 to the National Academies of Sciences. The money was used to sponsor forums and studies.",
      "In 2015, family members ",
      ", according to reports by the organization\u2019s treasurer. Dr. and Ms. Sackler died in 2017 and 2019. An attorney for the family said those donations had \u201cnothing at all to do with pain, medications or anything related to the company.\u201d",
      "Dame Jillian Sackler, whose husband, Arthur, died years before OxyContin arrived on the market, began giving to the Academies in 2000, and donated $5 million by 2017, Academies reports show.",
      "A day after The Times\u2019s report ran, the National Academies ",
      " saying it had explored returning or repurposing the funds. \u201cDoing so in an ethical and transparent manner will be the most important consideration,\u201d the organization said.",
      "A perceived lack of urgency in the statement helped prompt the new letter from Academies members. \u201cIt\u2019s another brushoff the way we read it,\u201d Dr. Hauser said.",
      "He added: \u201cWe wrote our letter to tell them, \u2018You guys have to be serious, prompt and sufficient about this.\u2019\u201d"

From 2011 to 2020, the figure rose from 4.8 million to 7.5 million, the team found, a period in which the overall number of pediatric E.R. visits fell. In effect, the proportion of E.R. visits for mental health-related issues roughly doubled, from 7.7 percent to 13.1 percent.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s promising that they report that early and middle-life bilingualism has a beneficial effect on cognitive health in later life,\u201d said Miguel Arce Renter\u00eda, a neuropsychologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis would line up with the existing literature.\u201d",
      "In recent years, scientists have gained a greater understanding of bilingualism and the aging brain, though not all their findings have aligned. Some have found that if people who have fluency in two languages develop dementia, they\u2019ll ",

      ", they may be able to deploy similar strategies in other skills \u2014 such as multitasking, managing emotions and self-control \u2014 that help delay dementia later on.",
      "The new study tested 746 people age 59 to 76. Roughly 40 percent of the volunteers had no memory problems, while the others were patients at memory clinics and had experienced confusion or memory loss.",
      "All were tested on a variety of vocabulary, memory, attention and calculation tasks. They were asked to recall previously named objects, for example, and to spell words backward, follow three-part commands and copy designs presented to them.",
      "Volunteers who reported using a second language daily between age 13 and 30 or between age 30 and 65 had higher scores on language, memory, focus, attention, and decision-making abilities compared with those who were not bilingual at those ages.",
      "Investigating bilingualism at different life stages is a unique approach, said Boon Lead Tee, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. With the impressively large sample size, she said, the authors of the study can probably generate other novel results, such as whether the age at which a person acquired each language affected their cognition in later life.",
      "She cautioned, however, that the study only focused on one aspect of bilingualism: using two languages every day for long periods of time. The positive effects on cognition may turn out to be caused by another factor, such as the age at which the two languages were encoded into memory, or the particular demographic or life experiences of people who happen to be bilingual.",

      "The drug manufacturer Eli Lilly announced on Wednesday that a clinical trial of an experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug showed it can slow progress of the feared disease and allow patients to have more time when they can still live independently, performing tasks like cooking meals, going to the store and driving a car.",
      "Lilly announced its results, from a trial involving 1,736 patients, in a ",
      ", as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A peer-reviewed paper will follow.",
      "The drug, donanemab, is not a cure, but along with two other drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it may be a turning point in the long and frustrating quest to find an Alzheimer\u2019s treatment. ",
      "\u201cThese all point in the same direction,\u201d said Dr. Ronald Petersen, the director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic. He added that the donanemab results were \u201cmodest\u201d but \u201cmeaningful.\u201d ",
      "Dr. Petersen has done paid consulting work for pharmaceutical companies, including Lilly. He was not involved in the design or execution of any of the recent trials.",
      "Dr. Samuel Gandy, a professor of Alzheimer\u2019s disease research at Mount Sinai, was more subdued.",
      "\u201cFamilies and researchers are stuck with what we know now, which is that two drugs have a statistically meaningful but only modest clinical benefit,\u201d he said, echoing Dr. Petersen\u2019s assessment. He has consulted and received research support from pharmaceutical companies but was not involved in the Lilly trial.",
      "Dr. Petersen said that patients and their families must be counseled about a dire side effect of donanemab \u2014 a risk of brain swelling that can result in death. Three patients in the Lilly trial died.",
      "A similar percentage of deaths from the same side effect followed in the clinical trial of Leqembi, an ",
      " from the company Eisai. A third drug, Aduhelm, was also ",
      ", but is ",
      " because of concerns about its effectiveness and its high price. ",
      " were reported in patients taking Aduhelm after it was approved.",
      "The results come after decades of failed attempts, despair, discouragement and billions of dollars spent. Most big pharmaceutical companies simply gave up on Alzheimer\u2019s drugs.",
      "After those failures, some researchers decided that a leading hypothesis about the disease \u2014 that it is driven by hard, Brillo-like plaques in the brain made of amyloid protein \u2014 was incorrect. But the successes of the new drugs, which attack amyloid, bolster the hypothesis.",
      "Taking the drugs is not like taking an antibiotic and seeing a fever go away. To measure the new drug\u2019s effectiveness, the Lilly researchers instead looked at how likely patients were to progress through the categories of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, going from mild cognitive impairment to mild dementia, or from mild to moderate dementia. These are significant changes that have a profound effect on patients and their families.",
      "The company reported that two to three out of 10 patients taking donanemab progressed over the next 18 months as compared to the expected three to four patients who did while taking a placebo.",
      "They also studied how likely it was that a patient\u2019s disease would remain absolutely stable over a period of time.",
      "\u201cOne of the common things we always hear from patients who have Alzheimer\u2019s but are very early in the disease is, \u2018If I could just stay at this level I could get by,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, chief medical and scientific officer at Eli Lilly and Company.",
      "With the new drug, 47 percent of patients stayed stable over the subsequent year compared with 29 percent who took the placebo.",
      "In the Lilly trial, 24 percent of patients had the side effect of brain swelling and bleeding, and 6 percent had symptoms like dizziness, headache or fainting. That is twice the rate observed with Leqembi, the Eisai drug.",
      "But, Dr. Skovronsky said, it is difficult to compare data across trials because the studies had different patient populations \u2014 the Leqembi patients had less severe Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 and different designs. The M.R.I. scans were done on different schedules, and the way the scans are read can vary.",
      "Deaths from brain swelling and bleeding are rare, but still these drugs \u201care not for everyone,\u201d Dr. Petersen said.",
      "\u201cThey do not make you better but they slow the disease,\u201d he said.",
      "Dr. Petersen added that what is really needed is a drug that stops the disease before symptoms arise.",
      "With that goal in mind, Eisai and Lilly are testing their drugs in new studies of people who have large amounts of amyloid in their brains but no symptoms yet of Alzheimer\u2019s.",
      "Advocacy groups applauded the data in the Lilly trial.",
      "George Vradenburg, chairman and co-founder of UsAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s called the donanemab results \u201cexciting news.\u201d Lilly, along with other companies, gives the group general funding but not for any specific project.",
      "In a news release, he said, \u201cTalk to anyone with early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s and they will tell you that living independently and having a higher quality of life for a longer period of time are among the most important things to them.\u201d"

      "But observational data has long suggested that a single dose offers effective protection against HPV for at least a decade. The new results are the first confirmation from a gold-standard clinical trial that a single dose may be as effective as two or three doses, at least over three years.",
      "Results of a direct comparison of one- and two-dose regimens will not be available until 2025.",

      "The scientists collected cervical and vaginal swabs from the women every six months and looked for persistent HPV infection up to 36 months.",
      "The vaccine had an efficacy of 98 percent against the virus subtypes 16 and 18 over three years, and 96 percent against all cancer-causing strains, the study found. No serious side effects were reported.",

      "Programs funded by Gavi have so far reached only about one-third of their goal, in part because of a shortage in vaccine supply. Roughly 20 million doses were available in 2022, Dr. Berkley said, but that number is expected to more than triple by 2025."

      " in JAMA Oncology adds a new twist, finding that while breast density declines with age, a slower rate of decline in one breast often precedes a cancer diagnosis in that breast.",
      "Scientists at Washington University in St. Louis analyzed breast density changes over a 10-year period in 10,000 women who were free of cancer when the study started. Some 289 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in that time; the study compared changes in their breast tissue to those in 658 similar women who did not develop breast cancer.",
      "Breast density was higher from the start in the women who went on to develop breast cancer, and density declined in all women over time. But when each breast\u2019s density was measured separately, scientists found a significantly slower decline in density in breasts that developed cancer, when compared with the other breast in the same patient.",
      "Shu Jiang, the study\u2019s lead author and an associate professor of public health sciences at Washington University, said the findings might provide an individualized and dynamic tool for assessing a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk. \u201cI hope they can get this into clinical use as soon as possible \u2014 it will make a huge difference,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, everybody only looks at density at one point in time,\u201d Dr. Jiang added. But women have mammograms at regular intervals throughout their lives, and the density of each breast is measured each time.",
      "\u201cSo this information is actually already available, but it\u2019s not being utilized,\u201d she said. Now, a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer could \u201cbe updated every time she gets a new mammogram.\u201d",
      "Breast density is now an acknowledged risk factor for breast cancer, albeit one of many. Dense tissue also makes tumors harder to detect in imaging scans.",
      "Dozens of states have started requiring mammography centers to notify women if they have dense breast tissue. In March, the Food and Drug Administration recommended that providers tell women about their breast density.",
      "But this is the first study to measure changes in density over time and to report a link to breast cancer.",
      "Though larger studies will need to be done to confirm the findings, Karen Knudsen, chief executive of the American Cancer Society, called the data \u201cexciting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the first study I\u2019ve seen that looks specifically across time at changes from breast to breast, instead of averaging the two breasts, where you might miss these changes,\u201d Dr. Knudsen said.",
      "Although women are provided the information about breast density and the risks associated with it, the study suggests that information could be better used. \u201cWe need to know how to follow women with dense breasts, instead of just alerting them,\u201d Dr. Knudsen said.",
      "One next step may to be examine breast density over time in women taking medication to prevent breast cancer to see if the density decreases, Dr. Knudsen suggested.",
      "\u201cThere could be different risk stratification guidelines set up to monitor those who are having much slower decline in tissue density, versus those who are not,\u201d Dr. Jiang said."

The eponymous main character, Ponci\u00e1, grows up in a small town, Vila Vic\u00eancio, in a Black family working on a small subsistence farm. Her grandfather had been enslaved. Facing racism, Ponci\u00e1 takes a train to the big city to find a new life. The name of the city is not mentioned, but there is no doubt it is S\u00e3o Paulo.",
      "The S\u00e3o Paulo explored in the literature of the 21st century, as in Evaristo\u2019s novel, is a space in which extreme situations unfold under a regime of oppression directed against those who are outside privileged social groups. This, in a dystopian way, is very well addressed by the writer Ign\u00e1cio de Loyola Brand\u00e3o in his novel \u201c",

      "Another important author for understanding S\u00e3o Paulo, and Brazil, is Carolina Maria de Jesus. Among her books, \u201c",
      ",\u201d in a translation by David St. Clair, stands out. De Jesus was a contemporary of the world-renowned novelist ",
      ", whose works capture that other important Brazilian city, Rio de Janeiro. There is an interesting dialectic between these two great writers that reveals Brazilian subjectivities.",
      "While it may not have the natural beauty of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo is a metropolis where encounters, conviviality and affection are fostered by its parks, theaters, museums, cultural spaces, cinemas, restaurants and bookstores. I cannot imagine S\u00e3o Paulo without the charm of its bookshops.",
      "I live a few yards away from what I consider the best bookstore in town: the ",
      " in Vila Madalena, in the western part of S\u00e3o Paulo. It stocks nearly exclusively books by independent publishers. More than a place that sells books, it\u2019s also a bar where you can find cheap beer and the best pastel de carne, a kind of ",
      " (it\u2019s hard to explain in a few words the magical experience of eating a Brazilian pastel). It is a place where concerts, readings and debates take place. It is where the newest generation of writers, as well as more established and acclaimed writers, can be found.",
      "Another bookstore that deserves your attention is ",

      ", on Avenida Paulista, a major avenue lined with big glass buildings housing banks and cultural centers, has perhaps the largest collection of books by Brazilian authors translated into English, including a great collection of children\u2019s books and art books about Brazil and Brazilian culture written in English.",

The building itself is well worth visiting: It was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, the architect who also designed the country\u2019s capital, Bras\u00edlia, and the United Nations building in New York.

      " only sells books written by women, including Sueli Carneiro, one of the most important Brazilian thinkers, as well as Andr\u00e9a del Fuego, Eliana Alves Cruz and Cidinha da Silva, three of the most celebrated Brazilian writers in recent years. And ",
      ", which is run by the poet Eduardo Lacerda and his wife, Pricila Gunutzmann, belongs to Patu\u00e1, perhaps the most important independent publishing house in Brazil.

      ",\u201d by Micheliny Verunschk, both of which are winners of the Pr\u00eamio S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the three most important literary prizes in Brazil.",
      "Also in the historic center of S\u00e3o Paulo, a few steps from Edif\u00edcio Copan, is the M\u00e1rio de Andrade Library, the first and main public library in the city, which houses an important collection as well as a theater and study and meeting spaces. M\u00e1rio de Andrade was an important Brazilian writer who, among other fundamental works, wrote the foundational work of Brazilian Modernism, the poetry collection \u201c",
      ",\u201d which explores the increasingly urban and chaotic metropolis.",
      "Also close to my house is the Alceu Amoroso Lima Public Library, which is the only large public library in Brazil dedicated exclusively to poetry. There you can find many poetry books by Brazilian authors translated into English \u2014 for example, \u201c",
      ",\u201d by Ang\u00e9lica Freitas, whose work is an example of how some of the best Brazilian poetry today is being written by women and transgender authors. The English translation of the book, by Hilary Kaplan, was a deserving winner in 2016 of the ",
      " given by Three Percent, the literary magazine of Open Letter Books, and the ",
      ", given by the American Literary Translators Association.",
      "Another library that cannot be missed is the ",

      "I can\u2019t talk about S\u00e3o Paulo without mentioning its parks, in particular: Ibirapuera, Villa-Lobos and \u00c1gua Branca. Ibirapuera Park, with its concert venues, planetarium, library, museums and exhibition spaces, is a favorite of residents of the city. If there is time to visit just one of the city\u2019s many parks, make it Ibirapuera.",
      "In Villa-Lobos Park, you\u2019ll find one of the most modern libraries in S\u00e3o Paulo. The park itself is part of an environmental recovery project on the west side of the city.",

You blink and the skyline changes. (Blame the developers.) Even as it grows increasingly apparent that Miami will be gobbled up by the sea, a new wave of transplants is ever en route.",
      "Miami residents who were \u201cmade in Dade\u201d carry their heritage on their sleeves, and it informs their writing beautifully. But some of the best stories set in Miami begin elsewhere: in Puerto Rico and Cuba, the Deep South and New England. I expect this will continue to be the case. Even now, a Californian couple is conceiving the Miami writer who will begin his novel, \u201cMy people escaped Palo Alto.\u201d",

      " The novel follows a New Englander who moves to Florida and gets involved in human trafficking. Meanwhile, in a parallel narrative, a Haitian woman seeks to start a better life in the United States.",
      "The book is ambitious in its attempts to represent the language and attitudes of Haitians, Jamaicans, Cubans and many other Caribbean peoples, alongside Black and white Americans of various social classes. The beauty of the novel \u2014 and perhaps the beauty of Miami \u2014 is how it destabilizes our ideas about who is foreign and who belongs.",

There\u2019s much trauma in these pages, but also much triumph, including in the fact that this book came to exist.

(\u201cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness. \u2026\u201d) Years later, Rosen would read that Ginsberg\u2019s longtime lover Peter Orlovsky, who was there accompanying the poetry on finger cymbals, had once tried to ",
      ".",
      "Behind most performances, in other words \u2014 most lives \u2014 lies some measure of mess and violence, and exposing this can be uncomfortable. But Rosen\u2019s own memoir is the opposite of ruinous. It\u2019s an inch-by-inch, pin-you-to-the-sofa reconstruction of his long friendship with Michael Laudor, who made headlines a decade after the Ginsberg reading: first in The New York Times, as a ",
      "; then pretty much everywhere, after ",
      ", Caroline Costello, to death with a kitchen knife, confusing her with a windup doll.",
      "\u201cFrom Poster Child to Wanted Poster,\u201d Psychiatric Times blared. The New York Post, as only The New York Post can, branded Laudor a \u201cPSYCHO\u201d in typeface more jumbo than the one it had used for the ",
      ". Now Rosen gives us the exquisitely fine print, drawing from clips, court and police records, legal and medical studies, interviews, diaries and some of Laudor\u2019s own feverish compositions, as he examines the porous line between brilliance and insanity and the complicated policy questions posed by deinstitutionalization.",
      "\u201cI grew up surrounded by people who wrote things down,\u201d he notes with understatement, \u201cand wrote things down myself.\u201d",
      "The two men were raised Jewish and bookish in the suburb of New Rochelle, N.Y., advertised on train platforms as \u201cForty-five minutes from Broadway.\u201d It was an incubator to a surprising number of cultural big shots, including E.L. Doctorow, Norman Rockwell, Don McLean and Cynthia Ozick, the author\u2019s mother\u2019s best friend.",
      "\u201cThe same expectation shaping his life was shaping mine,\u201d Rosen writes of Laudor. \u201cThe belief that your brain is your rocket ship and that simply as a matter of course you are going to climb inside and blast off.\u201d",
      "They both aspired to be writers, but Jonathan was always a little in the shadow of Michael, who was only slightly taller but far more confident and popular: reading megafast, \u201c\u2018inhaling\u2019 a page the way he inhaled a pizza,\u201d unafraid of drugs, girls or swimming the entire length of a lake.",

      " and ",

More than one flew over the cuckoo\u2019s nest.",
      "Rosen envied the \u201cjilted, defiant aura\u201d of children affected by divorce and watched as a friend\u2019s father, a psychiatrist who played bass in a band called the Nocturnal Emissions, temporarily abandoned his family to seek spiritual awakening in India.",
      "Overseen by anxious adult intellectuals for whom the Holocaust was a fresh and personal memory, the two youths competed for the editorship of their public school newspaper, attended a \u201cnerd camp\u201d on scholarship and propelled themselves to Yale for college. ",
      "Then their paths forked.",
      "Dryly hilarious on the pretensions of the French deconstructionists then in vogue, Rosen steadied himself studying with ",
      " and proceeded to Berkeley in a 1968 Volvo to pursue a Ph.D. in English literature. Laudor started a job at Bain & Company, the high-pressure management consultancy, to stockpile a cash cushion before beginning his writing career. There, the intensity and imagination he\u2019d always displayed boiled over into paranoia and delusions. A secretary seemed to grow claws and flash bloody teeth; he worried that the phones were tapped and grew convinced his parents had been murdered and replaced by surgically altered Nazis.",
      "\u201cThe break,\u201d as Rosen writes, \u201cwas not orthopedic.\u201d ",
      "Laudor still aced his LSATs. After hospitalization, his pride hurt by a doctor\u2019s suggestion that he try cashiering at Macy\u2019s, he enrolled at Yale\u2019s law school and, in The Times, revealed himself as a \u201cflaming schizophrenic,\u201d quickly lauded as an advocate of mental-health accommodations.",
      "Almost overnight, he had a million-dollar deal with ",
      " and Imagine Entertainment for a movie based on a book he planned to write for Scribner. If \u201cOrdinary People\u201d normalized psychiatric treatment within the context of a traumatized family, this would be, Rosen writes, \u201cExtraordinary People.\u201d ",
      "Laudor\u2019s 80-page book proposal (which Rosen mines, along with another writer\u2019s unfilmed screenplay) was for the power agent Tina Bennett and contained elements of bildungsroman, philosophical treatise, science fiction and spy thriller. But his life, and that of Costello, a gentle supporter and computer whiz who worked in education, would soon tip into bloody horror. Found unfit to stand trial, he was sent to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital.",
      "Rosen cannot release Laudor, but he has rehabilitated and rehumanized him on the page while honoring his victim. \u201cThe Best Minds\u201d is too a thoughtfully built, deeply sourced indictment of a society that prioritizes profit, quick fixes and happy endings over the long slog of care. \u201cIt turned out that going to the moon was easier than curing, preventing or even providing adequate treatment for illnesses that doctors, not so long before, had referred to as lunacy,\u201d he writes, in rueful continuation of the rocket-ship metaphor.",
      "Effectively taking over his friend\u2019s unfinished project, braiding it with his own story of clinical anxiety as well as skeins of history, medicine, religion and true crime, the author has transcended childhood rivalry by twinning their stories, an act of tremendous compassion and a literary triumph.",
      "\u201cEvery review felt like a public colonoscopy,\u201d Rosen writes of his first novel\u2019s reception. In this brave and nuanced book, I could not find so much as a polyp.",

      " is a series exploring the globe through books.",
      "If you arrive in Kerala from elsewhere in India, you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019ve landed in a different country \u2014 \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u201cGod\u2019s own country,\u201d as Keralites like to say.",
      "This strip of coastal territory at India\u2019s southern tip, 350 miles long and 75 miles broad at its widest point, is shaped like a fish, with the head pointing to Sri Lanka, the tail to Goa, and the eyes gazing wistfully west across the Indian Ocean to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia \u2014 the Gulf, or Persia in local parlance.",
      "Think of the Gulf as a Kerala annex, since three million Keralites \u2014 or Malayalis, speakers of Malayalam \u2014 work there; the money they send home makes up about a third of the state\u2019s gross domestic product. Not surprisingly, the Gulf has shaped Kerala\u2019s culture and literature. The territory sits between the Indian Ocean and the Western Ghats, the mountain range that runs parallel to the coast. Forty-four rivers run to the sea, spawning vast lakes, countless streams, lagoons, bottle-green lotus ponds and a latticework of backwaters that are Kerala\u2019s giant circulatory system, with the annual monsoon its beating heart.",
      "Such liquid abundance shapes the lush green landscape dotted with palm trees, and also shapes Malayali character. I think it\u2019s responsible for the fluid facial movements that allow Malayalis to convey volumes without uttering a word.",
      "Kerala\u2019s uniqueness developed in part because the towering Western Ghats sheltered the state from invaders from the north, while the mountains\u2019 fertile slopes allowed spices such as pepper and cardamom to grow wild. For centuries, Arab sailors caught the southwesterlies in the lateen sails of their dhows to come to the \u201cSpice Coast.\u201d When the winds reversed, they carried their purchases of pepper, clove, cardamom, ginger and cinnamon back to Venice or Genoa, where they sold them for small fortunes. Naturally, these sailors kept their source a secret from Europeans.",
      "Expeditions by Westerners in search of these precious spices all failed until Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, landed in present day Kerala in 1498. He was the first; the Portuguese were soon followed by the Dutch, the French and the English.",
      "Books on Kerala\u2019s history can feel tedious. A first-time traveler is better off with a broader introduction to India, like V.S. Naipaul\u2019s incisive and inimitable \u201c",
      "\u201d paired with \u201c",
      "\u201d by Sunil Khilnani. The latter argues that politics, more than culture or religious chauvinism, shaped modern India.",
      "Shashi Tharoor is a wonderful writer, as well as a politician and member of Parliament representing Kerala. His \u201c",
      "\u201d may make a Britisher squirm, but it is a necessary antidote to the romantic falsehood that the British civilized and modernized India, when in fact they built railways, roads and an administrative structure for the sole purpose of efficiently carrying their loot to Indian ports. Even the word \u201cloot\u201d is stolen from Hindi. Britain \u2014 not India \u2014 was modernized and industrialized by the spoils from the \u201cjewel in the crown.\u201d",
      "Inevitably, two centuries of British colonization have left a mark in complex ways, including the irony that many Indian writers \u2014 including Tharoor, and the author of this article \u2014 were educated in schools and universities modeled on the British system, and write and think in English.",
      "In anticipation of the unique and delectable cuisine that awaits you in your travels, read \u201c",
      ",\u201d by Lathika George: a colorful travelogue, memoir and cookbook.",
      "There\u2019s a good chance your inbound flight will connect via Dubai or Doha, because these hubs serve the diaspora with daily flights to Calicut, Cochin or Trivandrum \u2014 cities whose names have been restored to the originals, Kozhikode, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Whatever your route, do read \u201c",
      ",\u201d by Benyamin, which captures the Keralite dream of making a fortune in the Gulf even if that means taking on crippling debt to pay the broker who arranges the visa and the required Arab sponsor. This comic-tragic novel reminds readers that too often the Gulf dream becomes a nightmare of exploitation, deprivation and prolonged separation from family.",
      "Starting in Kozhikode (once known as Calicut) is fitting because it\u2019s where Vasco da Gama landed. Nigel Cliff\u2019s \u201c",
      "\u201d is a detailed account of what was then the longest ocean voyage ever. While in Kozhikode, take a side trip to the vast estates in Wayanad, where some of the grand colonial bungalows have become tourist home-stays or resorts.",
      "Heading south will bring you to Kochi (Cochin), really a conglomeration of islands that includes Ernakulam, Mattancherry, Fort Kochi (Fort Cochin), Willingdon Island, Vypin Island and Gundu Island. You\u2019ll see traces of the Portuguese, Dutch and British; read about them in Tanya Abraham\u2019s \u201c",
      ".\u201d",

      ", the last vestige of a once thriving Jewish community, which is featured in Salman Rushdie\u2019s brilliantly inventive \u201c",
      "\u201d",
      "Take the novel \u201c",
      "\u201d by N. S. Madhavan, with you to the storied Taj Malabar hotel on Willingdon Island; the food is the best, as is the view of the broad sea channel that runs between Vypin Island and Fort Kochi, then to the Arabian Sea. The novel, translated from Malayalam and narrated by Edwina Theresa Irene Maria Anne Margarita Jessica, a girl from a Kerala Catholic community, is a comic romp through history, family, humor, faith and politics.",
      "In the giant spice warehouses, you\u2019ll see sellers and buyers bartering next to mountains of pepper and cloves, much as they did centuries ago in the absence of a common language: by clasping hands under a towel while their concealed fingers convey bids and counter bids, hidden from the other buyers. For further enlightenment, read \u201c",
      "\u201d by Jack Turner. It\u2019s a mystery to me why Europeans in the first sweeping spice craze never thought to pound, dry-roast, then saut\u00e9 these treasures with onions and garlic to make a masala. Instead, they used them as preservatives, to conceal body odors and even, as one zealot championed, to rub on the flaccid male organ, which he swore changed its state and provided endless satisfaction for his partner. (Please don\u2019t try this at home.)",
      "There is no better place to read than on the deck of your own houseboat traveling down shady waterways, while the fish you caught is being prepared in the open-air kitchen at the back of the boat. You\u2019ll likely embark near Kottayam, at the heart of the ",

      "\u201d which won the Booker Prize, gives insights into the setting, Malayali character, casteism and St. Thomas Christians. My most recent novel, \u201c",

      "Short stories are beloved in Kerala, perhaps because they appeared in the earliest periodicals. The short form is well-suited to capturing the plethora of Keralites\u2019 life experiences, and writers in Malayalam discovered minimalism well before Raymond Carver came to it. Even if you are limited to works translated into English, there are many to choose from. My favorites include the master Vaikom Muhammad Basheer\u2019s \u201c",

I stock up at every visit. The chain DC Books seems to be everywhere. For kids, do look for the rich selection of graphic novels and comics that retell classic stories from the Ramayana or from mythology.

      "Old family stories are hard to revivify, even when they\u2019re good family stories. Nothing fades faster, and is more elusive, than the motivations of people who lived a long time ago, unless they were famous enough to leave a churning wake behind them or wrote honest, plucky memoirs of their own.",
      "This is the problem Ava Chin is up against in her sensitive, ambitious, well-reported, heavily peopled yet curiously remote memoir-cum-history, \u201cMott Street: A Chinese American Family\u2019s Story of Exclusion and Homecoming.\u201d It\u2019s a book that has everything going for it except that intangible spark that crisp and confident storytelling throws off. The air is a bit still in this book, as if one is walking behind the docent on a long museum tour.",
      "Chin\u2019s memoir takes its title from the narrow north-south road in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown that\u2019s generally thought of as its Main Street, to which Chin\u2019s family has a long and intricate and prosperous connection. Members of both sides were born, established businesses, ate, drank and died there. Many lived in the same building.",
      "When she\u2019s on Mott Street, Chin feels she\u2019s at home \u2014 except when she feels like an out-and-out alien (she can\u2019t decide) because she and her mother were abandoned by her father and driven from the home place.",
      "Chin grew up in Flushing, Queens, before its Chinese-immigrant population surpassed that of Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. She was a latchkey kid, raised in part by her grandparents. She was among the few Asians in her schools.",
      "She began to sense that there was a side of her family that no one talked about. \u201cMott Street\u201d opens with her meeting her long-distant father, a wealthy lawyer and handsome former politician named Stanley Chin. About him, Chin\u2019s grandmother had told her, \u201cHe used your mother, then threw her away.\u201d",
      "Father and daughter never establish much of a connection, but the author begins to pull other threads of her family\u2019s past and present. A lot of material comes loose.",
      "\u201cMott Street\u201d is a big book that scrutinizes four generations of her family\u2019s life. It has a great deal to say about the Chinese experience in this country: the perilous journeys here, the racism that forced many into menial railroad and laundry jobs, and the draconian Chinese exclusion laws that for six decades (1882-1943) halted most legal immigration and blocked Chinese people from citizenship.",
      "The story has a certain pageantry. It flexes to absorb world wars, cholera epidemics,",
      "the San Francisco earthquake (the loss of official documents in flattened buildings was a boon to many Chinese immigrants), sensational crimes, foot binding and the rise of urban tongs, warring social groups that some would compare to the mafia.",
      "There is a roll call of American politicians who hurt, and helped, the Chinese American cause. There is a great deal of writing about the consolations of food \u2014 the author\u2019s previous book was \u201cEating Wildly: Foraging for Life, Love and the Perfect Meal\u201d (2014) \u2014 and an analysis of how American Jews became so fond of Chinese cuisines. ",
      "There are so many relatives in these pages that readers will find themselves frequently referring to the family tree in front. A few primary faces emerge.",
      "One is Chin On, the author\u2019s paternal great-grandfather, who arrived here in the 1890s. He had swagger, the \u201ckind of arrogance and flair that would later become known as a distinctively Chin quality,\u201d Chin writes.",
      "He was a violent, amoral, heavy-drinking man, a gambling high-roller who owned or co-owned nightclubs and pool halls and opium dens and brothels. Woe to those who borrowed money from him and could not pay it back. One of Chin On\u2019s heavies carried a hatchet and, in Sweeney Todd fashion, was \u201cnever hesitant to turn an enemy of the family into human pork.\u201d The toxic male may be on the run in America, but as dramatis personae he remains a close-to-indispensable spice.",
      "Excellent to read about, too, is Wu Doshim, a maternal relative. Around the turn of the last century he edited The Chinese Reform Weekly News, one of the first Chinese-language newspapers in New York. He had to work linguistic miracles because he had only about 7,000 pieces of metal type in Chinese, while most metropolitan Chinese papers used more than 30,000. He must have felt the way Georges Perec did when he wrote a novel without using the letter \u201ce.\u201d",
      "The women tended to leave less plentiful paper trails, but Chin painstakingly brings several to life. One is Wu Doshim\u2019s wife, Cheung To Chun, who was a member of the darker-skinned and persecuted Hakka ethnic group. Chun experienced racism at the hands of other Chinese Americans,",
      "and lived most her life here undocumented.",
      "Another is Elva Lisk, the white daughter of a Civil War veteran who married into Chin\u2019s maternal family. Elva had both male and female sex organs, Chin writes. Here and throughout the book, Chin places imagined dialogue, in italics, into her text. (There are imagined sex scenes as well.) This dialogue verges on the mawkish: \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "This memoir evokes emotion but, as with the made-up dialogue, Chin sometimes doesn\u2019t trust her readers to absorb it on their own. She dots painful historical scenes with commentary \u2014 \u201cdrives me bonkers,\u201d \u201cI want to throttle the immigration officers,\u201d \u201cI am grieving\u201d \u2014 after these moments have already spoken plainly.",
      "\u201cMott Street\u201d takes us to the present moment. She recalls the American president who referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cKung Flu\u201d and \u201cChina virus.\u201d She charts the uptick in anti-Asian violence in the United States, and she writes about her life in New York City, and her new fear of subways:",
      "These days, I only travel aboveground.",
      "I carry a flashlight with me at all times, and I wear only shoes and clothing that I can run in, or drop-kick someone in, if attacked.",
      "I practice my squats and my daily push-ups on the ferry to my studio to strengthen my arms and my core, and I advise other Asians to do the same. (I even started a self-defense group, Sisters in Self-Defense, with artist Alison Kuo in order to help community members learn how to protect themselves.)",
      "She and her vibrant family have come so far, but a lot of the old bruises are still right there on the surface.",

      ", by Katy Kelleher",
      "Activities that we tend to think of as distinctly human often have nothing to do with immediate survival. We brush paint on canvases, we play tunes on instruments, we imagine a world that doesn\u2019t exist and read about the fictitious people who live there. But sometimes the human pursuit of joy and pleasure can create destruction. We have a hard time abiding by the concept of enough. We recklessly and relentlessly chase things we want but do not need.",
      "In \u201cThe Ugly History of Beautiful Things,\u201d Katy Kelleher writes about the extreme and sometimes hideous lengths that people have gone to in order to obtain coveted objects of beauty: ruining their health, wrecking the planet, inflicting suffering on others. As someone with a history of depression that has entailed self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she says that beauty has helped provide the purpose to keep her going: \u201cThe hope for beauty makes me leave my bed each morning rather than moldering in the sheets until I develop bedsores.\u201d",
      "Yet the beauty she seeks is also tied up with feelings of guilt. \u201cI\u2019ve never found an object that was untouched by the depravity of human greed or unblemished by the chemical undoings of time,\u201d Kelleher writes. She buys trinkets and generates garbage. A journalist who writes about home and design, she realizes that it has been her job to encourage others to do the same.",
      "Thankfully, this book isn\u2019t her penance \u2014 it\u2019s more surprising and ambivalent than that, and there isn\u2019t any scolding here, even if some of what she recounts is disturbing and truly horrific. Kelleher points out that an element of ugliness can be part of an object\u2019s appeal, distinguishing between the intriguingly beautiful and the boringly pretty. There is, of course, the Japanese notion of wabi-sabi, which holds that imperfection can be a reminder of life\u2019s impermanence and contingency; a decaying flower might convey another layer of experience that a fresh bloom won\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t explicitly mention Japanese aesthetics, but a chapter on the Nazi fetish for gleaming white porcelain had me rereading Tanizaki\u2019s \u201cIn Praise of Shadows,\u201d in which he writes about wanting a toilet made of black lacquered wood.",
      "But an ugly history is different. Knowledge of it can detract from an object\u2019s allure even as it signals the object\u2019s desirability \u2014 making it glaringly clear how rare something is, and therefore how scarcity has helped to determine its value. In the 19th century, an orchid hunter might have been eaten by a tiger or disappeared forever somewhere in the jungle thicket. During the Renaissance, Venetian glassmakers often worked with toxic materials like lead and mercury; those who didn\u2019t go mad from the vapors or die from mysterious stomach ailments would still have to worry about being assassinated by glassmaking rivals or, should they try to emigrate, by their autocratic rulers.",
      "The mirrors that these glassmakers so painstakingly created have since achieved the status of mass-produced goods, part of a system that has eliminated some hazards while generating others. Mirrors used to be rare and prized enough to be associated with scrying and magic; now, Kelleher laments, they\u2019re so common that they\u2019re taken for granted, or else derided as mere objects of vanity instead of marvelous contraptions that allowed for the \u201csense of awe\u201d that comes with seeing oneself.",
      "Kelleher organizes her book by object, with chapters on gemstones (shadowed by violence), on makeup (shadowed by toxicity), on perfume (shadowed by animal excretions), among others. She has a knack for nimbly threading together her own memories and tastes with the histories of the objects themselves. She doesn\u2019t want cruelty in her goods, and so she fills vases with foraged greenery and buys a silk dress secondhand. \u201cI wanted to feel a fabric that skims over my skin like breeze,\u201d she explains. \u201cHave you ever slipped a silk robe around your body and felt it brush against your nipples?\u201d",
      "Most people in the world would undoubtedly answer no; silk is still a luxury good, even if it\u2019s been made more accessible by exploitative labor practices. Kelleher wrestles with some of these knotty issues, though her enthusiasm is most palpable when she is writing about the goods themselves. We yearn for beautiful things that give us sensual pleasure \u2014 that seems obvious enough. But a luxury good \u201cwas never intended to be available to everyone,\u201d she writes \u2014 that also seems obvious. So what are the implications of this? Not everyone who wants to feel the caress of a silk robe can afford it, especially if it\u2019s ethically made. Should you rein in your desires? Or does that amount to letting the elite off the hook: They do what they wish, while the rest of us make do with what we can get?",
      "It\u2019s a lot of pressure to put on a flimsy robe, but as Kelleher knows, you can\u2019t write about this stuff without at least gesturing at the bigger stuff: existence and mortality, capitalism and consumption. By the end of the book, she comes to a d\u00e9tente with her own yearning. She recognizes that she can appreciate beauty without possessing it \u2014 she can take her daughter to the beach and make mandalas out of shell fragments; she can go for a walk and spot a monarch butterfly in a field or a pink orchid in a bog. But she admits that she still longs for a fantasy home with marble countertops and slate tiles, even if her conscience and her bank account make it an impossibility.",
      "\u201cEach beauty I find will fade, degrade, break and tarnish,\u201d Kelleher writes, \u201cand there\u2019s no point in asking for what I can\u2019t have.\u201d",

      "On Feb. 13, 2014, a bored-at-work BuzzFeed quiz ricocheted around the web: \u201c",
      "\u201d",
      "The \u201cactually\u201d seemed to promise a solid, data-driven answer.",
      "You remember how these quizzes work. Select a party anthem (\u201cYMCA\u201d), a quality in a dream partner (\u201cravenous\u201d) and presto: your spiritual home. These quizzes were plenty diverting, and in the early days people shared them like joints or sparklers.",
      "But this particular quiz had a bug. Too many people got Wyoming \u2014 more than actually lived in Wyoming \u2014 and this turn of events was so exciting that people stomped over to Facebook to protest. Then, according to Ben Smith in his engrossing and suspenseful book, \u201cTraffic: Genius, Rivalry, and Delusion in the Billion-Dollar Race to Go Viral,\u201d the team at BuzzFeed noticed something that changed media forev \u2014",
      "Well, not ",
      ". This is Ben Smith, after all. Man-about-media, ironist by nature and trade. Co-founder of Semafor, former New York Times media columnist, onetime editor in chief of BuzzFeed News. In unfolding the tale of Gawker, HuffPost and BuzzFeed \u2014 the new-media ventures that, he argues, conspired to invent virality \u2014 Smith largely resists the temptation to claim that anything in his experience changed the world forever. That\u2019s for Silicon Valley hagiographies. \u201cTraffic\u201d is instead a picaresque, set among the muckrakers, Jezebels, dweebs, addicts and wing nuts of Silicon Alley, the notional New York City tech zone that runs, in theory, from Flatiron to Dumbo.",
      "But even as Smith refuses to canonize his protagonists, Nick Denton (the founder of Gawker Media) and Jonah Peretti (the co-founder of HuffPost and BuzzFeed), they occasionally alight on the odd eureka moment that a more earnest writer could have styled as world-changing. Sometimes Smith even becomes that earnest writer: \u201cWe were inventing digital media,\u201d he writes of BuzzFeed.",
      "The Wyoming quiz\u2019s eureka moment belonged to Peretti. When the quiz became BuzzFeed\u2019s most successful post, Peretti, then the company\u2019s chief executive, pinged a Facebook staffer, who explained that the platform had a new algorithm for promoting posts: Facebook was now pushing content that attracted high engagement numbers, and a comment carried four times the weight of a \u201clike.\u201d Lazy, bemused clicks were yesterday\u2019s metrics; the platform wanted garrulous comment sections. A cortisol-spiking post that made hordes of reply guys shriek \u201cWyoming!\u201d? Facebook blasted it to everyone. Two years later, the same thing would happen with posts that made users shriek \u201cTrump!\u201d",
      "Smith depicts Denton and Peretti as rivals, but they\u2019re not playing precisely the same game. With Gawker, which began in 2002, Denton was seeking to bust up traditional media with blogs that tweaked the high hats in a \u201cfaster, truer version of reality.\u201d He mastered \u201cthe refresh,\u201d according to Smith; people kept a Gawker tab open all day and compulsively checked for updates.",
      "At HuffPost, which started as The Huffington Post in 2005, and then BuzzFeed, which joined the scene in 2006, Peretti was directing and redirecting the surges of online influence \u2014 traffic \u2014 that he had taught himself how to manipulate as a graduate student at M.I.T. He was also conducting moral experiments, trying to determine whether all this traffic should, or could, be pressed into the service of \u201cactivism, politics, business or simply fun.\u201d",
      "Denton came to New York from San Francisco in 2002 with an air of what Smith calls \u201ccasual cruelty\u201d and a conviction that \u201cblogging was the future.\u201d Joining forces with the journalist Elizabeth Spiers, Denton swept up astute writers like Jessica Coen and Emily Gould and tasked them with zinging the rich and famous on his new platform, Gawker. For years, the site smote its enemies with an energy both sporting and bloodthirsty only to find itself defeated in the 2010s by two formidable forces: the right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel, and love.",
      "Thiel, who, according to Smith\u2019s account, despised Denton for once calling him \u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cparanoid,\u201d ",
      " a lawsuit over Gawker\u2019s ",
      " that pushed the website into bankruptcy. But in Smith\u2019s amused telling, what really drained the battery of the Gawker project was that Denton fell in love with Derrence Washington, now his husband. The romance, Smith suggests, dampened his personal spikiness and his taste for unalloyed snark.",
      "Peretti, for his part, joined Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart and Kenneth Lerer to start The Huffington Post, which was first conceived as a progressive alternative to The Drudge Report. Fresh out of the M.I.T. Media Lab, Peretti deployed his wizardry in conjuring traffic to drive a hodgepodge website to box-office glory. It was ",
      ". for $315 million in 2011.",
      "Peretti then jumped to full time at the other company he\u2019d helped start, BuzzFeed,just as Smith took over as editor in chief of BuzzFeed News. By the time the Wyoming quiz hit peak virality, Peretti was in close contact with Facebook while Smith, who had come to BuzzFeed from Politico, was brooding about how to attract traffic to political reporting.",
      "The showdown between BuzzFeed and Gawker is best understood as a contest of attitudes. BuzzFeed in its early years was all Disney princesses, cute pets and ",
      ", while Gawker had put its chips on tabloid-style expos\u00e9s and spite. Politico recorded a ",
      " war of ",
      " And unlike New York literary battles past \u2014 Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal, anyone? \u2014 this one could be decisively won. By the numbers. Gawker would sneer, BuzzFeed would coo and the winner would be the post to attract the most clicks, views, likes, shares, comments and, of course, complaints.",
      "Anna Holmes, the founder of Jezebel, Gawker Media\u2019s women-focused site, appears frequently in \u201cTraffic,\u201d but she deserves a biography of her own. Not only did she create a juggernaut, starting in 2007 \u2014 ",
      " \u2014 but she savaged, without apology, both ",
      " and workaday sexism, including disturbingly photoshopped images of women\u2019s bodies. With Jezebel, and in spite of Denton\u2019s initial incomprehension, Holmes and her staff invented an unsparing house style that has become the idiom of modern American feminism.",
      "Smith finally got his own taste of viral fame in 2017, when he opted, controversially, to publish the so-called Steele dossier, documenting supposed collusion with Russian agents by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and filled with salacious details about Trump\u2019s escapades in Russia. Smith ",
      ". But when its ",
      ", he wrung his hands. Can viral political content ever be valuable political content \u2014 and vice versa?",
      "Anxiety about this question haunts Smith, and this moral seriousness is what lifts \u201cTraffic\u201d above other accounts of adventures in start-up land. The most cinematic treachery in \u201cTraffic\u201d turns out to have been pulled off not by Peretti\u2019s traffic apparatus or by Denton\u2019s cruelty factory but by the figures who play Igors to their Frankensteins. These include Peretti\u2019s Huffington Post co-founder Breitbart, who went on to create the far-right website Breitbart.com; Benny Johnson, whom Smith hired at BuzzFeed and then fired (for extensive plagiarism) and who now works for the conservative youth group Turning Point USA; and an alt-right stuntman known as Baked Alaska, who quit a job at BuzzFeed to work as a \u201ctour manager\u201d for the right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos and was ",
      " in the Jan. 6 insurrection. (On April 20, Peretti announced that BuzzFeed would be ",
      ", part of a broader downsizing at the company.)",
      "What, in the end, did these pioneers of Silicon Alley invent? A way to \u201cmeasure culture,\u201d Smith writes. He then defines \u201cculture\u201d as \u201cthe volume of outrage or the success of a joke.\u201d Indignation and laughter.",
      "This modern conception of culture jostles in my mind alongside Matthew Arnold\u2019s still seductive notion that culture is beauty and intelligence \u2014 \u201csweetness and light.\u201d The jostling feels by turns productive and abrasive.",

      "\u201cMen put me down as the best woman painter,\u201d Georgia O\u2019Keeffe once said. \u201cI think I\u2019m one of the best painters.\u201d That famous quote by the American modernist serves as an epigraph in Part 2 of the Guardian",
      "columnist Katy Hessel\u2019s sweeping first book, \u201cThe Story of Art Without Men.\u201d \u201cWomen artists are not a trend,\u201d Hessel maintains; and yet the contested category persists, not as a meaningful distinction but rather as a repercussion of patriarchy, a category that the male-dominated art world consistently, in O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s terms, diminishes.",
      "Part revisionist history, part coffee-table book, part collective portrait, part archival treasure hunt, Hessel\u2019s treatise covers the 1500s to the present in an attempt to make good on its title. But despite her best efforts, men can\u2019t help appearing throughout, as rich husbands, abusive boyfriends, artist fathers, needy sons, muse-hungry painters, institutions and even that supreme male gaze, God\u2019s.",
      "In this 500-page tome, Hessel, who cites her Instagram account @thegreatwomenartists as part of the book\u2019s origin, efficiently introduces us to a mosaic of artists, from the well-known Artemisia Gentileschi, Frida Kahlo, Hilma af Klint, Tracey Emin and Kara Walker to the lesser-known Elisabetta Sirani, Marie Denise Villers and Lady Butler, and even gestures toward the multitude of names that we might never know.",
      "The book\u2019s chronological and compendium-like structure allows for an abundance of \u201cfirsts\u201d: Lavinia Fontana is \u201cthought to be one of the first women in Western art to paint female nudes,\u201d in 1595; Alma Thomas is \u201cthe first African American woman to achieve a solo exhibition at the Whitney,\u201d in 1972; \u201cA Lesbian Show\u201d was \u201cthe first all-lesbian art show in the U.S.,\u201d in New York City in 1978; the 20th-century Mexican artist Aurora Reyes Flores is considered \u201cthe first female Muralist\u201d; and so on. The result is an engaging but necessarily clipped perspective. Through her narrative form and focus on representation, Hessel\u2019s lineage of milestones obscures both the political history behind women\u2019s exclusion from the canon and the possibility of struggle against it.",
      "Hessel\u2019s target audience is \u201canyone of any art-historical level interested in learning the stories of these mostly overshadowed artists.\u201d It is unsurprising, then, that her survey \u2014 which includes roughly 300 images, a glossary of art-historical terminology and a six-page timeline of artists from the Dutch Golden Age to the Harlem Renaissance to today \u2014 favors the global over the local. ",
      "From the beginning Hessel warns that \u201cthis is not a definitive history \u2014 it would be an impossible task,\u201d and acknowledges the challenges of her broad-stroked approach: the complications of fitting individuals into sanctioned aesthetic movements; the sensitivities around the vexed category of \u201cwoman artists,\u201d which for Hessel is no longer a \u201cderogatory\u201d term but \u201can embodiment of power\u201d; and the ever-evolving status of these distinctions in our present and future.",
      "But although her index of names succeeds in providing some answer to the question posed in Linda Nochlin\u2019s trailblazing 1971 essay \u201cWhy Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,\u201d Hessel does less than Nochlin did, 50 years ago, to unsettle the terms of the question itself. Can inserting women into the art-historical canon interrupt the system of canonization itself? Why does Hessel rely on the same methods of archival organization \u2014 linear history, market-based tastes, distinct genre boundaries \u2014 that played a part in producing women\u2019s very exclusion? How instead might the fact of women\u2019s presence disrupt the presuppositions of art\u2019s place in the world?",
      "An especially moving chapter, \u201cThe Body in Sculpture,\u201d initiates an answer. Here Hessel examines the midcentury sculpture of Eva Hesse, itself \u201cdifficult to describe,\u201d and the performance art of Yoko Ono (\u201ca genre defined by risk-taking\u201d), and their engagements with the body\u2019s virtues and grotesqueness, providing context for second-wave feminism\u2019s focus on sexual violence and reproductive politics.",
      "\u201cHow, through the power of art,\u201d Hessel asks, \u201ccan you make people feel the visceral sensation of a body that has been hurt or scrutinized, idealized, or wrought with scars of barely comprehensible histories?\u201d",
      "Hessel also underscores how many of the artists in \u201cThe Story of Art Without Men\u201d have been denied access to education, funding, gallery representation, media attention, attribution and even participation in public life. They have died poor, depressed, institutionalized or simply unknown. No book could repair those wrongs \u2014 but especially not one that remains concerned with indexing and inclusivity, rather than with a broader and more fervent social critique.",

Early in Justin Cronin\u2019s new novel, Proctor Bennett, the titular ferryman, attends a piano recital and finds the experience akin to \u201cwatching someone perfectly hammer nails into a board.\u201d This aesthetic judgment arrives with all the force of a consciousness-changing epiphany.",

There\u2019s something mildly intoxicating, in fact, about entering this utopia, called Prospera, because Cronin\u2019s shrewd world-building allows us to have it both ways: We sink into aspirational fantasy even as we relish the author\u2019s sly commentary on a certain species of coastal elite.

Rather than undergo the indignities of birth and death, old or infirm Prosperans are sent by ferry to a mysterious island called the Nursery, where their memories are wiped and their bodies rejuvenated, so they can return as hale 16-year-olds with new identities.",
      "Unlike most Prosperans, Proctor \u2014 42 years old, comfortably married, proud civil servant \u2014 dreams in his sleep. But after a disastrous incident that occurs when Proctor escorts his own aging father to the ferry, his dreams become indistinguishable from reality, and his respectable life begins to disintegrate. \u201cYou\u2019re not \u2026 ",

      "His new sense of estrangement draws him to Thea, the only person who acknowledges how awful the art on Prospera is. She in turn draws Proctor into the Annex, the neighboring island inhabited by Prospera\u2019s servant class, where a blind painter creates canvases that evoke \u201ca more authentic reality, the true shape of the world\u201d \u2014 good art, in other words \u2014 whose images happen to match the ones in Proctor\u2019s dreams.

      "Before Cronin splashed onto the best-seller list with the ",
      ", a maximalist ",
      " about rampaging vampires, he wrote \u201cquiet\u201d literary fiction centered on New England couples and summer camps in Maine. \u201cThe Ferryman\u201d is an intriguing blend of both modes. It\u2019s a careful book with a limited cast, animated by the bonds of parental and romantic love. An undercurrent of grief, organized around a pure, almost unobjectionable family tragedy, forms the book\u2019s emotional core, and the scenes of fatherly doting that recur throughout are so pitch-perfect that they verge at times on treacle. At the same time, the plot features car chases, shootouts, the infiltration of a government building and a twist that completely alters the frame of the story precisely two-thirds of the way through.",
      "Occasionally, the seams show. Cronin\u2019s prose is mostly lucid and considered, but certain patches of overwriting read like attempts to inject unnecessary grandeur into the proceedings. One woman leads her husband to bed as a final farewell: \u201cHer body would say to him the things that words could not.\u201d Proctor, in nearly all respects a generic everyman, has an unfortunate habit of bursting into rhapsodic apostrophe. \u201cWater, life-giving treasure of the universe!\u201d he thinks at one point. \u201cWhat fantastical creatures must teem within your depths, what wonders lurk beneath your storm-tossed waves!\u201d",
      "Storm-tossed waves crop up again and again in this novel, which is drenched with references to \u201cThe Tempest\u201d: freak squalls, an enchanted island, the name Prospera. Prospero\u2019s monologues are even quoted directly in the book\u2019s latter half. The twist, after an initial ",
      " of insight, is disappointingly reminiscent of more than one blockbuster sci-fi movie released in the past two decades, and Cronin\u2019s methodical explanations still aren\u2019t enough to quell lingering questions about how exactly it all works.",
      "But his nods to Shakespeare hint at bigger themes. The idea of a benevolent puppet master echoes through \u201cThe Ferryman,\u201d from the godlike Designer who created Prospera to the Great Soul worshiped by the Arrivalists. Shakespeare\u2019s Prospero, we understand, is a similar figure, creating illusions that hold the other characters in sway, the god of his own little island. By the end of \u201cThe Ferryman,\u201d Proctor and Prospero and Cronin and Shakespeare are all linked, and the novel becomes meta-commentary on the creative act itself. When one character muses, at a climactic moment, that perhaps \u201call creation was boxes within boxes within boxes, each the dream of a different god,\u201d one imagines Cronin giving the reader a broad wink.",
      "Some may find this idea profound; I found it deflating. Those early suggestions about the relationship between \u201creal life\u201d and the creation of good art seem, in this light, to be a useful plot device rather than a proposal about how our own world might work. If in the end everything is just \u201cboxes within boxes,\u201d how much meaning does the notion of \u201creal life\u201d even hold?",
      "But maybe this is asking too much of a story meant to engross and entertain, which its satisfying epilogue, in particular, does in spades. The novel delivers everything you\u2019d want from your nightly dreams: an anodyne, occasionally beautiful diversion, rife with patterns and the suggestion of deeper truth that vanishes as soon as you lift your eyes from the last page.",

      "Well, somebody was going to do it. In truth, other hustlers out there on Amazon already have. But \u201cDeath of an Author\u201d is arguably the first halfway readable A.I. novel, an early glimpse at what is vectoring toward readers. It has been presided over by a literate writer who has pushed the borg in twisty directions. He got it to spit out more than boilerplate, some of the time.

      "The book has metafictional zest. It\u2019s about a well-known Canadian writer named Peggy Firmin, who vaguely resembles Margaret Atwood.

      " by Abraham Verghese",
      "Abraham Verghese occupies a curious place in the modern literary landscape. A doctor who decided midcareer to train at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, he has gone on to achieve distinction in both fields. He is a professor of the theory and practice of medicine at Stanford Medical School, continues in clinical practice, has won the National Humanities Medal, speaks widely about the importance of the human element of what has become a technocratic practice, and has won awards for both fiction and nonfiction. His last novel, \u201cCutting for Stone,\u201d spent more than two years on this newspaper\u2019s best-seller list.",
      "It is tempting to look at him as a man with multiple careers running in tandem, but all his work is anchored in a consistent, profound moral architecture of the spirit. He suffered considerably when he was younger \u2014 experiences he has chronicled in his earlier fiction and nonfiction \u2014 and emerged a romantic, determined to be kind and extravagantly compassionate, a genuine humanist. In an era when seriousness is often presumed to entail skepticism, he is serious about benevolence. By projecting his own best self, he hopes to coax out the best selves of others.",
      "It is hard to operate consistently on such high principles, harder still to explain them to others, and hardest of all to demand that others rise to them. The modesty of ostentatiously kindhearted people can come off as smug, and in his public statements, Verghese occasionally assumes a bothersome tone of condescension. His new novel, \u201cThe Covenant of Water,\u201d focuses almost entirely on good people (to whom many terrible things happen), and given the complexity of human beings, the surfeit of grace sometimes feels unrealistic and even pretentious, as though the writer is affiliating himself with standards that ordinary humans cannot attain. The lack of ill intent or even ambivalence among the book\u2019s many heroes can become cloying. This is not a novel endowed with subtle psychological insights, and it is devoid of humor: on the part of the characters or about them.",
      "It is, however, grand, spectacular, sweeping and utterly absorbing. ",
      " has a gift for suspense, and his easy relationship to language draws you through the narrative so effortlessly that you hardly realize you are plowing through decade upon decade and page upon page. The book begins in 1900, as a 12-year-old girl in what is now the state of Kerala, in southwest India, prepares for an unwanted arranged marriage. It ends in 1977, when that girl\u2019s physician granddaughter arrives at a shocking discovery. The family are Indian Christians, descendants of those first converted by St. Thomas in the first century A.D. They lead tough but often joyful lives, and they gradually make their way up in the world despite impossible-looking challenges. A plot synopsis would take a hundred pages and spoil the fun, but let it be known that this family loves and suffers in a cavalcade of ways.",
      "The tone of the book is sometimes pedagogical: There are a lot of doctors here, and we learn in rather fine detail about surgical procedures, anatomical constructions and medical interventions. Verghese\u2019s writing about all things medical is particularly adroit; his profound understanding of the human body is perhaps his greatest strength. Even if the personalities of the numerous physicians are not fully rounded, their identities as doctors are. We also learn a great deal about India, some of which we might already have known: the caste system; the social upheavals of the 20th century; a variety of foods; information about architecture, farming and family structure; the place of faith in the society; the eventual move toward socialism.",
      "Like Amy Tan\u2019s \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d which catered to a voyeuristic interest in Asia by selecting its most accessibly endearing characteristics, this novel recalls the curry one might get in a small American farm town: exotic by local standards, not wrong in any way, but substantially softened for the locals. Some of the exposition can seem almost patronizing to a more worldly reader. The view of India does not achieve the plangent intimacy that, for example, Vikram Seth achieves in \u201cA Suitable Boy.\u201d This is populist writing, ambitious in plot but not in character, and populated with archetypes rather than people. So, in many ways, was the work of Charles Dickens, whose crackling but now rather historical method of storytelling may be among Verghese\u2019s inspirations.",
      "Yet why should we assume that sophistication requires cynicism? Sometimes it is satisfying when good things happen to good people, when the nastiness that has tended to reap rewards in the harsh world of modern fiction takes a break. People may not be as good as Verghese\u2019s characters, but neither are they as bad as Philip Roth\u2019s or Saul Bellow\u2019s. Ugliness is not truer than loveliness, nor cruelty more so than kindness. Sometimes, the world\u2019s insults are simple ones: a child who dies, a fire, a disease, a flood. There is pungent truth outside of malice.",
      "This book may follow \u201cCutting for Stone\u201d onto the best-seller list and stay there for a long time. It does not present the dark and fantastical complexity of India limned by Salman Rushdie in \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children,\u201d and its occasional gestures toward the mystical feel contrived. Still, it will expose people without much connection to South Asian culture to beauties to which they might otherwise not have access. In a period of divisiveness, racism and anti-Asian hate, that is as important an accomplishment as changing our understanding of what fiction can do, or explaining how the world\u2019s largest democracy came to elect Narendra Modi, or delving into the anti-Islamic face of Hindu nationalism. The arranged marriage that begins the book is a happy one; many are not, and the status of women in rural India remains often problematic; that should not, however, undermine the reality that such marriages succeed at least as often as those predicated on romance.",
      "The trick is to read the book not as realism, but as a fable. The impetus to write it began with a notebook that Verghese\u2019s mother wrote for an inquisitive granddaughter, and the earlier parts of \u201cThe Covenant of Water\u201d have the soothing haze of sentimental recollection. Even as the book moves toward more recent times, when Verghese himself was alive, and begins to express some awareness of a troubled world, its plot is so thick with extremes and unlikely coincidences, so highly wrought, so dense with drama, that it doesn\u2019t feel real. But it doesn\u2019t need to. Verghese has given us entry to Cochin and Travancore as they once existed or never did, and to a family whose saga is full of grief and yet oddly reassuring.",
      "The great novels about India by Indian expatriates are often traumatic to read. This one is not a literary accomplishment at the level of Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s \u201cThe Namesake\u201d or Arundhati Roy\u2019s \u201cThe God of Small Things\u201d; nonetheless, I would happily spend months on end with it and I cried when it was done. While I don\u2019t entirely believe in Verghese\u2019s characters, I am moved by how much he loves them and, in so doing, makes the reader love them. At this moment, I am longing to go to Kerala; I am as nostalgic for Big Ammachi as I am for my own grandmother. It is a better world for having a book in it that chronicles so many tragedies in a tone that never deviates from hope.",

      ", he was issuing a call to the far-right fringe that was earsplitting, even by his own standards. It wasn\u2019t simply the location but also the timing: a month shy of the 30th anniversary of ",
      " \u2014 a date that marked the fiery, deadly end of the 51-day standoff between the F.B.I. and David Koresh at his Branch Davidian compound near Waco.",
      "Along with the standoff at ",
      ", in 1992, Waco became a galvanizing moment for the radical right. Exactly two years later, on the morning of ",
      ", Timothy McVeigh drove a Ryder truck loaded with a 7,000-pound fertilizer bomb to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. He lit the fuse, parked the truck and walked to his getaway car in a nearby alley. The blast sheared off the front third of the building, killing 167 people, 19 of them children. (Another victim, a rescue worker, was killed by falling debris.) Among the dead were 15 preschoolers who had just started their morning at the day care center on the second floor.",
      "After white nationalists helped put Trump in the White House, McVeigh\u2019s attack was featured in books by ",
      " and ",
      ", who have convincingly depicted Oklahoma City as both a culmination and a turning point. McVeigh was a decorated veteran of Operation Desert Storm who drew his bombing plans directly from ",
      " a 1978 novel by a neo-Nazi that narrated a lurid fantasy of race war. He referred to his attack as a \u201cmilitary action\u201d and attended militia meetings. Contrary to media portrayals of him at the time, McVeigh wasn\u2019t just some lone-wolf drifter or survivalist oddball. He was steeped in an ideology; he was motivated by a political movement.",
      "Jeffrey Toobin\u2019s \u201cHomegrown\u201d adds to this chorus, but where those other books contain a chapter on Oklahoma City, the entirety of Toobin\u2019s book is given over to McVeigh and the ensuing trials. Toobin covered the legal proceedings for The New Yorker, and he admits that like other journalists he got caught up in \u201cthe trail of evidence presented in the courtroom,\u201d instead of stepping back to grasp McVeigh\u2019s \u201cplace in the broader slipstream of American history.\u201d",
      "Part of the reason, he suggests, lies with how the government decided to prosecute the case \u2014 or, more specifically, how Merrick Garland, the official sent by the Justice Department to supervise the case, decided to prosecute it. Garland was so intent on pruning away anything resembling \u201cclutter\u201d that \u201cthe idea took hold that the bombing was just about Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols,\u201d McVeigh\u2019s co-conspirator.",
      "The first half of the book recounts the events leading up to the bombing in Toobin\u2019s unfussy prose. We read about McVeigh\u2019s \u201ctroubled, but hardly extraordinary upbringing\u201d near Buffalo \u2014 divorced parents (\u201chis rage at his mother was intense\u201d), a father whose job at a radiator plant became increasingly precarious. Toobin describes an arrogant, lonely kid who constantly deflected responsibility, loath to own up to his failures. By the time he met Nichols during basic training in 1988, McVeigh had already found the two things that would provoke in him a fanatical devotion: \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d and guns.",
      "McVeigh would go on to become a regular at gun shows, eventually cajoling Nichols into robbing a dealer so that they could fund their bombing plot. Oklahoma City would be their response to Ruby Ridge, to Waco, to the assault weapons ban of 1994. (McVeigh compared the ban to \u201cthe Cohen Act,\u201d the gun control law in \u201cThe Turner Diaries.\u201d) In other words, the federal government made them do it: McVeigh, who wanted to take credit for the attack while also wanting to be acquitted, at one point urged his legal team to pursue a \u201cnecessity defense\u201d by arguing that the bombing was done to prevent greater harm.",
      "\u201cThe argument was worse than nonsensical,\u201d Toobin writes. \u201cIt was offensive.\u201d McVeigh\u2019s lawyers recognized as much. But all kinds of absurd ideas were entertained by the members of his legal team because they had an essentially unlimited budget, at government expense; the procedure-obsessed Garland wanted to pre-empt any criticism that McVeigh\u2019s right to a robust defense had been compromised.",
      "\u201cHomegrown\u201d repeatedly draws a \u201cdirect line\u201d (as promised on the jacket copy) between the Oklahoma City bombing and the insurrection on Jan. 6; at multiple points Toobin interrupts his brisk narrative with some galumphing sentences reminding the reader of parallels that are glaringly obvious. The more intriguing parts of the book come from his descriptions of all the legal wrangling, much of it informed by 635 boxes of case files donated by Stephen Jones, McVeigh\u2019s showboating attorney, to the University of Texas in 1999. Toobin describes how the lawyer and his client grew to dislike and mistrust each other. After McVeigh criticized Jones in \u201cAmerican Terrorist,\u201d a book by two Buffalo News reporters, Jones claimed \u201ca right to defend himself by disclosing his client\u2019s confidences.\u201d",
      "Still, the lawyer who interests Toobin most is Garland \u2014 another point in the \u201cdirect line\u201d between Oklahoma City and Jan. 6. Back then, Garland was a top official in the Justice Department; now, of course, he is the attorney general of the United States. Toobin, ",
      ", calls him \u201ca reticent, cautious person\u201d who was haunted by the \u201cundignified spectacle\u201d of the O.J. Simpson trial (which Toobin wrote a ",
      " about).",
      "Vowing that the Oklahoma City trials would never devolve into silly theatrics, Garland wanted the case to hew as closely to McVeigh and Nichols as possible. So the prosecution \u201cactively discouraged the idea that McVeigh and Nichols represented something broader \u2014 and more enduring \u2014 than just their own malevolent behavior,\u201d Toobin writes. \u201cThis was a dangerously misleading impression.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if Toobin were addressing his book to Garland, as a cautionary tale, even if Garland\u2019s legal strategy in Oklahoma ultimately proved successful: McVeigh was ",
      " and executed in June 2001; Nichols was sentenced to ",
      ".",
      "Besides, if Merrick Garland had sounded an alarm, would that really have had a transformative effect on the American public? Even Toobin has to concede that the 1990s felt like a very different time: \u201cAmerica was thriving, so how could McVeigh be anything except a regrettable oddity in this moment of national repose?\u201d The fringe was still the fringe \u2014 it was too extreme, too weird, too atomized to coalesce into anything that could get its hands on actual power. Social media didn\u2019t exist; Trump was still known primarily for his florid love life and gaudy casinos. Chilling what-ifs have since become routine facts in our warped reality: \u201cMcVeigh would talk about his belief that an \u2018Army\u2019 of fellow believers was somewhere out there, but he admitted that he never figured out how to reach them.\u201d",

      ", by Thomas Melle. Translated by Luise Von Flotow.",
      "Living with bipolar disorder \u2014 formerly called manic depression \u2014 is hard enough, but memoirists afflicted with it face an additional quandary: how to turn their bizarre and frightening experiences into books that grip rather than repel the reader. When they are successful, such reports grant us rare access to the psychic antipodes \u2014 a chaotic realm of hyper-signification and cosmic paranoia far beyond the boundaries of healthy consciousness. Joining the likes of Kay Redfield Jamison\u2019s \u201cAn Unquiet Mind,\u201d Leonora Carrington\u2019s \u201cDown Below\u201d and, more recently, Arnold Thomas Fanning\u2019s harrowing \u201cMind on Fire,\u201d is the German novelist and translator Thomas Melle\u2019s illuminating memoir of the illness that has devastated his life.",
      "\u201cThe World at My Back\u201d",
      "recounts three prolonged manic episodes and their painful aftermaths, the first in 1999, when Melle was in his 20s and newly living in Berlin. The others were in 2006 and 2010 (an epilogue brings us up to 2016, the year the book was first published in Germany). \u201cWhen I had sex with Madonna, I felt good for a moment,\u201d he writes in the opening pages \u2014 a foretaste of the weird delusions and extreme derangement that follow, in which celebrities like Bj\u00f6rk, Trent Reznor and G\u00fcnter Grass are coordinates in the internal cosmology of a psyche utterly spinning out.",
      "The onset of Melle\u2019s bipolar disorder coincides with his emergence as an acclaimed novelist, and at first his megalomania is camouflaged by the typically grandiose ambition of the young writer. Soon however, accelerated by early blogging culture and online forums, his madness is unmistakable \u2014 and alienates his friends and peers. As Philip K. Dick observed in his novel of psychosis \u201cValis,\u201d the mentally disturbed eschew simple interpretations and \u201cshoot for the baroque.\u201d In Melle\u2019s messianic delusions even \u201cHitler had in the end believed that he was me.\u201d Literally everything is about him \u2014 \u201cright down to the Gaza Strip\u201d \u2014 and everyone is either on his side or out to get him.",
      "Such books as \u201cThe World at My Back\u201d",
      "recount experiences of total frenzy from a vantage point of clarity and calm. What makes Melle\u2019s stand out is that he seems aware of how blackly funny the intimate details of psychotic breakdown can be. His narrative skill, in Luise Von Flotow\u2019s translation, had me laughing out loud without my losing sight of the sorrow and loneliness behind the succession of outrageous incidents, including excruciating public appearances at literary prize ceremonies.",
      "Not so amusing are the passages where Melle attempts suicide by overdose and fakes his own death, or his frequent hospitalizations. He\u2019s astute on the agonies of shame endured when the mania ends and the depression sets in (\u201cDepression is not a lack of feeling, which is what I had imagined, it is a constant humiliation\u201d). And he\u2019s sadly on the mark when he admits that bipolar disorder is \u201cnot an illness that elicits empathy.\u201d The tragedy of the afflicted is that they drift helplessly into the realm of the sinister; friends and colleagues want to help, only to eventually back off, fearing that they will become targets of paranoid vitriol or abuse.",
      "There are minor irritations: Melle\u2019s habit of assuming familiarity with his previous works; a hurried diaristic flatness that intermittently washes out his style (\u201cDid my rounds, still filled with shame. Read a lot again\u201d); an occasional, jarring flippancy. By his third onset of mania the recounted delusions begin to feel mechanical.",
      "On the whole, though, Melle succeeds exceptionally well in conveying catastrophic loss while commanding the reader\u2019s attention. Not only is there no aspect of his life that hasn\u2019t been adversely affected by his condition \u2014 from his libido and his hairline to his literary output \u2014 by the book\u2019s end he can\u2019t even be sure that another, potentially worse attack isn\u2019t coming down the tracks. While only the ",
      " of mania is chronic, Melle\u2019s bipolar disorder is a life sentence. It\u2019s sobering to think that even his memoir\u2019s success \u2014 a best seller in Germany, it has been adapted for the stage and translated into many languages \u2014 is not something he will be able to straightforwardly enjoy. This excellent book is faint consolation for the dreadful times that brought it into being.",

      "PARIS \u2014 The contrast could not be more stark.",
      "On a frigid Saturday evening earlier this year inside the Stade Charl\u00e9ty, a World War II-era stadium tucked alongside a highway, the stands are barely a quarter full. Only about 3,000 fans have turned up to watch Paris F.C., a crowd so small that when the home team goes to salute its support after its victory, the players need only to go to one corner of the stadium. The other sections are not even open, given the paltry demand for tickets.",
      "On Sunday, another Paris team takes the field, and fans around the world tune in to \u200cwatch. This Paris team, the billion-dollar project you know from the Champions League, the one with ",
      ", all ",
      " and ",
      ", has traveled to Marseille for another installment of French soccer\u2019s biggest rivalry. There, it \u200ctakes another step toward its latest championship behind goals from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Lionel Messi.",
      "\u200cThat yawning gulf between the teams is something that the owners of Paris F.C. are eager to close. They argue that the Paris region, with its population of more than 12 million, deserves an elite league rivalry, the kind that courses through European cities like London and Lisbon, Madrid and Milan.",
      "The problem, Paris F.C. is finding, is that even with soccer\u2019s deepest pool of talent on its doorstep and backing from its own Gulf royals, closing the gap in a one-team town is extremely hard.",
      "Sitting in a brasserie close to his home in an upscale neighborhood that houses the tomb of Napoleon, Pierre Ferracci, the majority owner of Paris F.C., is ruminating on why Paris \u2014 one of the world\u2019s great cities and ",
      " than just about any other metropolis in the world \u2014 has only one top-division team, Paris St.-Germain.",
      "Ferracci, 70, lists a group of European capitals before moving on to other large cities to underline the outlier that is Paris. He eventually lands on London, less than a three-hour train ride away, which currently has so many teams playing in the Premier League that Ferracci gives up on naming them all.",
      "He explains away the contrast between France and England (and Germany and Spain and Italy) as a type of French exceptionalism. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural,\u201d Ferracci says. \u201cWe are less hung up on football than other countries.\u201d",
      "He knows that devotion to the sport, at least in Paris, does not run deep. \u201cThe supporters here come when there is success, when we climb the rungs of the ladder,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stop coming when the team descends.\u201d",
      "In the stands at the Charl\u00e9ty, the few supporters seem to confirm that view as they offer different motivations for their presence. Zouber Hadj-Larbi, a self-described P.S.G. fan, said he decided to attend his first Paris F.C. game because it was a much cheaper option than a ticket for the team he actually supports.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also a lot less spectacular,\u201d he said, laughing as the home team struggled to muster a shot on goal. Others in the crowd are tourists; a few say they are taking in the game only because P.S.G. was on the road.",
      "Nearby, Laurent Pinet, part of Paris F.C.\u2019s small cohort of regular fans, commiserated with a friend about the team\u2019s struggles to attract a following. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to be a football club in Paris than anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need immediate results to attract the public.\u201d",
      "Ferracci, who has been the majority owner of the club for 13 years, is confident fans will turn out in greater numbers if the team is playing in the top division, drawn by both its success and its name. \u201cThe opportunity we have,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we have a good name: Paris F.C.\u201d",
      "He admits his club is unlikely to ever be a true rival to P.S.G., and definitely not as long as its neighbor is bankrolled by Qatar. But careful and deliberate plans have been laid to build a team that could finally give Parisians a second top-flight option.",
      "That plan is reliant on tapping a resource Paris has in abundance: talented young soccer players.",
      "Ferracci\u2019s ideas for reviving Paris F.C. crystallized after a dinner with the famed French manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger a couple years after he took control of the club in 2008. Wenger used hard data, anecdotes and a list of professional players who had grown up in greater Paris to make his point. Ferracci now often does the same.",
      "By his reckoning, 13 percent of all registered soccer players in France are from Paris or its ring of suburbs, and a staggering 50 percent of the professionals making a living in France\u2019s top two divisions grew up in the capital or its shadow. Those players populate not only France\u2019s national team but several others: Morocco. Senegal. Tunisia. Algeria. At last year\u2019s World Cup, for example, Paris F.C. could track seven of its own alumni among the participants.",
      "Just being close to the best players, though, is not enough, said Jean Marc Nobilo. A well-traveled coach, Nobilo was hired two years ago to lead Paris F.C.\u2019s youth development section, and he knows that every big team in Europe ",
      ".",
      "Ferocious competition for that talent means Paris F.C. is required to unearth it before it has been spotted by others. Bidding wars are typically won by richer teams, thanks in part to French soccer rules that allow clubs to pay fees \u2014 sometimes as much as $100,000 \u2014 to the parents of gifted children.",
      "For economic reasons alone, Nobilo said, \u201cwe must be on the case before the others.\u201d",
      "To ensure that Paris F.C. can do that, Ferracci has enlisted star power and Gulf money of his own. The former arrived in the form of a Paris Saint-Germain legend, the retired Brazilian midfielder Ra\u00ed, who was hired to be a club ambassador and a connection to soccer\u2019s other great talent basin, S\u00e3o Paulo.",
      "The much-needed money arrived as an investment from the rulers of Bahrain, the Gulf emirate that three years ago ",
      "Ceding stakes to foreign partners \u2014 in addition to the Bahrainis, there are Americans, an Indian group and also Armenian equity owners of Paris F.C. \u2014 has been somewhat bittersweet for Ferracci. The cash has helped finance a multimillion-dollar makeover of the club\u2019s training facilities, located on the edge of Paris close to Orly airport, and has helped the club to invest in new talent and the staff to find more of it.",
      "But it has also made Paris F.C. yet another club reliant on foreign capital, a trend that Ferracci laments even as he benefits from it. He says his Gulf royals have been far less munificent than the Emirati owners at Manchester City or the Qataris at P.S.G. \u2014 Paris F.C.\u2019s annual revenues of 23 million euros ($25.4 million) are roughly half of what Messi is earning to play across town \u2014 and Ferracci is fine with that.",
      "\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like are countries like the Emirates and Qatar investing in football because it sets the bar too high,\u201d he said, before launching into an unironic soliloquy about how Gulf-funded clubs have destabilized the soccer industry, forcing rivals to risk financial ruin to try to keep up.",
      "Ferracci is determined to maintain control of his team for as long as he can.",
      "\u201cToday I still want the majority of the capital to be in local hands, that the majority stays French and national,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because if we continue like this, every club in the top two leagues will be in the hands of foreign investors, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",
      "For the moment, he is focusing on what his investors, and his plan, have allowed him to pursue: a dream of creating the best finishing school in French soccer. New facilities, the chance to play close to home and the ability to offer teenagers an earlier shot at first-team soccer all give Paris F.C. a fighting chance of meeting its aim of filling at least a third of its roster with homegrown talent. Five players in Paris F.C.\u2019s current squad came through its youth ranks. But it needs even more.",
      "How it handles those recruits and the others that arrive will determine the success of his project. Paris F.C. is currently bumbling through another year in the middle of the second division standings. That means rubbing shoulders with P.S.G., even as a minor irritant rather than a true rival, will have to wait at least another year.",
      "\u201cFor now, they are aware of our existence,\u201d said Pinet, one of the team\u2019s regular fans. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about rivalry later.\u201d",
      "Tom Nouvian contributed reporting."

      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 A day before Major League Baseball played regular-season games here for the first time, Nick Martinez, a pitcher for the San Diego Padres, had an idea. Accompanied by a few teammates, he visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Friday, which was a day off for both the San Francisco Giants and the Padres.",
      "On the way to the church, Martinez noticed several shops selling pi\u00f1atas. He bought a few, hoping they could be smashed by the player of the game after each of the contests.",
      "\u201cBeing in San Diego, Mexican culture is very much a part of our culture,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd being here in Mexico for this series, the pi\u00f1atas were an opportunity to keep that Mexican culture in our clubhouse.\u201d",
      "So after the Padres defeated the Giants, 16-11, on Saturday, in a slugfest made possible by the conditions of Mexico City, Padres designated hitter Nelson Cruz donned a sombrero in the colors of the Mexican flag as he struggled to break open a Buzz Lightyear pi\u00f1ata. His teammates cheered him on while wearing Mexican lucha libre wrestling masks. And after a 6-4 Padres win on Sunday, first baseman Matt Carpenter sent candy flying onto the clubhouse floor when he busted open a pi\u00f1ata in the shape of a star.",
      "\u201cIt was a real short bat,\u201d Cruz explained later of his pi\u00f1ata troubles. He eventually gave up and ripped it open by hand. \u201cIf it had been a normal bat, it would\u2019ve been done with one swing.\u201d",
      "For two days at Estadio Alfredo Harp Hel\u00fa, the M.L.B. games were a celebration of Mexico and its love of baseball. The league had previously played regular-season games in Monterrey in 1996, 1999, 2018 and 2019. Exhibition contests were played in Mexico City in the past but playing games that mattered in the country\u2019s capital was different.",
      "M.L.B. wanted to do so in Mexico City sooner, but the $166 million stadium, which holds 20,000 fans, wasn\u2019t completed until 2019. The facility is home to the Mexican League\u2019s Diablos Rojos, a team owned by the Mexican billionaire Alfredo Harp Hel\u00fa, also a part owner of the Padres.",
      "Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world, a metropolis more populous (22 million) than New York City (20 million) and 2,000 feet higher in altitude than Denver, which is home to M.L.B.\u2019s Colorado Rockies and is famously a mile above sea level. It is also the largest city in North America without a franchise in the region\u2019s four major men\u2019s professional sports leagues (N.B.A., N.F.L., N.H.L. and M.L.B.).",
      "Soccer may be the biggest sport in Mexico but baseball has a strong foothold, particularly in certain regions of this country of 127 million people. Given how the Toronto Blue Jays are the M.L.B. team for all of Canada, baseball officials and fans have dreamed about the potential of an expansion franchise in Mexico City.",
      "\u201cIt would be a great experience,\u201d said Juan Soto, a star outfielder for the Padres who is from the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt makes me think of soccer, where those players live traveling from city to city.\u201d",
      "Even though M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred has praised the business prospects of Mexico City and the Mexican market as a whole ",
      ", he recently said that he had \u201cnever been close to the idea of Mexico as an expansion opportunity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe challenges are facility based,\u201d he said last week. \u201cEven the stadium that we\u2019re playing in this weekend is probably not big enough for a permanent home for a major league club. And then, of course, our season is so long. I have a union issue there that would have to be bargained to get players to live for that long of a period of time in Mexico.\u201d",
      "The current goal for Mexico, Manfred said, was to improve M.L.B.\u2019s relationships with existing professional baseball leagues there and to have the country become a North American equivalent of Japan, with \u201cvibrant, domestic professional play\u201d and \u201cstar players given the opportunity to come and play Major League Baseball.\u201d He said having more Mexican players in M.L.B. would help baseball appeal to the large Mexican American audience in the United States and create more broadcast interest in Mexico.",
      "Based on the weekend of games in Mexico City, there was indeed an appetite for the sport. The scenes in the stands and on the field reflected a spirited baseball culture. The tickets for the games sold out quickly in November. About 20,000 fans attended each game but it sounded like more.",
      "Mexican food \u2014 including micheladas, tacos, aguachile and churros \u2014 were sold in abundance. A mariachi band played throughout the games, performing a rendition of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\u201d during the seventh-inning stretch. Hundreds of fans lingered outside the stadium after the final game to send off both teams with cheers and waves.",
      "\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d said Manny Machado, a third baseman for the Padres whose family is from the Dominican Republic. \u201cWhat most impressed me was the fans and how passionate they were, especially for us Latinos who play with a lot of passion and energy.\u201d",
      "After each of the seven home runs they hit over the weekend, the Padres, the M.L.B. team closest to the Mexican border, put a sombrero on the head of the player who smashed the ball over the fence. Fernando Tatis Jr. bought it on Friday during a trip to the famous canals of Xochimilco in Mexico City. When Padres relievers walked out to the bullpen, they did so in lucha libre masks gifted to the team by the Mexican American professional wrestler Rey Mysterio.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Tatis said of playing in Mexico City. \u201cFor us Latin Americans, it\u2019s something beautiful to play in front of our people and taking the game to the kids who don\u2019t normally see us play in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Roughly three-quarters of the tickets sold online were purchased in Mexico, according to M.L.B., while the remaining tickets were purchased in the United States, primarily in California. But walking the stands, it felt like more Padres fans were visiting from the United States and several said they bought their tickets online through secondary-market resellers in Mexico.",
      "In the left-field bleachers, Felipe P\u00e9rez, 44, said he met many fans from the United States but also several Mexicans who had traveled from throughout the country. He was one of them; he said he took a seven-hour bus ride on Saturday from Veracruz, a city on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and arrived in Mexico City just in time for the 4 p.m. game. He returned home at 11 a.m. the next day.",
      "All that effort was worth it, P\u00e9rez said, because he loves baseball. He added in Spanish, \u201cI\u2019m happy. To see a big league game here, it\u2019s the best.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez had been waiting for these games. He and his family bought tickets for the April 2020 series in Mexico City between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Padres that was erased by the pandemic. He marveled at the atmosphere around him on Saturday as he nursed a beer.",
      "\u201cMexicans have a way of enjoying shows and life,\u201d P\u00e9rez said as fans stomped their feet for Tatis at the plate. \u201cPeople get behind a team. Look at how people are cheering.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Mexican baseball has improved on the international stage. On opening day M.L.B. rosters this season, there were 15 players born in Mexico, the highest total since 2005. In March, the Mexican national team finished third in the World Baseball Classic, its best showing in the tournament. And the most powerful fan in Mexico is its president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who hosted a breakfast on Sunday at El Palacio Nacional for, among others, Trevor Hoffman, a Hall of Famer who starred for the Padres; Sergio Romo, a reliever who won three World Series titles with the Giants; and Harp Hel\u00fa.",
      "Romo, who is Mexican American, said he didn\u2019t think the hurdles for Mexico City as a future M.L.B. home were as big as some may think. He said plenty of English was spoken in the international hub and that there was lots of tourism and history here.",
      "\u201cI do feel that Mexico does have a little bit of a bad rap in terms of like safety and whatnot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here in Mexico, you\u2019re safe. There\u2019s a lot of really cool things going on and obviously every city has their neighborhoods you don\u2019t want to go to. But this place has so many other spots that are so welcoming and open.\u201d",
      "Regular-season games, at the very least, are expected to return to Mexico City. As part of its overseas push in recent years, M.L.B. played ",
      ", expanding a world tour that already included Japan, Puerto Rico and Australia. In the latest labor agreement, M.L.B. and the players\u2019 union agreed to more regular-season games in London, some in Paris in 2025 and yearly trips to Mexico City from 2023 to 2026.",
      "The altitude and the turf in Mexico City will present some ongoing challenges \u2014 or advantages \u2014 to players. On Saturday, the ball zoomed through the thinner air and the teams combined for 11 home runs and 30 hits. Defenders said the ball skipped off the ground and rocketed past them.",
      "Pitchers said their pitches didn\u2019t move like usual, clarifying that it was even more of an issue than it is at Coors Field in Denver. After running the bases on Saturday, Cruz said he felt more out of breath. Yu Darvish, the Padres pitcher, said umpires told him he could call for a trainer during his start on Sunday if he was feeling too winded. Alex Cobb, a pitcher for the Giants, said his team\u2019s training staff provided more fluids and electrolytes to avoid dehydration.",
      "But for a team expected to contend for the playoffs, and which had been previously struggling at the plate, a memorable trip to Mexico City might have been exactly what the Padres needed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to stay here another week,\u201d said Machado, who homered twice."

      "The mystery man was tall and lean and he was smiling, perpetually smiling. His life had dramatically changed when he left Cuba in a fishing boat, and it was about to change again. Every day featured more changes, more smiles and more glimpses of the pitcher known as El Duque.",
      "That was the scene on a sunny spring training day when Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez first pitched in front of the Yankees. After fleeing Cuba on the day after Christmas in 1997, he took a dangerous and circuitous route to signing a four-year, $6.6 million contract with the Yankees. Now Hern\u00e1ndez was finally on a mound in Tampa in late March of 1998, surrounded by curious Yankees coaches and executives who were eager to see him pitch.",
      "He tossed a baseball softly and confidently, the ball snapping off his fingertips and popping into the catcher\u2019s mitt. There was an ease and a swagger about Hern\u00e1ndez, a recognition that all eyes were on him and a realization that he adored the attention. After more than a year of not playing baseball, he was finally pitching again.",
      "On that day in Tampa, the real El Duque antics started when he pitched from a windup and unveiled a funky motion that was different from any that the attendees had ever seen. His eyes looked menacing as he held his glove in front of his face, but it was his limber and acrobatic leg kick that made him so distinctive. He lifted his left leg and it climbed higher and higher, his knee almost brushing his chin, and then he peered to the side before reconnecting with the target and powering forward to fire a pitch. It was athletic. It was balletic. It was gorgeous.",
      "\u201cHe showed up for this bullpen session in Tampa and he just had this presence about him like he was Michael Jordan,\u201d said General Manager Brian Cashman. \u201cThere was something projecting from him, a presence that you could feel. It was greatness. He wasn\u2019t cocky, but there was something about him.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez did not have a single major league inning on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but Cashman saw a similar ultracompetitive nature between the pitcher and Jordan.",
      "\u201cI feel like when you\u2019re around successful people, they emit an aura about them,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cAnd, before El Duque knew what he could do around here, he was emitting that aura. He had a presence.\u201d",
      "Cashman wasn\u2019t alone in instantly noticing Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s presence, his confidence and his talents. He was so excited to pitch again, so excited to be a Yankee and, honestly, was probably excited to show off. He had been the king of the mound in Cuba, a baseball-obsessed country where he had a gaudy 129-47 record for Havana\u2019s Industriales, who are Cuba\u2019s version of the Yankees.",
      "As I watched El Duque, on and off the field, I eventually realized there was no one like him. He was daring and proud and focused and captivating. While working on ",
      " \u201cThe 1998 Yankees: The Inside Story of the Greatest Baseball Team Ever,\u201d there were constant reminders that Hern\u00e1ndez was the most fascinating player on that historic team. I devoted a chapter to him and called it \u201cInternational Man of Mystery\u201d because he made an already great team even more imposing, because he was a very savvy and gutsy pitcher and because he was a joy to observe.",
      "\u201cCouldn\u2019t stop watching him,\u201d said David Cone, another Yankees pitcher known for his creativity. \u201cWanted to see what he did next.\u201d",
      "How could El Duque pitch so effectively with a leg kick that would make a Rockette proud? How many arm angles did he use? How many pitches did he throw? The questions hovered over Hern\u00e1ndez, and he answered them all emphatically while going 12-4 with a 3.13 earned run average. Then he won the Yankees\u2019 most important game of the season in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series.",
      "He was immune to pressure.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has written the right movie script for this guy,\u201d said catcher Jorge Posada. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to really tell his story and what he had to go through to get here and pitch for the Yankees. That\u2019s just a movie waiting to happen. It was unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Covering Hern\u00e1ndez in 1998 was highly entertaining, a delightful show every time he stared at a batter. He was just different. Even the way he prepared for games was different. Before he picked up a baseball, he would do wind sprints, leg kicks and calisthenics in the outfield, making other pitchers look like weekend warriors.",
      "Most pitchers don\u2019t speak to reporters before starts, but Hern\u00e1ndez was chatty. Before his fifth start, he casually told reporters that Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader and a man he reviled, would very likely watch him pitch against the Mets, and he added, \u201cHe knows everything.\u201d After talking and talking, Hern\u00e1ndez proceeded to throw 141 pitches across eight innings. And he wanted to keep pitching.",
      "\u201cIn Cuba, you don\u2019t have a relief pitcher every time out,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cIn Cuba, it\u2019s win or die.\u201d",
      "The teammate with the best perspective on Hern\u00e1ndez was Posada, who was as headstrong as the pitcher he caught. Of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s 23 starts in the regular season and postseason in 1998, Posada caught 21 of them. All these years later, he searched for the optimal way to describe El Duque.",
      "\u201cHe was just perfection,\u201d Posada said. \u201cHe was so \u2014 well, perfection is a word, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for. He wasn\u2019t nervous. He went through hell and now he\u2019s living his childhood dream. He was just saying: \u2018I\u2019m here. This is the best time of my life and I\u2019m not going to take anything for granted.\u2019 Yeah, I guess perfection is the word I wanted to use.\u201d",
      "In the emotional and feisty Posada, the Yankees had the ideal catcher to handle Hern\u00e1ndez. Posada respected Hern\u00e1ndez and felt an immediate kinship with him because Posada\u2019s father had also defected from Cuba in 1968.",
      "\u201cI told him all about my dad and, of course, it brought us closer,\u201d Posada said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez called Posada \u201ca brother for me then and a brother for me today,\u201d and they were part of a very tight-knit Yankees\u2019 team. After a tumultuous 1-4 start in which Manager Joe Torre and Cashman wondered about their job security, the Yankees cruised through an idyllic season. Pressure? What pressure? The Yankees kept winning, so there was little stress. Until Game 4 of the A.L.C.S. Until they trailed the Indians two games to one in a best-of-seven series.",
      "\u201cIt was really the first time all year that we were worried,\u201d said outfielder Paul O\u2019Neill.",
      "Enter El Duque, an unflappable pitcher who treated the pressure-packed game the same as any other start. On the morning of Game 4, Torre was eating breakfast in the hotel restaurant when he noticed a familiar figure cleaning plates and silverware from tables to help the overtaxed staff. That helper was Hern\u00e1ndez, who was as carefree as a pitcher could be.",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t afraid of a thing,\u201d said Derek Jeter. \u201cAnd, if you think about it, he was the perfect guy for that game.\u201d",
      "Since Hern\u00e1ndez had not pitched in 15 days, it was important for him to navigate through the first inning and find the feel for his pitches. But a single and a walk put two runners on base for Jim Thome, who had blasted two homers in Game 3. And Thome almost went deep again as he drove Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s changeup to right field, but O\u2019Neill caught it in front of the fence for the third out. The Yankees exhaled. Then the game became the El Duque Show as he pitched seven scoreless innings in a 4-0 win.",
      "It is not hyperbole to say that Hern\u00e1ndez rescued the Yankees. Had the Yankees faltered, they would have been one loss away from elimination, and the pressure would have been insufferable. The incessant question would have been: Could the team that won 114 regular season games flop? With all that the Yankees had accomplished, that would have been a crisis they had not faced all season. Instead, El Duque guided the Yankees.",
      "\u201cI had pressure,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cBut I had no fear.\u201d",
      "El Duque gave the Yankees much more than one win that tied the series. In the relieved clubhouse, it was evident that Hern\u00e1ndez had also given the Yankees their swagger back. For 48 tense hours, the Yankees were an uncomfortable bunch who wondered if their remarkable ride was about to end. It didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t because of El Duque, the most compelling character in my book and the most fascinating player on the greatest team ever.",

      "Mike Shannon, who played in three World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals and then became a favorite of the team\u2019s fans as one of its radio broadcasters for 50 seasons, died on Saturday. He was 83.",
      "The Cardinals announced the death but did not give a cause or say where he died. Shannon had been hospitalized in 2020 with Covid-19 and later suffered from symptoms of long Covid.",
      "Shannon was one of the few announcers in baseball history to spend 50 years or more with one team. His longevity was among the things that endeared him to listeners, along with his exuberance and his passion for seeing the Cardinals win.",
      "In 2003, when the Cardinal slugger Albert Pujols hit a home run after being brushed back by the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Kerry Wood, ",
      " Take a ride on that knockdown pitch, big boy! Kerry Wood knocked him down and now Albert looks at him as he goes around first. He gives him the glare, saying, \u2018Take a whiff of that, big boy!\u2019\u201d",
      " the former NBC sportscaster whose early professional work was in St. Louis, said that Shannon\u2019s roots there were a key to his success. \u201cHe was one of those guys,\u201d he said by phone, \u201clike Herb Score in Cleveland, Joe Nuxhall in Cincinnati and Jerry Remy in Boston, where it works because he\u2019s local, he\u2019s one of our guys \u2014 and, in his case, grew up in St Louis and was a three-sport star in high school.\u201d",
      "Shannon was known for his signature home run call, \u201cGet up, baby, get up!\u201d and for odd and idiosyncratic lines: He referred to a pop-up as \u201ca home run in a telephone booth\u201d and to a Cardinal victory as a \u201cmonstramental win,\u201d and he once declared that a young fan who had been hit by a foul ball \u201cwill leave the stadium with a souvenir today \u2014 not a ball but a nice-looking bruise.\u201d",
      "Joe Buck, who, like his father, ",
      ", was one of Shannon\u2019s radio partners, said by phone: \u201cHis Shannonisms made for great listening, and some of it was so illogical. But you had to know he was one of the most common-sense people I\u2019ve ever met. He had a keen eye for the game and would have been a great manager.\u201d",
      "Thomas Michael Shannon was born on July 15, 1939, in St. Louis to Thomas and Elizabeth (Richason) Shannon. His father was a police officer and later became a city prosecutor.",
      "Mike was an outstanding athlete at Christian Brothers College High School, where he was a football all-American, and in 1957 he was named the Missouri prep player of the year in both basketball and football. He attended the University of Missouri for a year as a quarterback on a football scholarship. But he was also a baseball prospect, and in 1958 he signed with the Cardinals for what he said in his autobiography was almost $100,000, although it was reported at the time as $40,000.",
      "After four years in the minor leagues, he played sparingly with the Cardinals in 1962 and 1963, often as the late-innings defensive replacement for the great hitter Stan Musial, who was then in the final year of his Hall of Fame career.",
      "Shannon did not follow Musial into the Hall of Fame (although he played with several future Hall of Famers, including Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Orlando Cepeda and Steve Carlton). But he was a solid player whose two-run home run off the Yankees\u2019 Whitey Ford in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series tied the score at 4-4. The Cardinals won the game, 9-5, and went on to take the series in seven games.",
      "In 1967, Shannon moved from right field to third base after the Cardinals acquired Roger Maris from the Yankees. The two became close friends.",
      "St. Louis won the World Series again that year, beating the Boston Red Sox in seven games. The next year, the Detroit Tigers defeated the Cardinals, also in seven games. Shannon hit a home run in each of those series.",
      "Shannon played until 1970, when he developed membranous nephropathy, an autoimmune disorder of the kidneys, which ended his career. ",
      " with 68 home runs and 367 runs batted in, and was elected to the Cardinals\u2019 Hall of Fame in 2014. Two of his teammates died recently: the shortstop ",
      " last month and the catcher Tim McCarver, who also had a distinguished career as a broadcaster, in February.",
      "Shannon joined the Cardinals\u2019 promotions department in 1971 and became a team announcer the next season. In addition to calling Cardinal games, he was part of NBC\u2019s backup crew for its \u201cGame of the Week\u201d in the 1980s. He retired after the 2021 season.",
      "His survivors include his wife, Lori (Bergman) Shannon; his daughters, Patricia, Peg and Erin; his sons, Michael Jr., Tim and Dan; 18 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His first wife, Judith Ann (Bufe) Shannon, died in 2007.",
      "The ball that Shannon slugged in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series traveled more than 450 feet and broke the \u201cu\u201d in the Budweiser sign in left field at Busch Stadium, causing $5,000 in damage. At first, he thought he would have to pay for it.",
      "In his autobiography, \u201cGet Up, Baby!: My Seven Decades with the St. Louis Cardinals\u201d (2022, with Rick Hummel), he recalled: \u201cGussie Busch, our owner, said in that gravelly voice of his, \u2018That\u2019s all right, buddy. You can break the whole sign down.\u2019 And Gussie paid for it.\u201d"

      "Jack Hughes thought he had it pretty good as a professional hockey player. The No. 1 draft pick in 2019, Hughes was living his best life over the ensuing four seasons, skating for the Devils and emerging as a superstar in the N.H.L.",
      "Then he got to the postseason.",
      "\u201cI used to think the regular season in the N.H.L. was a blast,\u201d he said, beaming. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even come close to the playoffs.\u201d",
      "Hughes and his Devils teammates were soaring Monday night in Newark, N.J., after their 4-0 win over the Rangers in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series. They bumped off their ",
      " and more experienced neighbors and sent a message that seems to have been delivered a year or two ahead of schedule.",
      "The Devils, who had not won a playoff series since 2012, won only 27 games last season as they continued to rebuild under Tom Fitzgerald, their general manager since 2020. They had added top-end draft picks, like Hughes and Nico Hischier, the first overall pick in 2017, made promising trades and brought in key free agents.",
      "The team they built is sizzling fast and skillful, and signs ",
      ". Now they hope it will be followed by a steady climb across the next several seasons.",
      "Considering the ages of most of these speedy young players, the blossoming talent and cohesion, and the evidence seen on the ice in the series, it is reasonable to assume the league \u2014 and Rangers fans \u2014 will have to contend with these Devils well beyond 2023.",
      "\u201cThis is the time of the year we want to be playing in for the next 10 years,\u201d said Hughes, who also noted that Devils fans now own regional bragging rights, at least until next spring.",
      "Monday\u2019s Game 7 ended a wild first round of the N.H.L. playoffs, in which ",
      ". Fourteen games went to overtime, with the road team winning 11 of those. The ",
      ", the Boston Bruins, ",
      ", the second and final wild card in the East. The defending champion Colorado Avalanche fell to the Seattle Kraken, a second-year expansion team that is playing in its first postseason.",
      "The Toronto Maple Leafs ",
      " for the first time since 2004, beating the Lightning in Game 6 in Tampa, Fla., and became one of six teams to clinch their series on the road.",
      "Of the eight remaining teams, the Carolina Hurricanes are ",
      " champion, all the way back in 2006. They beat the Islanders on Long Island in overtime of Game 6 and will now host the Devils for Game 1 on Wednesday.",
      "The Devils are likely to stick with goalie Akira Schmid, their rookie sensation, who helped reverse the series against the Rangers. After New Jersey lost the first two games at home, Coach Lindy Ruff sat Vitek Vanecek for Game 3 and gave Schmid the net. The Devils won four of the next five games.",
      "Schmid posted two shutouts and a 1.38 goals against average in the series and became the fifth rookie to earn a shutout in a Game 7, the first since Montreal\u2019s Carey Price in 2008.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing was that Schmido, obviously, came in and played unreal,\u201d Hughes said of the team\u2019s turnaround. \u201cHe was a brick wall for us.\u201d",
      "Schmid may be another part of the Devils\u2019 promising future. He will turn 23 on May 12, and started only 14 regular-season games, coming off the bench in four others for the Devils, who had signed Vanecek to a three-year contract last summer. Vanecek was excellent during the regular season, but desperation forced a move.",
      "Schmid is from Bern, Switzerland, is 6-foot-5, 205 pounds and teammates nicknamed him Schmido the Torpedo. He played 23 games in the minors for the American Hockey League\u2019s Utica Comets this season, and his goals against average was higher there (2.62) than it was in his regular-season games with New Jersey (2.13). Maybe that is not surprising. That statistic also reflects the play of the team in general, and Schmid explained that playing in the N.H.L. can be less chaotic for a goalie. The structure in front of goal is usually better, and defenders are more adept at clearing away rebounds and preventing tip-ins.",
      "\u201cIt almost makes it easier to read the play sometimes,\u201d Schmid said.",
      "While the Devils are noticeably speedy, they also displayed desire and toughness, especially in Game 7. Ondrej Palat\u2019s relentless forechecking and unremitting desire led directly to the first goal Monday. Palat, who won two Stanley Cups with the Tampa Bay Lightning, was signed in July to add playoff experience and he demonstrated to his team the kind of work required to win in the playoffs.",
      "\u201cThis team has no quit,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cThey give me everything they have.\u201d",
      "Erik Haula is another veteran acquired last off-season, through a trade with Boston, to augment the team\u2019s playoff savvy. He played 41 games for the Hurricanes in 2019-20 and played against them in the playoffs last year as a member of the Bruins, who lost in seven games.",
      "On Monday, Haula scored his team\u2019s third goal in another example of the Devils\u2019 blend of hard work with finesse and determination with skill. Palat won a puck battle on the boards, kicked the puck up to Hughes, who feathered a perfect pass for Haula to slap home.",
      "The Devils will need more of that against the tough Hurricanes, who have the home-ice advantage in the series through winning the Metropolitan Division by one point over the Devils. But when they get home to Newark for Games 3 and 4, Haula predicted the atmosphere will be even better than it was in the first round.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only going to get louder when we get those Rangers fans out of here,\u201d he said."

      "All told, there were around a dozen offers for officials at Argentina\u2019s national soccer federation to contemplate. They came, largely, from the game\u2019s commercially lucrative emerging markets: the United States, China, Australia, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates. The only outlier, really, was an unlikely bid from Bangladesh.",
      "Each suitor wanted the same thing \u2014 the chance to host Lionel Messi and Argentina in one of two designated windows for friendly matches this summer \u2014 but all had their own motivation. Some were inspired by the sporting prestige of gracing the same field as the World Cup champions. For others, the potential benefits strayed into the political.",
      "They were all, though, prepared to pay for the privilege. Each offer promised the A.F.A., Argentina\u2019s soccer federation, not just a slice of ticket sales, television rights and commercial revenue from the games, but an eye-watering appearance fee, too.",
      "Five months since it won the World Cup in Qatar, Argentina has become the most in-demand, and possibly the most expensive, opponent in international soccer. The going rate for a single game with the world champion has climbed so high that $5 million is now just the starting point, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions.",
      "The identity of the winning bids for the two matches in June is not yet official. The A.F.A. is continuing to assess its options, and will only make a firm decision once Lionel Scaloni, the national team\u2019s coach, indicates he is comfortable with their plans.",
      "Sources inside a number of the national associations involved, though, have suggested that the most likely schedule is for Argentina to play its first game in China \u2014 possibly against Australia, pending Scaloni\u2019s approval \u2014 and then travel to Indonesia for a game against a host team currently ranked 149th in the world.",
      "Those matchups illustrate the extent to which the benefits of a meeting with the reigning world champion stretch far beyond the sporting. Such is Argentina\u2019s cachet, in light of its victory in Qatar, that Australia\u2019s soccer authorities have been encouraged to agree to host a game in China in the hope that it might strengthen political and economic ties between the countries, according to an official involved in the talks. The Indonesia game could be seen as a similarly pragmatic reward: Last month, Argentina stepped in as host of this year\u2019s Under-20 World Championship after Indonesia was ",
      " over protests against Israel\u2019s involvement.",
      "That schedule would, however, mean passing on an encounter to play in the United States, though only for the time being. In recent years, the A.F.A. has embarked on a plan to increase both its commercial revenue and its reach \u2014 traditionally overshadowed by its archrival, Brazil \u2014 as part of a strategic attempt to capitalize on its global appeal.",
      "Recent success has played into that. After lifting the Copa Am\u00e9rica trophy in 2021, its first major international honor since 1995 and Messi\u2019s maiden championship with his country, Argentina could claim more sponsors and partners than any other national team on the planet.",
      "That expanded again after Qatar. The A.F.A. has signed deals with four more partners, largely in India and Bangladesh, in the months since the World Cup. There has been a downstream effect for the country\u2019s domestic league, too: It has more sponsors for this season than it has had at any point in its history.",
      "It is the United States, though, that is Argentina\u2019s \u201cpriority for the next four years,\u201d said Leandro Petersen, the A.F.A.\u2019s\u00a0chief commercial and marketing officer. To deepen that connection, the federation plans to ",
      " in North Bay Village, Fla., a tiny outcrop of land between Miami and Miami Beach, to act as a gathering spot for its national teams during international breaks.",
      "The complex may be just the first of a number of facilities in the United States: The A.F.A. is also considering establishing a physical presence in several other cities as part of what Petersen called a \u201clanding strategy.\u201d",
      "Argentina\u2019s national team is scheduled to play on American soil in both 2024 and 2026 \u2014 first to defend its Copa Am\u00e9rica crown, and later its World Cup championship \u2014 but the A.F.A. would like to make the team\u2019s visits an annual event. It is likely to arrange at least one game in North America in 2025\u00a0as part of its preparations for the World Cup, and may even seek to face Mexico \u2014 which now plays the bulk of its friendlies in America \u2014 and the United States that year.",
      "Neither nation would, in all likelihood, turn down that chance. After all, Argentina is now the biggest show in town: not only the world champion but, thanks to its ",
      ", the most compelling team on the planet. Sharing the field with Messi and Co. these days, it would seem, is almost priceless.",

He was 83.",
      "The cause was complications of a stroke, his son Todd said.",
      "Boston dominated the long jump through much of the 1960s by breaking or tying world records six more times over that span. A tall and sinewy Mississippian, he won a gold medal in the Rome Olympics in 1960, a silver medal in Tokyo in 1964 and a bronze in Mexico City in 1968.",
      "Boston won the N.C.A.A. long jump title in 1960, when he was an emerging athlete at Tennessee State University (then known as the Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State University). In August, he burst onto the national scene at a conditioning meet in Los Angeles that served as a final tuneup before the Rome Olympics.",

      "\u201cJesse said it was all right to break it \u2014 he\u2019s tired of it,\u201d Boston told reporters that day. He had not actually spoken to Owens and eventually apologized to him when they met at the Rome Olympics. Owens was gracious.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to see the record broken, and I\u2019m just thankful that it stood up this long,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",

    "name": "FIFA Threatens Women\u2019s World Cup TV Blackout in Europe",

      "The president of soccer\u2019s global governing body on Tuesday harshly criticized European broadcasters for not meeting FIFA\u2019s demands for significantly higher television rights fees for this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. If the offers did not improve, he threatened, the tournament\u2019s matches would not be televised in many of Europe\u2019s biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIt is our moral and legal obligation not to undersell the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup,\u201d the president, Gianni Infantino, said in ",
      " in Geneva. \u201cTherefore, should the offers continue not to be fair, we will be forced not to broadcast the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup into the \u2018Big 5\u2019 European countries,\u201d he added. That group includes England, Germany, France, Spain and Italy \u2014 all of whom will send teams to the tournament.",
      "Reeling off unverifiable figures, Infantino labeled the offers for the World Cup rights \u201ca slap in the face\u201d not only to the World Cup\u2019s players but to women generally.",
      "The comments escalated a fight Infantino opened last year, when he and FIFA rejected initial offers for rights to the women\u2019s championship from several countries as far too low. At the time, he framed the battle as one over fairness, and he has since positioned himself as a champion of women\u2019s soccer by increasing prize money for this year\u2019s tournament and pledging to equalize it with the men\u2019s World Cup by 2027.",
      "But he will need hundreds of millions of dollars from broadcasters and sponsors to fulfill those promises, and his threat that the games might not be broadcast in Europe \u2014 a major driver of the growth of the women\u2019s game \u2014 comes with serious risks.",
      "With little over two months to go until the start of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand and little sign of an accord, the dispute risks overshadowing the biggest Women\u2019s World Cup yet. FIFA has expanded the event to 32 teams for the first time as a sign of its commitment to grow the women\u2019s game, and it has increased the prize money for players and the support money for participating teams to $150 million, a fivefold increase from the last tournament, which was held in France in 2019.",
      "Infantino had hoped that much of that commitment would be financed by higher rights fees from international broadcasters. But in a rebuke to media companies both at the World Cup draw in Auckland last year and at FIFA\u2019s annual meeting in March in Rwanda, he said that was not the case. Each time, he lashed out at the television companies for not paying more for a product that, he said, viewership figures had proved was increasingly popular.",
      "With little movement since then, he took an even tougher line in his latest comments.",
      "\u201cI call, therefore, on all players, fans, football officials, presidents, prime ministers, politicians and journalists all over the world to join us and support this call for a fair remuneration of women\u2019s football,\u201d he said, repeating his remarks ",
      ". \u201cWomen deserve it. As simple as that.\u201d",
      "While women\u2019s soccer in the United States \u2014 where a TV deal is in place \u2014 and in Europe has enjoyed greater investment and ",
      " in recent years, figures for even its biggest games are often significantly lower than for comparable men\u2019s soccer games, and less attractive matches sometimes struggle to attract even in-stadium audiences. Broadcasters also appear to be taking a cautious stance on assigning a value to Women\u2019s World Cup rights that have never previously been on the market. This year is the first time FIFA has decoupled the women\u2019s tournament from the men\u2019s; previously, the women\u2019s rights were bundled as an extra in the bidding for the men\u2019s World Cup rights.",
      "Acknowledging that playing the tournament in Australia and New Zealand might be a factor for broadcasters in Europe, Infantino nonetheless said the sums currently being offered for the tournament were a fraction of what FIFA considers its true value. He noted that while viewing figures for the women\u2019s tournament are 50 percent to 60 percent of those for the men\u2019s World Cup, the amounts offered for the women\u2019s games have been much lower than that: In Europe alone, he said, they were \u201c20 to 100 times lower than for the men\u2019s FIFA World Cup.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhereas broadcasters pay $100-200 million for the men\u2019s FIFA World Cup,\u201d Infantino said, \u201cthey offer only $1-10 million for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup. This is a slap in the face of all the great FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup players and indeed of all women worldwide.\u201d",
      "There has been a substantial interest in women\u2019s soccer in Britain, Europe\u2019s biggest market, which peaked when England beat Germany to win the European championship on home soil last year. That final was played in front of a packed Wembley Stadium and watched by more than 17 million on television, the highest audience for a televised women\u2019s game in Britain. The figure for the final represented 35 percent of the total global audience for the game, according to data from European soccer\u2019s governing body.",
      "The same data, though, highlights how certain women\u2019s games in certain markets draw large audiences but highlights concerns among broadcasters over viewing figures for games not featuring premium teams in a tournament that will feature more games than ever. According to news media reports, the BBC and ITV \u2014 the two main British broadcasters \u2014 have offered about 9 million pounds ($11.2 million) for the World Cup rights, the highest among European broadcasters. The offer from Italy is about $1 million.",
      "The inability of FIFA and broadcasters to reach rights agreements in the next two months does not necessarily mean the games will be unavailable to fans in Europe. FIFA officials have previously spoken about possible alternatives, including airing the games on its own streaming platform or on FIFA\u2019s YouTube channel. Such a move would carry its own risks, however, both by reducing viewing figures and revenue for an event \u2014 and a sport \u2014 that FIFA has a stated commitment to grow."

      "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Anthony Davis sat next to ",
      ", watching as James heaped praise upon him.",
      "\u201cThe Lakers franchise over the years, over the course of their existence, has always had dominant big men, dominant guys that have been a force at the rim,\u201d James said Tuesday night, after a dominant performance by Davis in the Lakers\u2019 Game 1 win in their Western Conference semifinal series against the Golden State Warriors. \u201cThat\u2019s why their jerseys are in the rafters. A.D. will be up there when he\u2019s done playing.\u201d",
      "James went on for another minute in the same vein. Once he finished, Davis patted him on the back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take my watch next week,\u201d James said, smiling at his joke about a quid pro quo. \u201cOr a car.\u201d",
      "Although this series has stirred nostalgia for the years when James and Warriors guard ",
      " used to face off every June for the N.B.A. championship, it could hinge on Davis, who has the potential to be the best player in it. He hasn\u2019t always been that, having been prone to injuries and inconsistent play. But on Tuesday night, Davis showed just what his dominance can mean to the Lakers, as he pushed them to a 117-112 win on the road over the defending champion Warriors, wresting away home-court advantage.",
      "Curry finished with 27 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists while two other Golden State guards, ",
      " and ",
      ", also eclipsed 20 points.",
      "Davis finished the game with 30 points, 23 rebounds and 4 blocks. With at least 30 points and 20 rebounds, Davis joined elite company in Lakers playoff history: ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      ". The most drastic statistical difference between the teams was a direct result of Davis\u2019s play: The Lakers outscored the Warriors inside the paint by 54-28.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everything for us,\u201d Lakers guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der said. \u201cDefensively, offensively, big part for this organization. I mean, wasn\u2019t an All-Star, wasn\u2019t the defensive player of the year. He\u2019s taking it serious, doing everything for us, and he\u2019s the anchor.\u201d",
      "That James and Curry were the narrative center of this series made sense. They are two of the best to have ever played in the N.B.A., and each has won four championships. They played against each other in the finals every year from 2015 to 2018, and each has won a championship since then as well \u2014 James in 2020 and Curry last season.",
      "This is the first time since 2018 that the two have faced each other in the playoffs, and there were plenty of moments Tuesday night when they commanded the stage.",
      "Before the game, the two shared a laugh at the scorer\u2019s table. Midway through the second quarter, while Davis was shooting free throws, James wandered down the sideline with Curry, who was heading to the Golden State bench. James stayed by Curry\u2019s side until he sat down, and even then continued talking to him.",
      "\u201cHe was just joking around about having to guard me all the way till I got to the bench,\u201d Curry said.",
      "But at halftime, James was with Davis. The two of them walked off the court together, shoulder to shoulder, stride for stride.",
      "The scene was reminiscent of their first year together, the 2019-20 championship season, when Davis and James hardly went anywhere without each other and waited for each other to finish their on-court interviews after every game.",
      "The Lakers gave up a lot to acquire Davis the summer before that season, including players who would become critical pieces for other franchises. But Davis seemed to reward the Lakers right away. He was named to All-N.B.A. and All-Defensive first teams. He was a candidate for the Defensive Player of the Year Award. He fit perfectly on James\u2019s team.",
      "Part of what made that partnership work so seamlessly was the way their personalities meshed. Davis never needed to be the center of attention. James didn\u2019t mind it, even thrived in it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not jealous of each other,\u201d James said during the 2020 N.B.A. finals.",
      "That dynamic came into play on Tuesday night when James and Curry were the center of attention.",
      "Davis might not seek attention, but on the court he requires it, especially when he plays the way he did in Game 1.",
      "\u201cWe know that\u2019s what he\u2019s capable of,\u201d Lakers Coach Darvin Ham said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. We needed every bit of all those points and rebounds and blocked shots, assists as well.\u201d",
      "Though Davis excelled at defending inside the paint, he made his presence felt all over the court. Late in the game, he thwarted the Warriors shortly after Curry tied the game with a heart-stopping 3-pointer with 1 minute 38 seconds remaining that capped a 14-0 run.",
      "Lakers guard D\u2019Angelo Russell scored, getting the lead back for the Lakers. Moments later, Curry tried again, this time driving toward the basket, only to have his shot blocked by Davis. With 39.3 seconds left and the Lakers up by 3, Davis grabbed a rebound off a miss by Poole.",
      "Davis was aggressive offensively as well and seemed tireless despite playing 43 minutes 50 seconds, more than any other player. He played the entire second half.",
      "Ham credited the Lakers\u2019 load management during the regular season for Davis\u2019s ability to play big minutes in the playoffs.",
      "Davis\u2019s critics have questioned his durability and his consistency, and not without reason. He has missed games because of injury in every year of his career and played in only 56 games this season.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what no one thinks. Only the guys in the locker room, coaching staff, only opinions that I care about. Other than that, I just go out and play basketball, do what I can do to help the team win.\u201d",
      "Davis and James were two of the last remaining players on the court Tuesday night, Davis doing a postgame interview with TNT and James speaking with the Lakers\u2019 regional broadcast channel. Davis briefly interrupted James\u2019s interview to do a personalized handshake before leaving the court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different game,\u201d Davis said, when asked about Game 2 on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make adjustments; we\u2019re going to make adjustments.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to be aggressive.\u201d"

      "The moment the private jet carrying Lionel Messi to a lucrative sponsorship engagement in Saudi Arabia taxied onto a French runway early this week, his career at Paris St.-Germain was effectively over.",
      "The suspension would come a day later. The official parting won\u2019t happen until his contract expires in a few weeks. The blame game may go on for months.",
      "But by Wednesday there was no doubt on the main points: Messi will never play for P.S.G. again, and both the player and the club are just fine with that.",
      "The ending will not have come as a surprise to either side. Theirs had always been a business relationship, one lacking the emotional weight of Messi\u2019s previous tenure at Barcelona. And while there had been talks about renewing the forward\u2019s contract in the weeks and months after Messi led Argentina to the World Cup title in December in Qatar, neither side appeared committed to consummating a deal.",
      "But by skipping ",
      " on Monday, a day after fans in Paris had jeered the league leaders for a home loss to Lorient, a middling team that P.S.G.\u2019s stacked roster was expected to swat aside, any idea of a renewal extinguished.",
      "Mondays are traditionally a day off for P.S.G.\u2019s players after a victory. When they lose, however, the players are expected to train.",
      "By Monday afternoon, though, Messi and his family were already being photographed in Saudi Arabia, fulfilling a part of the player\u2019s multiyear contract to promote the Gulf kingdom\u2019s tourism authority. In Paris, club officials were formulating their furious response to their star\u2019s unapproved absence.",
      "By Tuesday evening, word started to spread that P.S.G. would not indulge Messi. Officially, the club has been tight-lipped. But the penalties meted out to Messi were quickly leaked: He had been suspended from practice and games for two weeks, during which time he would not receive a cent of his gargantuan salary, reported to be close to $800,000 a week. Privately, a club official said it was unlikely Messi would ever wear the club\u2019s colors again.",
      "Like P.S.G., Messi and his representatives remained publicly silent as speculation grew that their relationship was falling apart behind the scenes. Messi\u2019s camp has, though, briefed a variety of media personalities on his side of the story. Messi was under the impression that he had the club\u2019s permission to carry out his commercial endeavor, those reports said this week. Messi had decided a month ago, one reported, that he would not stay in Paris for a third season. He had even transmitted that decision to the club, the reports said.",
      "The club, meanwhile, was doing the same. The immediate concern, it seemed, was not to repair the relationship but to control the narrative. But focusing on the specifics ignored the obvious: This week\u2019s denouement represents the nadir in Messi\u2019s transactional relationship not only with P.S.G. but perhaps also with the state of Qatar. The former had heralded his arrival in Paris less than two years ago \u2014 a soft landing after Messi\u2019s budget-driven, tear-filled exit from Barcelona \u2014 as a triumph. The latter has gone to great lengths ever since to associate itself with Messi\u2019s genius.",
      "The marriage of convenience could not have gone better for player, club and country. Messi signed one of the richest contracts in sports. Qatar-owned P.S.G. added another world-class name in its to-date-fruitless search for a Champions League title. Qatar the nation, meanwhile, added a headliner before the biggest event in the country\u2019s history, the 2022 World Cup, and then watched Messi play a starring role in a tournament that ended with his being draped in a bisht \u2014 a traditional ceremonial cloak \u2014 by Qatar\u2019s emir and then paraded through the streets of Lusail like a trophy.",
      "Figures close to P.S.G. expressed surprise on Wednesday with the characterization of Messi\u2019s exit being presented on his behalf. They said it was the club that had gone slow on the idea of a contract renewal, as part of a plan to refashion the club away from its addiction to superstars like Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and toward one that is more reliant on homegrown talent. Messi\u2019s camp, they insisted, had even put a number on what it would take him to stay, proposing a salary increase that was far beyond anything the club had tentatively offered in January. By then, though, it may have been too late.",
      "Storm clouds had started to gather almost as soon as Messi returned from Qatar as a world champion. P.S.G.\u2019s form started to dip as the league season resumed in the new year, and its once-unassailable lead in the league started to shrink. The team was dumped out of the French Cup and \u2014 most frustratingly for its Qatari owners and its Parisian fans \u2014 from the Champions League, too.",
      "All the while, the jeers and whistles of the P.S.G. ultras grew louder, and the angriest voices increasingly started to focus on Messi, whose form and output \u2014 perhaps as expected for a 35-year-old coming off an exhausting World Cup \u2014 dipped below his customary brilliance.",
      "Messi watchers, part of a cottage industry attached to the player\u2019s stardom as much as his soccer prowess, have in recent weeks speculated about where he might land next season. A return to Barcelona, perhaps? An American adventure in Miami? An extended stay in Saudi Arabia? All are surely on the table now.",
      "As Messi poses for photos with his family in Riyadh, one thing is crystal clear: His future will not be in Paris."

      "For the small, insular world of triathlon, it has been a week.",
      "Last Monday, the International Testing Agency announced that Collin Chartier, a top American triathlete who had something of a breakout season last year, had tested positive for erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, a performance-enhancing substance that has long been a favorite among endurance athletes.",
      "EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells, which helps the body transport oxygen, ultimately increasing stamina. For years in professional cycling, it was about as common as saddle sores. Also, after more than two decades of doping scandals in nearly every sport, from track and field to baseball, most athletes, sports officials and fans have come to react to the latest positive test in the manner of Captain Renault entering Rick\u2019s Cafe in \u201cCasablanca.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really blown up the sport,\u201d said Dan Plews, who coaches several elite triathletes, including ",
      ", the reigning Ironman world champion.",
      "Sebastian Kienle of Germany, the 2014 Ironman world champion, pronounced himself \u201cvery sad and angry\u201d over Chartier\u2019s positive test.",
      "Andrew Messick, the chief executive of Ironman, the leading organizer of triathlons internationally, described the sport as \u201ca life-changing personal journey, not a win-at-all-cost trophy,\u201d and called Chartier\u2019s positive test \u201can assault on our most fundamental value.\u201d",
      "Other triathlon veterans said that having nearly 20 years pass without a top athlete testing positive had led them to believe that triathlon was somehow different from other sports. An endeavor requiring athletes to swim, cycle and run as many as 140.6 miles, triathlon would figure to be ideally suited for chemically aided performance enhancement. But ",
      " a former long-distance world champion, said most triathletes have long held the view that \u201cthe real race is against yourself.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cFor people focused on being the best version of yourself, cheating doesn\u2019t align with that goal. We\u2019ve never been a big-money sport, so cheating was never really incentivized.\u201d",
      ", the six-time Ironman world champion and one of the sport\u2019s first big stars, put it a little more poetically.",
      "\u201cThe essence of triathlon is personally dreaming about super excellent levels of crazy stuff, but doing it cleanly,\u201d Allen said. \u201cMaybe it is na\u00efve.\u201d",
      "Other elements to Chartier\u2019s positive test and its aftermath have also turned the situation into a major pivot point and cast serious doubt over his performances last year. Chartier, who sought refuge in the mountains of Colorado late last week, said for now he has nothing further to say publicly beyond his Instagram post and ",
      " on which he has been prominently featured during the past year.",
      "On those platforms, Chartier said he began taking EPO in November, following what he deemed a subpar performance at the Ironman world championships. Chartier said he was injured, sick and overwhelmed by the weight of expectations after his victory in the 2022 U.S. Open Cup, which earned him a $100,000 prize. Suspecting that his competitors were cheating, too, he viewed taking EPO as the only way he could compete at the highest level this year. He named no names and said he had no evidence to support his suspicions. He said he acted alone, researching how to take EPO and ordering it on the internet.",
      "Chartier refused to make an \u201cexcuse like a ",
      " or a tainted Covid vaccine,\u201d he wrote on Instagram, derisively referring to previous explanations from other athletes for failed doping tests. \u201cI made a terrible choice, and now it is time to face the consequences, own it and move on.\u201d",
      "As far as the elite competitors and the devotees at the amateur level were concerned, Chartier had pulled the pin on a grenade, tossed it into the sport\u2019s nerve center, then run, swam or cycled away.",
      "Part of that had to do with the claim that he competed cleanly last year, when, after years of mostly unspectacular performances at shorter distances, he won the full Ironman race at Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, in August as well as the Professional Triathletes Organization\u2019s U.S. Open Cup event. The U.S. Open victory in September delivered one of the season\u2019s biggest paydays in a sport where the opportunity to win significant prize money ",
      ". Chartier said he planned to keep the money because he raced clean and did not test positive until February.",
      "\u201cThis is super upsetting for athletes because of what he has stolen in prize money and recognition,\u201d Sodaro said over the weekend. \u201cHe says he wasn\u2019t doping during that period of time, that he started doping after those races and after Kona, but I think a lot of people are finding that pretty hard to believe.\u201d",
      "Part of it also had to do with his claim that he had acted without any guidance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s said no one dopes alone,\u201d Plews said. \u201cI\u2019m a physiologist, and I wouldn\u2019t dope alone.\u201d",
      "That line of thinking has broad ramifications for the sport, especially given how Chartier voiced his suspicions about other elites. Chartier\u2019s coach is Mikal Iden of Norway, whose brother, Gustav, is the reigning Ironman world champion.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not a household name but that association with a household name damages the sport,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.",
      "In an ",
      " last week, Mikal Iden said he was \u201cin shock and crying.\u201d He added, \u201cI can\u2019t distance myself enough from this action. It\u2019s such a complete crash in my values.\u201d",
      "Even triathletes with no direct connection to Chartier have found themselves playing defense.",
      "Days after Chatrier\u2019s positive test result, Sam Laidlow of France pulled out of the P.T.O.\u2019s European Open in Ibiza, Spain, scheduled for this Saturday, citing \u201cpersonal issues\u201d in a social media post, including a move to a new house. Quickly, speculation circulated that a Laidlow positive test could be the next shoe to drop.",
      "\u201cIf people question now a change of plan or me not showing up at a race and straight away put me in a box of being a cheat then that\u2019s messed up,\u201d Laidlow wrote in a follow-up post on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard my whole life and my family and I have invested so much so you can\u2019t say that freely with no foundation.\u201d",
      "Chris Kermode, the former leader of the men\u2019s tennis tour who last year became the executive chairman of the P.T.O., said this was the dynamic he feared more than any other when he took over the organization. With more money than ever now at stake in triathlon, fans and potential sponsors need to know the competition is \u201creal\u201d for the pro circuit to have any chance to grow and succeed.",
      "The outrage within the sport did betray a certain na\u00efvet\u00e9, Kermode said Monday, but also showed the passion elite triathletes have for their endeavor.",
      "\u201cThey were shocked, disgusted, and their message was loud and clear, that this is not endemic in the sport,\u201d Kermode said. \u201cIn cycling, it became something that was no surprise.\u201d",
      "He is determined not to let that happen in triathlon, and intends to have the leading experts in antidoping review his organization\u2019s program.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want ever to be in a position where people can pick holes in what we are doing,\u201d he said."

      "Ms. France, who goes by Kim, agreed to the plan, but told Mr. Green that his search would uncover her age, which wasn\u2019t listed on the app. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m older than you,\u201d she texted him days before their April 10 meeting in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park. He had no problem with that and fired back a caveat of his own: \u201cI\u2019m fat,\u201d he texted.",
      "By the time the sun was filtering through the windows of her Prospect Heights apartment on April 11, they were a couple.",
      "The careers of Ms. France and Mr. Green churn up plenty for internet sleuthing. In 1999, Ms. France, 59, was the founding editor of the Cond\u00e9 Nast shopping magazine Lucky. Today she is a writer and a host of the podcast \u201c",

He based his \u201csuper like\u201d of Ms. France on her list of favorite Spotify artists, which included the rock bands Yo La Tengo and the Velvet Underground.",

Mr. Green barely squeaked under the limbo stick. \u201cPaul had a picture of himself with Devo.\u201d Out of respect for that band, she let her celebrity rule slide.",

Their income came from Social Security checks. When he was 15, he dropped out of high school and moved in with a group of nearby musician friends. He played in local bands, but, at 23, found he liked teaching guitar better. His mother died of cancer a year after he established the School of Rock.",

She was drawn to fashion from a young age \u2014 before Lucky, she helped edit the fashion pages at New York Magazine \u2014 but she didn\u2019t love fashion magazines. \u201cI was suspicious of them because they made women feel bad about themselves.\u201d",

      "The Googling that preceded Ms. France and Mr. Green\u2019s meet-up in the park in 2021 was no guarantee of a connection. Though both were still recovering from what Mr. Green called \u201cfounder\u2019s disease\u201d \u2014 \u201cKim and I both watched something we made become something different, something more capitalistic than cultural,\u201d he said \u2014 seeing each other involved a significant commute.

      "Ms. France and Mr. Green still live in the same apartment. Three weeks into living together, both knew they wanted to marry. Three months in, they started talking about it. Ms. France mentioned that a proposal involving a drum line would be nice. Mr. Green felt that was something he could make happen, which explains why, for several months, he kept the engagement ring they picked out together in his car\u2019s glove compartment. \u201cIf I got the drum line together, it would be ready,\u201d he explained.",
      "He never got the drum line together. Instead, on Nov. 18, 2022, during a weekend trip to Philadelphia, he told her he forgot something in the glove box and asked her to look. They celebrated her yes with lunch on the road.",

Fifty guests, including Mr. Green\u2019s children, several of his students and Ms. Romolini, Ms. France\u2019s \u201cEverything is Fine\u201d co-host, attended. Ms. Nothenberg kept her remarks brief. Like everyone else in the room, she wanted to hear from the couple. \u201cThey\u2019re both clever, funny, insightful people,\u201d she said.",
      "In handwritten vows they co-wrote and took turns reading to each other, Ms. France and Mr. Green said they promised to take \u201cexquisite care\u201d of each other, and \u201cto think you are the best, so long as we both may live.\u201d",
      "Those who wanted to hear the song they cued up to play the moment they were pronounced husband and wife, ",
      " were mostly out of luck. \u201cWe played it, but people were cheering so loud for us it got drowned out,\u201d Mr. Green said.",
      "Ms. France distilled the key to their quick-to-ignite but enduring love this way: \u201cThe reason it works is we both think we\u2019re the one who got lucky.\u201d",
      " April 15, 2023",
      " Eve France\u2019s Manhattan apartment",
      " Ms. France said she surprised herself during the ceremony. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to focus, because whenever you host a party, you feel frenetic,\u201d she said. But that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cIt\u2019s a corny thing to say, but I really did feel like we were the only two people in the room.\u201d Mr. Green was likewise undistracted. \u201cWhen she said, \u2018You may kiss the bride,\u2019 the rest of the world melted away,\u201d he said.",
      " At a reception in the apartment that was meant to feel more like a cocktail party, guests nibbled hors d\u2019oeuvres and passed small plates. The signature cocktail, a spicy margarita, was a particular hit. Creative Edge Parties handled catering, including a non-cake chocolate dessert that looked like a terrarium in a cup."

      "Legislation that allows any layperson to perform a marriage on a given day in New York may not seem like a top priority in Albany. And in reality, this assumption appears to be correct: It took 16 years for legislation on a one-day designation ",
      ".",
      "But for many, the new law, which went into effect March 28, was long overdue.",
      "Previously, only ordained members of the clergy and certain government officials had been permitted to solemnize a marriage in New York. In some counties, including the five counties of New York City, people can become ordained ministers online through platforms like Universal Life Church or American Marriage Ministries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be offering a new service,\u201d said Michael McSweeney, the city clerk who oversees the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really enhance the experience for people who want to have that special loved one officiate at their ceremony without having to take the step of becoming an ordained minister of a church.\u201d",
      "Marriages performed by officiants ordained online are not legally recognized in some of the state\u2019s counties, including Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester. The new law helps couples getting married in New York avoid misunderstandings regarding the validity of nontraditional ministers.",
      "While going through a divorce, some couples found out that they had never been legally married all along. ",
      " discovered in a case by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court that their marriage and prenuptial agreement were void because the officiant had been a Universal Life Church minister.",
      "In 2006, Sandra Galef, then a Democratic assemblywoman from Ossining, N.Y., first proposed legislation on a one-day designation for a clear alternative. Such a measure passed last year, and Gov. Kathy Hochul signed it into law on Dec. 28, 2022.",
      "One-day officiants do not have to be New York State residents, but they must be at least 18 years old. ",
      "More than 40 percent of couples in the United States are married by non-clergy, Ms. Galef said in a press announcement. California, Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island all have similar laws that allow an individual to become a marriage officiant for one day.",
      "The one-day designation was an attractive option for Ray Lyn Eddington and Michael Joseph Batal because it is free from religious associations. They are getting married on April 28 on a terrace at the William Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s either city hall, a clergyperson or an ordained minister,\u201d Ms. Eddington, a doula from Brooklyn, said. \u201cBut if there are questions about ordained ministers being legal in some towns, then what do you do? This is a great option.\u201d (Mr. Batal is from Westchester, and they had initially considered getting married there.)",
      "Mr. Batal, who manages money for a private family, found out about the new law while researching ways to get a friend to officiate a wedding. He had previously officiated his brother\u2019s wedding in Massachusetts with a one-day license 20 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt brought back fond memories,\u201d he said.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal wanted Elizabeth Barnes to officiate their wedding because she had set the two up on a blind date in December 2019. They asked her on April 8, which was her 20-year anniversary of being cancer free, if she could perform their marriage.",
      "\u201cI started crying because all the things in life that you fight so hard for,\u201d said Ms. Barnes, a founder of two restaurants in New York, London Lennie\u2019s and Saltaire Oyster Bar. She has been Mr. Batal\u2019s longtime neighbor in Rye, N.Y. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that I could be there and not miss it and do it.\u201d",
      "Briana Myers, a philanthropies manager from Brooklyn, also received a one-day license from the Manhattan Marriage Bureau for Christie Mattson and Oliver Chan\u2019s April 22 wedding at Dumbo Loft in Brooklyn. The couple asked Ms. Myers to officiate because she had done some standup comedy shows. The couple wanted to commemorate the bride\u2019s father, who died and had been known for his dad jokes at family weddings. So, Ms. Myers told a few dad jokes at the ceremony in memory of Ms. Mattson\u2019s father.",
      "Out of excitement, Ms. Myers got ordained by the Universal Life Church immediately after the couple asked her to officiate in February 2022. The next step would have been to register her ordination at the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, but thanks to the new law, she didn\u2019t have to. The one-day license was more \u201cfit for purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to marry a whole bunch of other people or, set up my own place of worship.\u201d",
      "Ms. Myers said the process was much easier. \u201cIt was one form and it took five minutes.\u201d",
      "After a couple obtains a marriage license from their town or city clerk office, the officiant must apply for the one-day license at the same office and pay a $25 fee. They do not need to apply in person and can mail in the completed documents.",
      "In New York City, officiants must apply to the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, regardless of the borough in which the couple received their marriage license. They can either download the ",
      ", fill it out and sign it in front of a notary public, and mail it to the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Or, they could ",
      ", bring identification and fill out the paperwork in the office and receive the license on the spot. Each county may have a different setup, so the best first step is to visit the appropriate town or city clerk\u2019s website for guidelines.",
      "Within five days after the ceremony, the officiant must mail back the one-day license attached to the marriage license.",
      "The clerk at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau provides licensees with a script to read during the ceremony. Ms. Myers said she used \u201cthe legal sounding parts of the script\u201d during Ms. Mattson and Mr. Chan\u2019s wedding because of her \u201clack of qualifications\u201d in solemnizing a marriage.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal appreciated the personal touch that their officiant brought to their nuptials.",
      "\u201cSo much better having such a special ceremony conducted by a dear friend who didn\u2019t need to be ordained, instead of a stranger,\u201d Mr. Batal said."

      "For three weeks after they matched on Hinge in February 2020, Jhana\u00eb K-C Bonnick and Patrick Sean McDonnell tried to make plans to meet, but both were too busy with their jobs in theater. Then the ",
      " began and everything shut down.",
      "Their first date, on March 19, was a viewing of the film \u201cAlways Be My Maybe\u201d using Teleparty (formerly Netflix Party), an extension that allows subscribers in different places to watch TV shows or movies on the streaming service at the same time.",
      "Soon they were texting each other every day. At the time, Ms. Bonnick, a Broadway stage manager, lived in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, and had no work since all the theaters had shut down. She has asthma, so she was nervous about catching Covid-19. \u201cI was in my apartment with my roommate and her cats, just hanging out for a long time,\u201d she said. Mr. McDonnell was working remotely for New York Theater Workshop as a special projects associate, and living with his parents in Carle Place, N.Y., where he grew up.",
      "In search of a novel virtual activity for them to try, Mr. McDonnell came across the \u201c",
      ".\u201d (These are part of a study developed by psychologists to investigate conversations that can build intimacy between two strangers.) In mid-April, he suggested that for their first Zoom date, they ask each other the first 12.",
      "\u201cI was like, lead to \u2026 what?\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. \u201cI\u2019m panicking, texting my friends. What does this mean?\u201d",
      "Over the course of three consecutive Saturdays, they went through the entire list. Each conversation lasted around three hours.",
      "\u201cIt works,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. \u201cWe fell in love.\u201d",
      "Mr. McDonnell said he appreciated that Ms. Bonnick \u201cwas willing to answer everything with a lot of vulnerability and thoughtfulness.\u201d",
      "Recently, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell looked through the text messages they sent each other during those early months. \u201cWe were there for each other through the really weird parts of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      "They found ways to connect outside of the digital world, too. At one point, Ms. Bonnick, who rarely cooked or baked, mailed Mr. McDonnell a tin of homemade snickerdoodle cookies with a handwritten note. \u201cShe baked the cookies, she went to the post office in the middle of the pandemic, went to the trouble to overnight ship them,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cThat was the first time I thought, Is this what being in love is like?\u201d",
      "The note Ms. Bonnick sent with the cookies began a tradition that they still keep up with. Every month, on the anniversary of their first date, on March 19, Ms. Bonnick leaves a Post-it note for Mr. McDonnell to find. And Mr. McDonnell writes her notes during the run of each show she works on. (For their wedding, Ms. Bonnick made Mr. McDonnell a box full of notes and photos, and he wrote her a letter and made a digital album of 36 photos, one from every month they had been dating.)",
      "After more than three months of dating from afar, they finally met in person on Memorial Day, at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. \u201cWe talked for a long time,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. When they were saying goodbye, both were wearing masks and didn\u2019t know how to end the meeting physically. \u201cIn normal times, it would be a \u2018Do we kiss now?\u2019\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Instead, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a weird pause, and Patrick goes, \u2018Is it OK if we hug?\u2019\u201d Disappointed, Ms. Bonnick went home and told her roommate, \u201cWell, that was nice while it lasted.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick was convinced that the hug signified coldness, but she was misreading the signs. Soon after, Mr. McDonnell texted her as usual, and their romance continued. They began seeing each other regularly in person.",
      "That summer delivered a series of painful challenges that solidified their commitment to each other.",
      "Since receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater arts from State University of New York at New Paltz in 2014, Ms. Bonnick, 30, has worked in theater. In 2016, she had her big break as the production assistant for \u201cHadestown\u201d at the show\u2019s Off Broadway debut at New York Theater Workshop. She went on to work on shows like \u201cThe Cherry Orchard,\u201d \u201cCaroline, or Change\u201d and, more recently, \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d But several months into the pandemic, she was wondering if her career in theater was over. All she could think, she said, was \u201cI\u2019ve spent five years investing in something that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d",
      "She was facing challenges on a personal level as well. In late spring 2020, Ms. Bonnick\u2019s maternal grandfather, Joseph Johnson, died, and in August, her paternal grandfather, Keith Bonnick, also died. The Black Lives Matter protests that began in late May raised difficult emotions for Ms. Bonnick. And she and her roommate found out on short notice that they had to move out of their apartment.",
      "Mr. McDonnell, 28, who received a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater from Brooklyn College in 2017, had held on to his job for the New York Theater Workshop when the pandemic began. He is currently working full time as a security guard at Madison Square Garden.",
      "That summer, he faced a major health scare. \u201cI had a massive tumor growing along the side of my jaw,\u201d he said. \u201cIt started the size of a pea and by summer it was the size of a golf ball. I started going for tests. In mid-August, I had surgery to remove it.\u201d When he went in for a follow-up, the doctors told him that the lump had been an extremely rare form of cancer called secretory carcinoma. \u201cLuckily it was a clean removal,\u201d he said.",
      "Also that summer, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s grandfather on his father\u2019s side, James McDonnell, died, an event that deeply affected his family.",
      "Throughout it all, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell leaned on each other. He came to Manhattan regularly to join the Black Lives Matter protests or to help out at New York Theater Workshop, which, along with other theaters, decided to open its lobby to give protesters a place to drink water, use the bathrooms or just rest. In the evenings, he would head to Ms. Bonnick\u2019s apartment and stay overnight.",
      "That summer \u201cwas one of the ways I knew and felt very confident that the relationship was built to last,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cWe spent time together either navigating these things directly or hanging out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we wanted an escape, we could have an escape. If we wanted to plan, we could plan. If we just wanted to be safe, we could comfort each other. There wasn\u2019t any tension between us.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick said that all of the challenges they faced that summer, along with having started a relationship talking on the phone or texting and having done the 36 questions early on, built a foundation of constant communication. Check-ins became a norm. \u201cWe don\u2019t really fight now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t disagree. If we disagree, we\u2019re just having a different kind of conversation.\u201d",
      "Last summer, they started floating the idea of marriage. For Mr. McDonnell, the month of July carries particular significance. On July 2, 2008, when he was 13, Mr. McDonnell almost drowned at Jones Beach. The situation was dire enough that a helicopter evacuated him to a nearby hospital and he was kept there overnight. \u201cAround that time every year I think about what it means to be alive and to have been so close to death,\u201d he said. \u201cLast July, I knew I wanted to be married to her and I didn\u2019t want to wait much longer.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick agreed. So that August, Mr. McDonnell arranged an outing in Port Washington, N.Y., with Ms. Bonnick\u2019s parents, Karen and Hugh Bonnick; her brother Jalel Bonnick; his parents, Laura and Peter McDonnell; his aunt and uncle, Linda and Greg Pietrzak; and his cousin Jeffrey Pietrzak. His plan to propose on the dock as the sun set was almost thwarted when the arrival of Ms. Bonnick\u2019s family from Staatsburg, N.Y., where her parents live, was delayed. Luckily, they made it, with 20 minutes to spare before nightfall.",
      "\u201cHe got down on one knee at the waterfront during sunset and asked me to marry him,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Afterward, the two families, who were meeting for the first time, went for dinner nearby at Finn MacCool\u2019s.",
      "Choosing New York Theater Workshop as the venue for the wedding was easy. Mr. McDonnell worked at the theater for four years, and Ms. Bonnick worked on four shows there, including \u201cHadestown\u201d and \u201cSlave Play.\u201d \u201cThat was where we launched our careers and met many of our friends,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. (They never met through work, though Mr. McDonnell knew of Ms. Bonnick.)",
      "On March 19, 2023, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell were wed in the theater\u2019s rehearsal room in front of 44 guests. Their friend, Yang-Yang Chen, who was ordained by Open Ministry, officiated. They asked guests to test for Covid-19 if they felt unwell.",
      "When choosing the date for the wedding, Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick quickly settled on March 19, their anniversary and a Sunday this year. But what they didn\u2019t count on was Ms. Bonnick\u2019s work schedule.",
      "After the 10:30 a.m. ceremony and a brunch featuring mimosas, crepe cakes from Lady M Cake Boutique, and a coffee truck, Ms. Bonnick rushed across Manhattan, from Fourth Street to the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on West 46th Street, for a 3 p.m. preview performance of \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d Ms. Bonnick, the show\u2019s assistant stage manager, walked in wearing a white, ankle-length JessaKae dress with puff sleeves. \u201cAll of my friends, the whole stage management team, were screaming,\u201d she said. Afterward, she said, \u201cI checked the props in my wedding dress.\u201d",
      "After the show, she met Mr. McDonnell and a small group of friends and family for dinner at Dim Sum Palace on Second Avenue. At some point, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell realized that besides being their anniversary, March 19 was also the last day of winter this year. \u201cIt was the perfect time for a new beginning,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      " March 19, 2023",
      " New York Theater Workshop, New York",
      "Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick will take each other\u2019s last names, both becoming Bonnick-McDonnell. It was an \u201cimportant statement of values for us, another marker of the commitment we are making together,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said.",
      "As part of the ceremony, the couple asked guests to read passages of a poem called \u201cA Spell for Reclaiming the Moment\u201d by Adrienne Maree Brown. Ms. Bonnick\u2019s close friend and former roommate, Madeleine Foster Bersin, read a passage from ",
      "\u2019s \u201cAll About Love: New Visions.\u201d \u201cWe wanted a balance between it feeling like a traditional ceremony and it feeling distinctly our own,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said.",
      " For their rings, the couple chose aquamarine, the birthstone for March."

      "What is that thing? It is the humpbacked, bicorn hat with a strip of gold bullion to be worn by General Ghika, a decorated soldier and princely scion of the Romanian Ghica dynasty, and crowned with a swan plume.",
      "While the hat is as handsome as it is archaic, it is the plume that concerns us here. It is a thing of snowy splendor, its dozens of white (and some red) feathers graduated in size to cascade over a stiffened base, the whole engineered to catch the wind and flare in any stirring of breeze.",
      "\u201cYou will not see too many people wearing that hat,\u201d said Nathan Kashket, the director and a fourth-generation scion of Kashket & Partners in London, specialists in the design and manufacture of uniforms for ceremony and parade (as well as the scarlet tunics worn by the guards outside Buckingham Palace, the dress uniforms of the Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London and the uniforms of the Royal Horse Artillery, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment and all five regiments of the Foot Guards).",
      "And there is good reason you won\u2019t, according to Maj. Gen. Alastair Bruce of Crionaich, the governor of Edinburgh Castle and a royal commentator for Sky News. \u201cThe swan feather was selected as an adornment to headdress in order to catch the wind in the field of battle,\u201d Mr. Bruce said. In the distant days before mobile phones or walkie-talkies, \u201cit was imperative to move communications around on the battlefields and to easily identify senior commanders.\u201d",
      "A messenger at Waterloo, for instance, could readily identify the Duke of Wellington \u2014 the so-called Iron Duke, best remembered for his victory over Napoleon in 1815 \u2014 by the feathers in his hat. Thus, the cockaded bicorn became an essential element in the full-dress ceremonial uniform of the most senior general officers in the British Army. And so, inevitably, the question arises of where to obtain one.",
      "\u201cI make them,\u201d said Louis Chalmers, the proprietor of the Plumery, when reached by phone at his workshop in the Chiswick neighborhood of London. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m making one right this minute.\u201d",
      "Mr. Chalmers is 60. For more than two-thirds of his life, he has been in the business of creating plumes. He began as an apprentice at 19 and eventually purchased the business (then called Appleton Brothers) from the heirs of two former directors, expanding it to provide military plumes for the armies of Britain and Europe, the film and television industries, historical re-enactors, museums and the designer Alexander McQueen.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen our work all over and never thought about it,\u201d said Mr. Chalmers, whose company makes plumes of horsehair or humanely harvested feathers in 60 patterns for the British armed forces alone. The horsehair bristle on the Achilles hero\u2019s helmet that Brad Pitt wore in the 2004 Warner Brothers epic \u201cTroy\u201d? \u201cThat was us,\u201d Mr. Chalmers said.",
      "Yet aren\u2019t swans, he was asked, a protected species in Britain? They are. And, while members of the genus Cygnus are considered nonaggressive, experts say, they would most likely not take kindly to random plucking. \u201cThe feathers are cast and collected,\u201d General Bruce explained. \u201cGrabbing a swan and pulling the feathers I would not recommend.\u201d",
      "As it happens, the season approaches when swans naturally shed their feathers in an annual molt, a process that begins when breeding is over and the first cygnets have begun to hatch. \u201cIt\u2019s six weeks to go through the whole process,\u201d said Charlie Wheeler, the manager of Abbotsbury Swannery, a nature preserve along an eight-mile lagoon on the Dorset coast, a place thought to have been a natural swan refuge since prehistoric times and documented as such as early as 1393.",
      "Until the reign of Henry VIII and the dissolution of the monasteries, Benedictine monks cultivated swans there as deluxe comestibles. (Swan was a great banqueting delicacy.) Then the last abbot surrendered the property, and the site was passed to Sir Giles Strangways, one of whose descendants still owns it.",
      "That person, Charlotte Townshend, is among the wealthiest Britons and one of the few people, other than the monarch, entitled to own swans. The powerful vintners and dyers guilds can own them, too, and so, of course, can King Charles III, whose many titles besides ruler of the United Kingdom and head of the Commonwealth include Sovereign of the Most Noble Order of the Garter and Seigneur of the Swans. Contrary to myth, the monarch does not own every swan in England but rather can lay claim to all the unmarked birds occupying a certain stretch of the Thames and has the royal prerogative to add to those any unmarked swans in his realm.",
      "At Abbotsbury, the molting begins in June, and that is when the preserve\u2019s manager, Charlie Wheeler, and his team begin to collect the feathers.",
      "\u201cWe have anything from 600 to 800 swans on site,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be going around with buckets most days picking them up for whatever order the Plumery has made.\u2019\u2019",
      "It requires about 100 feathers to create a plume like the one General Ghika will wear, at a cost of roughly $1,200. \u201cI shave them with a scalpel,\u201d Mr. Chalmers explained, to produce an elegant cascading effect, one minute element in a spectacle grander than most are likely to witness twice in a lifetime."

      "The noonday sun sparkling off the ocean turned the lounge seating a blinding-hot version of white. The tent floorboards rumbled from the thumping D.J. booth and hooves galloping on the beach mere inches in front of the structure.",
      "A caviar-loaded tray from a server arrived for a group on the couches, their champagne bucket dripping from 80-degree heat. Tapas and liquor stations were laid out for attendees who bought three-day, $650 V.I.P. tickets to watch polo from inside the tent.",
      "\u201cNo bikinis in here unless they are covered \u2014 the dress code is sexy chic,\u201d Mr. Gauenzi said as two young women in bikinis click-clacked by, covered in netting with holes large enough for a dolphin to jump through. Barefoot beachgoers lined the edge of the playing field, marveling at polo riders speeding in packs.",
      "It was one of the biggest polo weekends of the year in the United States. The Beach Polo World Cup, held April 20 to 23rd in Miami Beach, is an official, competitive tournament that is also designed to promote the sport. About two hours away in Wellington, Fla., riders battled it out in the finals of the U.S. Open Polo Championship, one of the most prestigious polo tournaments in North America.",
      "Polo\u2019s quirky handicap system enables amateurs and professionals, of all genders and ages, to compete alongside each other at the highest levels of play. Off the field, rivalries blur quickly because hired players often switch teams during the season. And the organic camaraderie creates a sideline party scene people take as seriously as the sport.",
      " the champion Argentine polo player and former Ralph Lauren model, walked into the oceanside tent on Miami Beach, unhassled by fans.",
      "\u201cFor us, the horses are not just what we get on to play polo, but you know, it\u2019s our lifestyle,\u201d said Mr. Figueras, who breeds and trains more than 350 ponies. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of connection to that thing that is underneath me that goes beyond an animal with four legs.\u201d",
      "Polo has often been called the \u201csport of kings,\u201d and it can cost millions of dollars to move players and ponies all over the world. Polo team owners, also known as patrons, often pay for the breeding and training of 200 to 500 ponies at a time. Professional polo players are usually hired for matches or the whole season.",
      "Polo ponies gallop up to 30 miles per hour in quick bursts on grass fields the area of nine football fields, so players bring about dozen horses per match to prevent exhaustion and injury. Riders nimbly change ponies on the sidelines in seconds by swooping from one saddle to another in a graceful arc.",
      "Melissa Ganzi, an avid player in her mid-50s, was resting in the players\u2019 tent next to the field, along with a few other players zipping up boots and wiping sweat. Ms. Ganzi, a partner in the Miami event, is the founder of the World Polo League and owns private polo clubs in Aspen, Colo., and Wellington with her husband, Marc. (In Aspen, they play polo in the snow.)",

      "Another world existed in Wellington, where the crowd was as boisterous as the South Beach tent but more patrician. On one side of the field, attendees had rented private tents with cocktails and sushi and sandwiches. On the other, the members of the private Polo Club at the National Polo Center drank ros\u00e9 and Kentucky whiskey and sampled from a buffet with a caviar and blini station. The dress code was sports coat and sundress, with a few hats that seemed as large as U.F.O.s.",
      "The tables were filled with players, families and patrons who own enormous polo enterprises.",
      "\u201cWe are highly competitive,\u201d said Daniel K. Walker, the chief executive of F&M Bank in California, and a respected polo patron who owns about 50 ponies that he and his sons use. (He referred to the cost of running a polo enterprise as his \u201cmoney pit of choice.\u201d)",
      "Mr. Walker was visiting a table with a raucous Argentine group. \u201cAll of these friends are my worst enemies on the day I play against them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when the game is over, you\u2019re the best of friends.\u201d",
      "At halftime of the finals championship match during the traditional \u201cdivot stomp,\u201d when spectators try to even out the field by stepping on displaced mud and grass \u2014 usually with a drink in hand \u2014 it started pouring rain.",
      "But the deluge seemed to invigorate the partying plutocrats gathered under tents. One patron wondered, sincerely, why no one thought to hire two helicopters to dry the field by hovering back and forth.",
      "A rainy hour later, the final was officially postponed, but many guests lingered.",
      "There was no customary stampede for the parking lot, which was a good thing because valets were struggling with a few Bentleys and Alfa Romeos stuck in the mud."

      "In April, Bad Bunny wore a black one for his performance at Coachella. The corset half was sheer with visible boning. It had been customized for him by Mugler, whose creative director, Casey Cadwallader, introduced the style into the brand\u2019s collection in 2022.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very weird hybrid,\u201d he said. Wearing it zipped up can feel like \u201ca back brace at the gym,\u201d but wearing it open feels like any other hoodie, only \u201ca little more fierce, and also a little more comical.\u201d",
      "Mr. Cadwallader was working from a studio in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, overseeing fittings for a fashion show meant to introduce the H&M collection, when the model Paloma Elsesser arrived for her fitting wearing her own corset hoodie, maroon and emblazoned with \u201cNew York.\u201d This one was made by a young Irish designer named Timothy Gibbons.",

      "\u201cCertainly people are like, Oh, I\u2019m not into art,\u201d Ms. Hessel said of talking to strangers about her work. \u201cBut you know, I tell them if you just look at this picture, we can talk about it, and something might spark your interest.\u201d",
      "Ms. Hessel fell in love with art at a young age. When she was 6, she recalled seeing Louise Bourgeois\u2019s spider at the Tate Modern Turbine Hall in London with her older sister, nine years her senior. In her teen years in London, Ms. Hessel was obsessed with self-starting teen culture mavens like Tavi Gevinson and began keeping extensive notes and diaries of exhibitions she saw. But it wasn\u2019t until Ms. Hessel graduated with a degree in art history from University College London in 2015 when she realized how little she knew about female artists. The book she\u2019d grown up paging through at her parents\u2019 home, \u201cThe Story of Art\u201d",
      "by E.H. Gombrich, featured only one woman in its 688 pages (even in its 16th edition).",
      "In October 2015, Ms. Hessel started an Instagram account with the handle @thegreatwomenartists as a means to educate herself about the likes of Corita Kent, Amrita Sher-Gil, Deborah Roberts and more. The account, which was inspired by Linda Nochlin\u2019s 1971 essay in Art News, \u201c",
      "\u201d and artist activists like the ",
      ", has since amassed more than 330,000 followers. After Instagram, Ms. Hessel launched a podcast, born from her desire to meet her heroes. Now in its ninth season with over 100 episodes, Ms. Hessel has interviewed everyone from Marina Abramovi\u0107 \u2014 \u201cWe bonded over our love for Yorkshire tea and had some wasabi peas,\u201d she said \u2014 to Loretta Pettway Bennett and Mary Margaret Pettway of the Gee\u2019s Bend Quiltmakers.",
      "Written during the pandemic, \u201cThe Story of Art Without Men\u201d felt like a natural next step after the popularity of her other projects. Ms. Hessel doesn\u2019t have a Ph.D., so she treated the writing of her book as an excuse to act like she was getting one. She mulled questions like: Who gets to be an artist? Who gets to be an art historian? The acknowledgments section of the book is especially long, Ms. Hessel said, because she spent so much time fact-checking with experts. \u201cThe beauty about writing it during lockdown was the fact that I had access to so many scholars who could discuss it with me,\u201d she said.",
      "Does creating a book entirely for non-male artists contribute to their marginalization within art history? Ms. Hessel did consider that possibility. \u201cOf course it is contributing to putting people in a box, absolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do think that we have to go overboard in order to make an equal society one day.\u201d She hopes that one day in the future there will be enough gender parity and representation in the art world that children will wonder why a book like hers was ever necessary.",

      "On a recent evening, about 75 people gathered at the National Arts Club, a private club in a landmark building on East 20th Street in Manhattan, to see her read from her new memoir, \u201cRebel Soul: Musings, Music, & Magic,\u201d and sing some of her songs.",
      "The neighborhood was familiar to Ms. Buell. Soon after she arrived in New York from Camp Lejeune, N.C., in 1972, she became a regular at ",
      ", the famed night spot just a few blocks away. At the time she was an 18-year-old model signed to the Eileen Ford Agency who lived at the St. Mary\u2019s Residence on the Upper East Side. The place had a curfew enforced by nuns, but one night Ms. Buell slipped out and made her way to Max\u2019s, where she would end up partying with Andy Warhol, Lou Reed, ",
      ", and David Johansen and Johnny Thunders of the New York Dolls.",
      "She went from It Girl of Manhattan to Miss November in Playboy magazine. She had relationships with Todd Rundgren, Elvis Costello, Steven Tyler, Jimmy Page, Mick Jagger and Rod Stewart in the years when they did some of their best work, but she writes in her book that she was more than a muse and was unfairly labeled a groupie by the press.",
      "The people who went to see her at the National Arts Club seemed to feel the same way. One of them, Dick Wingate, a former music executive, said that, back in 1980, he had tried to get his colleagues at Epic Records to release Ms. Buell\u2019s four-song EP, \u201cCovers Girl,\u201d but ran into resistance. \u201cI really think she was a trailblazer in many ways,\u201d Mr. Wingate said. \u201cShe just said, \u2018I\u2019m going to do what I\u2019m going to do and I don\u2019t care what people think,\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t easy at that point in time.\u201d",
      "These days, Ms. Buell, 69, lives near Nashville with her husband, James Wallerstein (stage name: Jimmy Walls), 56, a soft-spoken guitarist and director of concierge services at a luxury residential building. The couple said they had made the long drive to Manhattan in a rented S.U.V. with their two dogs, Chicken Burger, 15, and Lola, 11, in the back seat. Late Wednesday afternoon, in the high-ceiling suite where they were staying on the seventh floor of the National Arts Club, Ms. Buell was getting ready for the party.",
      "At 6 p.m. the early arrivals trickled into the brightly lit East Gallery on the ground floor. David Croland, a photographer and fashion illustrator, said he had met Ms. Buell in 1972, when he was hired to body-paint her for a Ziegfeld Follies-inspired benefit. \u201cShe was never a groupie,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had her own groupies. She would just appear and people would line up.\u201d",
      "He saw someone across the room: \u201cDanny! Danny!\u201d It was ",
      ", a pivotal rock music figure who had managed or worked closely with Jim Morrison, the Stooges, the Velvet Underground and the Ramones. \u201cShe was a champion of discovering and allying herself with beautiful and talented and wonderful people,\u201d Mr. Fields said of Ms. Buell. \u201cShe was smart, sexy and beautiful, with elegant taste. I never wondered why everyone was in love with her.\u201d",
      "The guest of honor stepped into the room dressed in black: a Calvin Klein jacket, fringed opera gloves that she had made herself, and a vintage Norma Kamali skirt.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d Ms. Buell said.",
      "She planted herself at Mr. Wingate's side. Long after the fact, she still appreciated his efforts on behalf of \u201cCovers Girl,\u201d which came out in 1981 on Rhino Records, then an independent label known for novelty releases.",
      "\u201cWhen everybody in the business was wondering if that rock-star girlfriend, that Playboy girl, can be a rock person, or whatever, Dick Wingate had vision,\u201d Ms. Buell said. \u201cHe was smart.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, Bebe,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re so sweet to say that.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow am I going to make you proud tonight?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard for this moment. I know that we can\u2019t do records together anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, you\u2019re a real inspiration to a lot of people.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t make me cry before I go on,\u201d she said.",
      "The guests took their seats as Ms. Buell climbed onto a small stage.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting married here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve already cried twice. So I probably look like a wreck.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been a \u2018rebel, rebel,\u2019 right?\u201d Ms. Buell said, alluding to the ",

      "She was joined onstage by a longtime friend, the publicist Liz Derringer, the ex-wife of the rock guitarist Rick Derringer. Decades ago she introduced Ms. Buell to a high school friend, Mr. Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith, who became the father of Ms. Buell\u2019s daughter, the actress Liv Tyler.",
      "Ms. Derringer led Ms. Buell through some highlights of \u201cRebel Soul,\u201d which covers her nights with various rockers as it charts her progress toward finding her own voice. The book also goes into what Ms. Buell describes as her \u201cmany experiences with extraterrestrial entities.\u201d For the National Arts Club crowd, she mixed in claims of her U.F.O. encounters with stories about Mr. Rundgren and other exes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been painted as this wild filly that was running around with the rock stars,\u201d Ms. Buell said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that wasn\u2019t the reality of what was going on. I was a young girl that would talk her head off. I wanted Todd to be a boyfriend that didn\u2019t go out with other women but that was impossible in those times.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were so young,\u201d Ms. Derringer said, \u201cand it was the early \u201970s.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was 18, he was 23, and we were all gorgeous,\u201d Ms. Buell said. \u201cThe hormones were raging. There was so much beauty in New York. When Johnny Thunders walked across the room when he was 19, it caused you to take a breath. The Italian stallion, just something about him. And he had on pink satin pants and my girlfriend\u2019s boots!\u201d",
      "\u201cI also had a lot of platonic relationships,\u201d she continued. \u201cFriendships with Bowie and others that were deep.\u201d",
      "Ms. Buell read a chapter on her friendship with Prince, whom she said she had met backstage in the mid-70s when Mr. Rundgren\u2019s band Utopia was playing in Minneapolis. Prince was shy, not yet famous, and he told Ms. Buell that she would one day see his name in lights. Before they parted, according to her book, he whispered that he thought the pictures of her in Playboy were very pretty.",
      "Ms. Buell teared up as she finished the chapter: \u201cI still cry about him and Bowie,\u201d she said.",
      "Mr. Wallerstein, carrying a Gibson acoustic guitar, stepped close to her, as did another guitarist, Gyasi Heus, who, with his flowing locks and red pants, looked as if he would have been at home in the Max\u2019s Kansas City of yore. They played as Ms. Buell sang songs she had written with her husband and others in Nashville \u2014 \u201cBy a Woman,\u201d \u201cCross My Legs\u201d and \u201cCan You Forgive,\u201d among others.",
      "Toward the end of her set, she turned to her accompanists, saying, \u201cAll right, guys, I\u2019m doing this a cappella.\u201d After asking them not to leave the stage, she told the crowd: \u201cI just think they should stay there, because they look so gorgeous. Gorgeous rock boys. There\u2019s nothing like gorgeous rock boys!\u201d",
      "The final song was \u201cSuperstar,\u201d a 1971 hit for the Carpenters about a lonesome groupie pining away for a rock star. Ms. Buell encouraged everyone to join her for the chorus:",
      "Big applause.",
      "Beverly Keel, a friend of Ms. Buell\u2019s who is a dean at Middle Tennessee State University, said: \u201cTo me, her whole life has been defined by her relationships with other people. She\u2019s Liv\u2019s mom, Todd Rundgren\u2019s girlfriend, Steven Tyler, mother of his child. And now she\u2019s finally being recognized for who she\u2019s been all along.\u201d",
      "After signing copies of her book, Ms. Buell seemed ready to call it a night. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a 15-year-old dog upstairs. I\u2019ve got to check on Chicken Burger and I\u2019ve got to change clothes.\u201d",
      "The entertainment journalist Roger Friedman, a longtime champion of Ms. Buell, had a suggestion: \u201cYou know what you need? You need an electric violin.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, I could get that,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cYou need an electric violin,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThat would be perfect.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, you can\u2019t overuse those suckers,\u201d Ms. Buell said. \u201cYou only bring them in when you need to cry.\u201d"

      "The light of many flash bulbs reflected off the bottles, lighting Mr. Luhrmann\u2019s face as he fluffed Ms. Kidman\u2019s train, gesturing with his hands, softly, toward her face. Ms. Kidman, who starred in Mr. Luhrmann\u2019s films \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d and \u201cAustralia,\u201d poked her chin up, meeting the director\u2019s hand in midair.",
      "The role of muse is one Ms. Kidman knows well: She was also one of Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s muses, though she humbly deflected about the title when asked if she considered herself as such, preferring to talk about how much he taught her.",

      ", as she exited the exhibition and headed to the cocktail party in the American Wing of the museum. She clutched the train of her dress, designed by Mr. Lagerfeld for a Chanel No. 5 commercial Mr. Luhrmann directed. \u201cKarl knew me and he was able to design for me, but he was also really playful and fun. It was just lovely in the same way as being around someone like Stanley Kubrick.\u201d",
      "Supermodels like Kate Moss cherished the intimacy they shared with Mr. Lagerfeld. Ms. Moss recalled working with the designer, as well as his infamous largess.",

      "While Mr. Ford can narrow it down to two women, the Nigerian singer Tems, who wore a feathered Robert Wun gown, said she finds creative inspiration in everyone.",
      "\u201cWe gain inspiration from everybody \u2014 it\u2019s a universal thing.\u201d Tems said, while chatting with Gabrielle Union, who wore a red Prada get-up. \u201cWe are all connected. You can see somebody right now, and then you gain inspiration from that. We are all muses in our own right, whether we know it or not.\u201d"

      " said with a broad smile rather than any evident terror. It was six weeks before the release of her new self-titled album, and the biggest singer in contemporary Christian music (CCM) was sitting in a lounge at the midtown Manhattan offices of Atlantic Records, glowing with positivity.",
      "Daigle, a vivacious 31-year old with a whimsical streak that\u2019s evident in her colorful wardrobe, has crossed over into the pop world with greater success than anyone since ",
      ". But this is the first time she\u2019s written love songs that aren\u2019t about religious faith, and she\u2019s worried that people will hear them as references to her personal life, rather than ruminations about universal experiences.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all about writing songs to help people through things they\u2019re questioning,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cLauren Daigle,\u201d due May 12, will also be her debut on a major label, after releasing three albums on Centricity Music, a Nashville indie, and it will likely propel her further into the public eye. Later this year, she\u2019ll headline her first arena tour.",
      "The United States has become a much more divided and combustible country since Grant\u2019s heyday, and Daigle is no newcomer to navigating the lion\u2019s den. She has been caustically criticized within the Christian community for some of her choices, especially for ",
      " ",
      " hosted by a lesbian celebrity, in 2018. All performers are carefully scrutinized in the social media age, but CCM artists live under a unique microscope, and much of the audience is unforgiving.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the stress artists are under now,\u201d said Brandon Woolum, the managing editor of the long-running publication CCM Magazine. \u201cThey have to make sure they don\u2019t say that wrong thing that gets them canceled.\u201d Any article his site runs about Daigle or Grant draws complaints from readers, Woolum added. \u201cPeople are ",
      "mad at Amy.\u201d",
      "Even in the past, some Christian artists, notably Grant and the stars Sandi Patty and Michael English, have been repudiated by fans for having affairs or getting divorced. English later denounced the Christian music industry as \u201ca sick world.\u201d Is Daigle worried that one mistake could damage her career in CCM?",
      "\u201cYes, one million-trillion percent,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a long time, I lived my life confined, to make sure people think highly of me, and it made me miserable.\u201d Her new mission is to remain unrestrained.",
      "Daigle grew up amid the brackish wetlands of Lafayette, La., counting alligators on the drive over to visit her grandparents, and for her new album, she wanted to redirect her music away from light, acoustic soft-rock toward a more soulful, Southern sound. She recorded the album, and another that will follow in the late summer, with the producer Mike Elizondo, whose credits include Fiona Apple and Carrie Underwood, as well as Eminem and 50 Cent.",
      "She wrote some songs with ",
      ", a Nashville hitmaker who is gay. And because the themes on her album are less faith-based than in the past, she knows some will count what\u2019s referred to in the CCM world as JPMs (mentions of Jesus Per Minute) and find the music too worldly.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen people ask, \u2018Is Lauren Daigle even a Christian anymore?,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s to be expected, so it doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d",
      "In a radio interview after the DeGeneres fracas, Daigle summed up her view of Scripture. Anyone who expected her to shun gay people had \u201ccompletely missed the heart of God,\u201d she said. \u201cBe who Christ was to everyone as well.\u201d This brought more opprobrium, including a ",
      " that scoffed, \u201cLauren, dear sister in Christ, you failed this test.\u201d",
      "Does Daigle, who identifies as nondenominational, feel that Christ\u2019s messages have been widely corrupted? \u201cOh, absolutely. I have seen people use what He said to promote an agenda and keep people controlled. You have a lot of power if you\u2019re telling someone their eternal destiny.\u201d",
      "Grant, a friend, praised Daigle\u2019s \u201clovely\u201d voice, adding that \u201cthe dynamics of her own life give her a deep compassion for other people.\u201d As for the criticisms Daigle has faced, \u201cMy response is, God is good, people are a mess \u2014 all of us.\u201d",
      "Christian rock began in the late 1960s and early \u201970s, when it was known as \u201cJesus Music,\u201d a grass-roots movement led by longhaired hippie outsiders. It gradually built its own infrastructure of record stores, media, festivals and radio stations. Major labels took notice, and began to buy up Christian labels or start imprints of their own.",
      "The first schism came over the Amy Grant generation of crossover artists who played songs that could be interpreted as devout or romantic, a middle ground known derisively in some CCM circles as the \u201cJesus is my boyfriend\u201d or the \u201cGod or a girl\u201d phenomenon. But Daigle\u2019s crossover, close observers say, was different.",
      "\u201cLauren represented a new type of stardom on unapologetically confessional terms,\u201d said Joshua Kalin Busman, an assistant professor of music history at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. \u201cShe left no ambiguity in her music and spoke transparently about her personal relationship to God.\u201d",
      "As a child, Daigle dismissed Christian music as cheesy. She was raised in a religious home that welcomed secular music, as long as there \u201cweren\u2019t F-bombs every five seconds,\u201d she said. She got in trouble a lot at school, for cheating or talking too much. She believes she has ADHD, and also mentions \u201csome OCD\u201d and a few episodes of depression.",
      "As her interest in music grew, she cleaned her church choir director\u2019s bathroom in exchange for singing lessons. But she also became ill, with symptoms that included extreme fatigue, jaundice and worsening vision. She eventually learned she had cytomegalovirus, a chronic illness, and began home-schooling using a syllabus and a set of VHS tapes as her guide: \u201cThat was the season that changed the trajectory of my life.\u201d",
      "She started reading the Bible and had visions of herself as a music star. \u201cI could literally see stages and tour buses. I said, \u2018God, are you showing me this, or am I losing my mind?\u2019 I think it was God, because everything I saw has come to pass.\u201d",
      "In 2010 and 2012, she was an untelevised contestant on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d She also enrolled at Louisiana State University and sang background vocals with the Assemblie, a U2-ish Christian rock group in Baton Rouge, which drew the attention of Centricity Music.",
      "Her first single, ",
      " hit No. 5 on Billboard\u2019s Christian singles chart, the first of 14 songs that have breached its Top 10, including five No. 1s, a record for a female singer. ",
      " from 2018, spent 129 weeks as the most popular Christian song, and reached Number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100. It has a brooding, almost gothic quality, and showcases her flexible alto, which is full of range and power and often draws comparisons to Adele.",
      "\u201cYou Say\u201d was still ruling the Christian chart when the pandemic began. As with her first outbreak of cytomegalovirus symptoms, isolation and illness proved transformative.",
      "In November 2020, Daigle appeared at a New Orleans worship event organized by Sean Feucht, a provocateur who used \u201creligious freedom\u201d as an excuse to challenge lockdown regulations, and she faced ",
      ". As with the DeGeneres flap two years earlier, Daigle cried for days, she told me.",
      "A year later, Daigle contracted the coronavirus and had migraines for months. Her post-Covid symptoms were worse. She used to go skydiving and cliff jumping, but now she suffered panic attacks, anxiety and bouts of paranoia. She started counseling, and simultaneously wrestled with the question of why so many white Evangelicals supported Donald Trump, and the attendant divisiveness in the country.",
      "\u201cDealing with post-Covid symptoms paired with the animosity that plagued our nation brought me to one of the lowest points of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to do a deep dive on who I was.\u201d",
      "Eventually, Daigle began to feel divine love present in the care showed by people close to her, and she wrote \u201cThank God I Do,\u201d a bruised ballad that\u2019s one of the highlights of her self-titled album.",
      "Her two health crises strengthened her \u201ctenacity and resilience,\u201d she said. Criticism and rejection reinforced her resolve to follow a personal understanding of Scripture, rather than that of a church or minister, a practice that goes back hundreds of years, to the founding of Protestantism.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not to say that criticism and animosity doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d she concluded, \u201cbut I do have that confidence piece that will always get me back up on my feet.\u201d"

      "It was a happy fallout of Covid.",
      "During the pandemic shutdown, the filmmaker ",
      " and his wife, the actress ",
      ", hunkered down in their home on the Marin County coast of California. The photography dealer ",
      " and his husband, Alan Mark, a real-estate consultant, relocated from San Francisco to their weekend house in a neighboring town. The two couples, who knew each other casually, began spending more time together.",
      "One evening, Fraenkel asked if Coen and McDormand were familiar with the work of ",
      " At 88, Friedlander is ",
      " whose pictures Fraenkel has been exhibiting for more than 40 years.",
      "\u201cI thought Lee was ripe for an outside approach and inviting a filmmaker seemed like the way to go,\u201d Fraenkel said of his matchmaking inspiration. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s seen Joel\u2019s movies knows he has a special eye for images.\u201d",
      "Although the subjects of Friedlander\u2019s black-and-white photographs since the early \u201960s have been wide-ranging \u2014 public monuments, motel rooms, party scenes, portraits, self-portraits, nudes and landscapes \u2014 what unites them is his unerring sense of composition. In his ability to create harmonious wholes out of urban fragments, he is the contemporary heir to Eug\u00e8ne Atget, who memorialized Paris in the early 20th century. Like Atget, too, Friedlander finds unexpected juxtapositions in the reflections in plate-glass windows.",
      "The witty and carefully crafted movies that Coen has written and directed \u2014 most with his brother, Ethan, including \u201cBarton Fink,\u201d \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d\u2014 display a similar flair for revealing the mystery in what might seem at first glance to be ordinary and banal.",
      "Fraenkel\u2019s question about Friedlander landed on fertile ground. \u201cI certainly knew of him, and I think Fran did a little,\u201d Coen said recently, in a joint video interview with McDormand from California. \u201cJeffrey floated the idea of doing a show of Lee\u2019s photographs. He said it could be whatever you want. \u2018Just 10 photographs if you like.\u2019 \u201d",
      "Coen and McDormand visited the Friedlanders in New City, N.Y., to make sure they were simpatico. The meeting was a great success. \u201cThey came here with Jeffrey,\u201d Friedlander recalled. \u201cWe were ready for them with food, but they brought food, too. We had a sort of picnic indoors. When Joel and I met, we both thought we might have known each other. We didn\u2019t, but we were so familiar with each other.\u201d",
      "Over the last year, Coen expanded the project into a sequenced book of 70 Friedlander photos, \u201c",
      " that is the basis for two exhibitions, at the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco, from May 6 through June 24, and at ",
      " in New York, from May 13 to June 24. Each show will display about 45 photos.",
      "Coen began by leafing through books of Friedlander pictures and decided to arrange the new book to draw attention to Friedlander\u2019s compositional approaches. \u201cLooking through these books and going back and forth, it was a pattern recognition for me \u2014 patterns which I know are instinctive but are manifold in everything he does,\u201d he said.",
      "He began with the artist\u2019s simplest formal structures and advanced into greater complexity. \u201cThe first thing I noticed was the splitting,\u201d Coen explained. Friedlander repeatedly organizes a picture with a vertical post dividing the frame. \u201cThe post, the post,\u201d Coen continued. \u201cThen I see the posts are slightly diagonal, and the affinity between the diagonal post and how car interiors are designed. Then I see how he uses diagonal shadows like the posts. Now I see how he is using television screens like windows. Now I see how he is using light to define the same areas.\u201d As the book unfolds, the themes and variations become evident.",
      "\u201cBecause he\u2019s a filmmaker, he would show me the sequences on an iPad,\u201d McDormand recalled of the way her husband storyboarded the book.",
      "In addition to the book, Coen created for the two gallery shows what he calls a \u201cflip book\u201d \u2014 a three-and-a-half-minute video of images arranged in an order that highlights these strategies.",
      "To learn what the artist thinks of Coen\u2019s curatorial approach, I traveled to suburban Rockland County on the west side of the Hudson to pay a call on Friedlander and his wife, Maria Friedlander, driving down a wooded road, past an apple orchard, to the rambling 1947 house faced with brown shingle and stone from a local quarry that they have inhabited for over half a century.",
      "Friedlander said he found Coen\u2019s observations intriguing. \u201cI tend to put posts in,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe says all kinds of nice things that I don\u2019t recognize. Splitting, splintering. Evidently my pictures are that way, but I didn\u2019t think, \u2018I want to take a splintering picture.\u2019 If you\u2019ve done the same thing for 60 years, you don\u2019t think of motive very much. I just walk and see something interesting.\u201d",
      "Friedlander works with film. Unlike a digital photographer, an artist who shoots film doesn\u2019t see the images until the film is processed and printed on contact sheets. Photography thrives on accidents; there can be surprises. \u201cIn one photograph, the reflection looks like part of the building,\u201d Friedlander said of \u201cAlbany, New York, 1967,\u201d a picture that Coen chose for the book. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice until I printed it.\u201d",
      "Friedlander is the most cerebral of photographers, making intricate images marked by divisions, reflections and repetitions; and yet, discussing his work, he insists that none of this is on his mind when he takes the picture. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great game,\u201d he said. \u201cAs complicated as a picture could get, it\u2019s done in 1/100th of a second \u2014 or less.\u201d",
      "When asked about this paradox, Coen said, \u201cI\u2019m extremely sympathetic to Lee\u2019s point of view in how he thinks about his own work. It comes up with any writer, photographer or filmmaker, because you\u2019re always asked to analyze your own process or the obsessions of your own work. I\u2019ve always been very much of the opinion that the obligation of the person who makes the work is to make the work, and the obligation of the people who view the work is to think about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not living retrospectively,\u201d McDormand interjected. \u201cYou\u2019re living alive in the moment, creating something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut when I look at someone else\u2019s work, I take on the mantle of the opposite side of the fence,\u201d Coen continued. \u201cWhether you intended it or not, I\u2019m telling you what I see and what I\u2019m drawn to.\u201d",
      "A still photographer and a filmmaker have very different aims, Coen said. \u201cI take photos with my iPhone like everybody else, but I was looking at a visual form that I have no connection to. The primary thing in cinematography is a narrative, and everything else is secondary. Often the director of photography will set up a shot that is so beautiful but so deficient from a narrative point of view.\u201d And the shot is scrapped.",
      "Coen said that Friedlander\u2019s photographs are animated with his idiosyncratic wit. \u201cThey are extremely cerebral, they are extremely formal,\u201d he explained. \u201cAt the same time, they have a sense of humor, a very delicate one. For that reason, they\u2019re not cold. I love the fact that they\u2019re so complicated that way, but he doesn\u2019t talk about them analytically.\u201d",
      "McDormand is drawn to the long, close marriage of the Friedlanders, who were wed in 1958. \u201cI think Jeffrey was interested in us meeting them,\u201d she said. She remarked that for her, this was a story about three married couples. \u201cThe six of us, we don\u2019t have to do anything we don\u2019t want to do,\u201d she said. She was especially moved by Lee\u2019s portraits of Maria, in particular \u201cMaria, Las Vegas, 1970,\u201d which is also in the new book.",
      "\u201cThere is a tenderness,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the most resonant ones, for both of us, is his shadow across her partially nude body. For me, and then meeting them, that photograph is resonant to their whole relationship.\u201d",
      "Friedlander continues to photograph, and six days a week, he prints from his old negatives in a spacious darkroom he constructed in the basement of his house. \u201cI love working,\u201d he said. The prints he is making now are of the landscapes he photographed 20 years ago in the West \u2014 thick tangles of branches, boulders and pine needles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still shooting the same subjects when I go out west,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more jumble, the better I like them \u2014 if they work. I don\u2019t want to repeat Ansel Adams. It wouldn\u2019t be any fun to do that.\u201d",
      "Images like \u201cAlbany, New York, 1967,\u201d where a woman stands by a post that divides a row of tall buildings from the mirrored reflection of other tall buildings, or \u201cCalifornia, 1970,\u201d with the diagonal struts of Plexiglas pay-phone enclosures interrupting and refracting the city scene, organize urban chaos miraculously. Coen said that as he perused Friedlander\u2019s photographs, he thought at one point, \u201c\u2018These are impossible compositions. How does it happen that these things that seem to be so impossible are so perfect?\u2019 Thinking more about an artist I admire was the whole motivation.\u201d"

One could make the case \u2014 as I did in the headline \u2014 that this is an episode about the ends and beginnings of relationships. But the subplots nonetheless felt more like separate pieces than parts of a whole.",

      "\u2019s discovery that Total Football with Jamie as facilitator rather than scorer is a winning recipe. (To underline the point we hear the play-by-play of Jamie passing to Dani for a goal.) Moments later, we learn the win streak is up to four.",

He\u2019s in the pub with his ex-wife, Michelle, and her new beau \u2014 and their former marriage counselor \u2014 Dr. Jacob. \u201cPlease, I insist, call me Jake,\u201d he tells Ted, proving that he is just as bad at reading a room as he is at meeting a minimal standard of professional ethics.",
      "Michelle and Jake are dropping off Henry with Ted as they take a surprise trip to Paris. (\u201cJake told me on the plane,\u201d Michelle explains.) Ted may not know much about Europe, but he is confident of this arithmetic: Paris + newish couple = marriage proposal. This assumption is confirmed when, asked where they would propose if they could do so \u201canywhere in the world,\u201d Trent and Roy in unison cite the City of Lights.",

Once the others learn that an engagement is merely Ted\u2019s assumption, they agree to follow Higgins\u2019s advice to \u201cfind out before you flip out.\u201d It\u2019s OK, though, because this meeting is largely a setup for \u2026 But no, that would be getting ahead of ourselves.",

      "Granted the wish to do whatever he wants on a day that Ted and Beard are taking off, Henry opts for a Premier League game and, wouldn\u2019t you know, the only team playing is Rupert and Nate\u2019s West Ham United. So the fellas go to the game, deck out Henry in a West Ham jersey, and shout and wave to get Nate\u2019s attention on the sideline. Again, more on this soon.",

      ", which Beard then helpfully unpacked for Henry before advising him, \u201cI know right now it feels like you\u2019re in a sad song. But you, young man, you have the power to take a sad song and make it better.\u201d",
      "Ted has by now absented himself to call Rebecca, who had texted to say she had \u201cinfo.\u201d Its precise nature, however, was apparently revealed to Ted while we were Beatling with Beard and Henry. The most we hear from Rebecca is, \u201cBut seriously, who gives a flying [expletive] if Michelle gets engaged,\u201d which is suggestive but not dispositive.",
      "Is the omission deliberate and, if so, what is it intended to accomplish? Time will tell. But the tug that Henry exerts on his father\u2019s heart, while scarcely new, is ever more evident \u2014 in particular during the goodbyes that close the episode, when Ted can scarcely let go of Henry\u2019s backpack.",
      "When we first run across Nate this episode, he is in bed in the morning. Moreover, he is not alone but with Jade, our favorite hostess at Nate\u2019s favorite Greek restaurant. Upon waking, she quickly determines that, charmingly, Nate had already gotten up, showered, shaved, brushed his teeth and gotten back into bed. Alas, love-struck boy that he is, he quickly falls into the trap of trying to \u201clabel\u201d the \u201crelationship\u201d while claiming he\u2019s trying to do no such thing. Slow down, tiger.",
      "I confess I feel somewhat disappointed that we went directly from Jade not standing Nate up at dinner to the two comfortably ensconced in bed for what is evidently not the first time. (Indeed, in a later scene, she accedes to the label \u201cboyfriend.\u201d) We have not yet seen a single real conversation between the two, a glimpse of why it is they enjoy each other\u2019s company. We\u2019ve gone straight from romantic tension to romantic fulfillment without witnessing the romantic journey at all, at least so far.",
      "Which is perhaps part of the reason Nate\u2019s most moving relationship is still his complicated one with Ted. I noted ",
      " that even as we watched Good Nate\u2019s re-emergence from Bad Nate, it had been some time since we\u2019d seen him at work at West Ham. Could Good Nate survive in the malignant shadow of Rupert?",
      "Smitten, he evidently can, even if only briefly and only with Rupert absent. Nate gathers a couple of subordinates together for a meeting of the \u201cLove Hounds,\u201d a shameless rip-off of \u2026well, I hardly need to tell you. It goes about as well as one might expect, which is to say that the drop-off from the \u201cDiamond Dogs\u201d \u2014 I told you we\u2019d get here \u2014 is comparable to that between Alvy Singer\u2019s first and second ",
      " in \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d Does the awkward fiasco remind Nate of what made his time at Richmond with Ted special? Oh yes, it most assuredly does.",
      "And in case he abruptly forgot, he gets another reminder when Ted, Beard and West-Ham-clothed Henry show up at his match. Visibly stunned at first, he then briefly allows a small smile past his lips.",
      "Yet it\u2019s soon clear that Nate still has a way to go. When Rupert later texts him, \u201cSorry about Ted being there. Won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Nate begins to type, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I thought it was funny.\u201d But even that level of moderate snark seems insufficient. So Nate deletes it in favor of a corporately cold \u201cGood. Thank you.\u201d",
      "Still, his ongoing path seems clear. Even in the aforementioned \u201cboyfriend\u201d scene with Jade, what lingers is the smile on his face as he looks at a news photo of Ted, Henry and Beard at the match.",
      "Did I mention the preponderance of red flags in this relationship last week? Why, yes I did. But whether or not the relationship is actually over, as this episode suggests it may be, the developments are connected only peripherally to Jack\u2019s creepily over-the-top love-bombing.",
      "Rather, we have what could be called a fairly literal \u201cghost in the machine\u201d: a selfie sex video Keeley filmed for a past paramour that has made its way onto the internet and, by extension, Keeley\u2019s phone. Keeley is mortified and begs the seemingly omnipotent \u2014 read: ultrarich \u2014 Jack to fix the situation. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take care of it,\u201d Jack promises.",
      "But the photos ripple outward quickly. When Sam tells the rest of the team, Roy leaves the room angrily while Jamie looks worried. Could the latter be wondering what terrifying vengeance the former might be contemplating? Jamie doesn\u2019t know about the rope-dipped-in-red-paint scenario, but he had firsthand experience with the genitalia strings.",
      "But no, it\u2019s simpler than that. Jamie is genuinely concerned, as he expresses near the end of the episode \u2014 and concerned not only that the video was leaked but that he may have been unintentionally responsible. Keeley had sent it to him, of course, and he confirms that his password is the highly crackable \u201cpassword,\u201d even if he cunningly disguised it by using two \u201cS\u201des. For anyone rooting for a Jamie-Keeley reunion, this is a clearly promising scene. For the rest of us \u2026",
      "Roy is genuinely angry, and not merely at the leak but at what was leaked. He approaches Keeley and, after saying all the right things, moves on to say precisely the wrong thing: \u201cWho\u2019s it for?\u201d \u2014 a question to which he has almost certainly guessed the answer. Keeley promptly exits, and who could blame her?",
      "An overdue aside here: What in the world is the show doing with Roy and with Keeley? The original sin was not merely breaking up the two of them, but doing it at the start of this season (and ",
      " offhandedly) rather than at the end of last one, when the emotional impact would have been exponentially greater. The show has only compounded that misstep with how it has presented each character since \u2014 let me start with Roy and then return to Keeley at the end of the section.",
      "I made the case last season that Roy had ",
      ", and it wasn\u2019t a hard case to make. But this season? His screen time is a fraction of what it was, and his charming, obscenity-laden crankiness has devolved into outright sadism. (See, again, the paint-rope and penis-strings.) And now this scene with Keeley?",
      "Was Brett Goldstein, who plays Roy, too busy with \u201cShrinking\u201d \u2014 he is one of the creators of the show, which is quite good \u2014 to occupy as central a role as he did last season? Were the other writers punishing him for his televisual two-timing? Whatever the explanation, \u201cTed Lasso\u201d is killing one of the best things it had going. No matter what the intended narrative payoff, happy or sad, it\u2019s hard to envision it making up for the way Roy\u2019s been portrayed for two-thirds of the season and counting.",
      "But back to Keeley and Jack. It turns out that the latter\u2019s \u201ctaking care of it\u201d is not quite as envisioned, when Keeley receives the abjectly apologetic note that she is expected to post to social media. Confronted about the statement, Jack demurs that her dad\u2019s lawyers drafted it. But her solution to the dilemma is simply another, different apology note for Keeley to put her name to.",
      "Keeley refuses. And after showing her hand probably more than she intended \u2014 \u201cthe person ",
      ", the person ",
      "\u201d \u2014 Jack shows herself the door with no promise she will return.",
      "I confess that this scene didn\u2019t really work for me in any direction: On the one hand, Jack seemed far too quick to make such an existential issue of the dispute, even for someone clearly accustomed to getting her way; on the other, Keeley seemed implausibly surprised that a lover or a boss \u2014 let alone someone who is both \u2014 would be unhappy about the public exposure of her partner/employee\u2019s sex tape.",
      "But this relationship has always seemed a bit forced, a way to give Keeley\u2019s P.R. firm story line the semblance of a plot without actually spending any time on her job itself. Keeley has been largely broken off from the story of Ted and the team with the premise of embarking on her own career. Yet instead of giving us any meaningful sense of that career, her season has consisted almost exclusively of Shandy drama followed by Jack drama, with regular scenes to discuss each with Rebecca.",
      "Indeed, there are times it\u2019s hard to believe \u2014 between traveling to Amsterdam with Rebecca, Aurora Borealising in Norway with Jack, and then taking the day off for mini-golf \u2014 that Keeley has a job at all. Likewise with Jack, who was initially introduced as something of a business titan but who seems more and more to be the daughter of a billionaire who dabbles in investing while reserving most of her energy for amusing herself.",
      "While I\u2019m on the subject: It\u2019s wonderful that \u201cTed Lasso\u201d has made such a clear effort to have substantive female characters in a show about a men\u2019s sports team. But it would be awfully nice if one of its two female multimillionaires had achieved her fortune through skill or perseverance rather than marrying or inheriting it from a man. (How much time, for that matter, has the show devoted to Rebecca\u2019s job? Awfully little since Season 1, when her \u201cjob\u201d was principally undermining Ted.)",
      "Last season, Keeley and Roy were the delightful hub around which much of \u201cTed Lasso\u201d revolved. This season, they\u2019ve both spiraled out into disappointing spots on the periphery of the show.",
      "Keeley\u2019s relationship with Jack is not the only potential casualty of the leaked sex videos, which Colin initially laughs off with a self-protective \u201cI guess I know what I\u2019ll be doing this weekend.\u201d But after Isaac commands the team to empty their cellphones of any signs of past sexual encounters, he sees Colin lagging behind and snatches his device. We don\u2019t see what Isaac sees, and obviously we don\u2019t have to. If we didn\u2019t know it already, Colin\u2019s crestfallen face speaks as loudly as any dialogue.",
      "What will Isaac do? I have no more idea than any of you. I expect there will be considerably more to say about this next week.",
      "There was no mention of Rebecca\u2019s charming Dutchman from ",
      ". Does this mean he really was just a one-night love affair to remind Rebecca she still had the ability to fall so happily? Or is he being held in reserve for a late-season surprise? Obviously, I\u2019d prefer (and honestly, anticipate) the latter. But I\u2019d ideally like it sooner than later, by which I mean immediately.",
      "So, Keeley sent a topless photo to one of her teachers when she was 15? Are we supposed to find that amusing?",
      "On a lighter note, here\u2019s to Jamie\u2019s extensive inventory of deodorant sprays.",
      "As with the ",
      " locker-room banter regarding \u201cShe\u2019s All That,\u201d \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and \u201cPygmalion,\u201d I thoroughly enjoyed Dani\u2019s reference to \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d followed by another player (left back Jeff Goodman?) concurring, \u201c[Expletive] yeah, ",
      "!\u201d",
      "Likewise, Rebecca\u2019s description, however unfounded, of the Eiffel Tower as a \u201clamppost with a publicist.\u201d",
      "I\u2019m not entirely sure what to make of Alyssa, Jack\u2019s college friend whom she and Keeley meet at mini-golf. Perhaps an ex?"

      "Gordon Lightfoot, the Canadian folk singer whose rich, plaintive baritone and gift for melodic songwriting made him one of the most popular recording artists of the 1970s, died on Monday night in Toronto. He was 84. ",
      "His death, at Sunnybrook Hospital, was confirmed by his publicist, Victoria Lord. She did not specify a cause, but Mr. Lightfoot had had a number of health problems in recent years.",
      "Mr. Lightfoot, a fast-rising star in Canada in the early 1960s, broke through to international success when his friends and fellow Canadians Ian and Sylvia Tyson recorded two of his songs, ",
      " and ",
      "When Peter, Paul and Mary came out with ",
      " of those songs \u2014 their \u201cFor Lovin\u2019 Me\u201d was a Top 40 hit \u2014 and Marty Robbins reached the top of the country charts with Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s ",
      " Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s reputation soared. Overnight, he joined the ranks of songwriters like Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs and Tom Paxton, all of whom influenced his style.",
      "Mr. Dylan in turn held Mr. Lightfoot in high regard. He once said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of any Gordon Lightfoot song I don\u2019t like,\u201d adding, \u201cEvery time I hear a song of his, it\u2019s like I wish it would last forever.\u201d Mr. Dylan included a version of \u201cEarly Morning Rain\u201d on his 1970 album \u201cSelf Portrait.\u201d (Among the other singers to have covered that song is Elvis Presley.)",
      "When folk music ebbed in popularity, overwhelmed by the British invasion, Mr. Lightfoot began writing ballads aimed at a broader audience. He scored one hit after another, beginning in 1970 with the heartfelt \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind,\u201d inspired by the breakup of his first marriage.",
      "That song \u2014 which begins with the memorable lines \u201cIf you could read my mind, love,/What a tale my thoughts could tell./Just like an old-time movie,/\u2019Bout a ghost from a wishing well\u201d \u2014 reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has been covered by Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Johnny Cash and numerous others.",
      "In quick succession he recorded the hits \u201c",
      "\u201d (his first and only No. 1 single), ",
      " (\u201cLet me slip away, slip away on you\u201d), ",
      " and ",
      " which he wrote after reading an article about the sinking of an iron-ore carrier in Lake Superior in 1975, with the loss of all 29 crew members.",
      "For Canadians, Mr. Lightfoot was a national hero, a homegrown star who stayed home even after achieving spectacular success in the United States and who catered to his Canadian fans with cross-country tours. His ballads on Canadian themes, like ",
      " pulsated with a love for the nation\u2019s rivers and forests, which he explored on ambitious canoe trips far into the hinterlands.",
      "His personal style, reticent and self-effacing \u2014 he avoided interviews and flinched when confronted with praise \u2014 also went down well. \u201cSometimes I wonder why I\u2019m being called an icon, because I really don\u2019t think of myself that way,\u201d Mr. Lightfoot told the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail in 2008. \u201cI\u2019m a professional musician, and I work with very professional people. It\u2019s how we get through life.\u201d",
      "Gordon Meredith Lightfoot Jr. was born on Nov. 17, 1938, in Orillia, Ontario, to Gordon and Jessie Vick (Trill) Lightfoot. His father managed a dry-cleaning plant. As a boy, he sang in a church choir, performed on local radio shows and shined in singing competitions. \u201cMan, I did the whole bit: oratorio work, Kiwanis contests, operettas, barbershop quartets,\u201d he told Time magazine in 1968.",
      "He played piano, drums and guitar as a teenager, and while still in high school wrote his first song, a topical number about the hula hoop craze with a catchy last line: \u201cI guess I\u2019m just a slob and I\u2019m gonna lose my job, \u2019cause I\u2019m hula-hula-hoopin\u2019 all the time.\u201d His attempts to sell it were unsuccessful.",
      "After studying composition and orchestration at the Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles, he returned to Canada. For a time he was a member of the Singing Swinging Eight, a singing and dancing troupe seen on the television show \u201cCountry Hoedown.\u201d But he soon became part of the Toronto folk scene, performing at the same coffee houses and clubs as Ian and Sylvia, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen.",
      "He formed a folk duo, the Two Tones, with a fellow \u201cHoedown\u201d performer, Terry Whelan. The duo recorded a live album in 1962, \u201cTwo Tones at the Village Corner.\u201d The next year, while traveling in Europe, he served as the host of \u201cThe Country and Western Show\u201d on BBC television.",
      "As a songwriter, Mr. Lightfoot had by then advanced beyond the hula hoop, but not by a great deal. His work \u201cdidn\u2019t have any kind of identity,\u201d he told Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, the authors of \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Folk, Country and Western Music,\u201d published in 1969. When the Greenwich Village folk boom brought Mr. Dylan and other dynamic songwriters to the fore, he said, \u201cI started to get a point of view, and that\u2019s when I started to improve.\u201d",
      "In 1965, he appeared at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island and at Town Hall in New York. \u201cMr. Lightfoot has a rich, warm voice and a dexterous guitar technique,\u201d Robert Shelton wrote in The New York Times. \u201cWith a little more attention to stage personality, he should become quite popular.\u201d",
      "A year later, after signing with Albert Grossman, the manager of Mr. Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary, Mr. Lightfoot recorded his first solo album, \u201cLightfoot!\u201d The album, which included ",
      " ",
      " ",
      " and ",
      " a hit in Canada in 1963, was warmly received by critics.",
      "Real commercial success came when he switched to Warner Bros., initially recording for the company\u2019s Reprise label. \u201cBy the time I changed over to Warner Bros., \u2019round about 1970, I was reinventing myself,\u201d he told the Georgia newspaper Savannah Connect in 2010. \u201cLet\u2019s say I was probably just advancing away from the folk era, and trying to find some direction whereby I might have some music that people would want to listen to.\u201d",
      "Accompanying himself on an acoustic 12-string guitar and singing in a voice that often trembled with emotion, Mr. Lightfoot gave spare, direct accounts of his material. He sang of loneliness, troubled relationships, the itch to roam and the majesty of the Canadian landscape. He was, as the Canadian writer Jack Batten put it, \u201cjournalist, poet, historian, humorist, short-story teller and folksy recollector of bygone days.\u201d",
      "His popularity as a recording artist began to wane in the 1980s, but he maintained a busy touring schedule. In 1999 Rhino Records released \u201cSongbook,\u201d a four-disc survey of his career.",
      "Mr. Lightfoot, who lived in Toronto, is survived by his wife, Kim Hasse, six children \u2014 Fred, Ingrid, Miles, Meredith, Eric and Galen \u2014 and several grandchildren. His first two marriages ended in divorce. His older sister, Beverley Eyers, died in 2017.",
      "In 2002, just before going onstage in Orillia, Mr. Lightfoot collapsed when an aneurysm in his abdominal aorta ruptured and left him near death. After he spent two years recovering, he recorded an album, \u201cHarmony,\u201d and in 2005 he resumed his live performances with what was billed as the Better Late Than Never Tour.",
      "He suffered a minor stroke in 2006 that temporarily affected his ability to play guitar, but he continued touring. Ten years later he performed 80 concerts and told The Canadian Press, \u201cAt this age, my challenge is doing the best show I can.\u201d But just last month, he announced that he was canceling all his scheduled concerts for health reasons.",
      "In an interview with the CBC in 2004, Mr. Lightfoot said he wanted to be like Willie Nelson and other veteran performers: \u201cJust do it for as long as humanly possible.\u201d",

      "There is not yet a series based on a slot machine \u2014 that I know of",
      "But Nandor is on to something: TV today is full of Things Based on Other Things. Films have become TV series (including \u201cShadows,\u201d an adaptation of a 2015 movie), as have books and superhero comics and podcasts and manga and video games.",
      "Nandor is on to something else too. \u201cFaithfulness\u201d has become a watchword for adaptations, sometimes a measure of authenticity, sometimes a billy club to police divergences from a favorite story.",
      "It\u2019s a term that raises a lot of unanswered questions: Faithful to what, or whom? Do fans of the original work have more of a claim on the adaptation than everyone else? Can you be faithful and creative at the same time \u2014 and do people asking for faithfulness even want that? Or do they simply want obedience?",
      "In its recent rebranding presentation, Max (the streaming service now known as HBO Max, which downsizes its name later this month) announced a slate of programming full of Things Based on Other Things. Along with a new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel adapted from novellas by George R.R. Martin, a series version of the horror movie \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d and a \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d spinoff (congrats, Nandor!), Max confirmed plans for a series repurposing one of Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s most valuable properties, the Harry Potter books.",
      "Much of the response focused, understandably, on the news that J.K. Rowling would produce the adaptation despite the controversy \u2014 even ",

      "\u201d But another curiosity in Max\u2019s attempt to squeeze more blood from the sorcerer\u2019s stone was its description of the series as \u201ca faithful adaptation.\u201d",
      "Faithful compared with what? The books have already been adapted into eight films, whose adherence to the plots was as tightly monitored as the prison at Azkaban. But with a limited run time and no access to Hermione Granger\u2019s time turner, they had to make cuts. A series, with a ",

      "More \u201cfaithful,\u201d here, means more exhaustive \u2014 more committed to reproducing, at a healthy budget, the images already inside the reader\u2019s head. And here\u2019s the problem with faith: The aesthetic version, like the religious one, can lead you to higher insight and inspiration, or it can shackle you to the unforgiving literal interpretation of a text.",
      "Adaptations are a devil\u2019s bargain. They are made for a reason, to gain the advantages of brand recognition and a pre-existing audience. But that comes with the burden of expectations: fans of the original checking it against the source, some looking for a fresh take, others looking for a completist video illustration.",

Or should you go in cold, to better represent the many viewers who will come to the material the same way? I\u2019ve done both, but you can never do both at the same time; once I had read the books that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is based on, I couldn\u2019t un-read them.",
      "But this is not your problem. The issue for viewers is that there are more and more series out there serving two audiences, the fans of the original work and the ones coming to the story new.",
      "Here, I\u2019m on the side of the newbies. Good TV can be challenging, but it should never be homework. If you need to have read or seen or heard a prior work to appreciate your show, you have made a bad show. The duties of reproduction (to realize something someone has already created) can be at odds with the duties of art (to create what never was).",
      "True creativity requires not blind faith but a little treachery. The best TV adaptations use the distinctly serial and visual medium to re-create the emotion and spirit of the source, whittling away whatever doesn\u2019t translate. HBO\u2019s \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d hews reasonably close to Elena Ferrante\u2019s plots, but it works as TV because it\u2019s artfully directed and miraculously cast, using image and the nuance of expression to convey the inner lives of its characters without drowning in exposition or voice-over.",

      ", \u201cthe script format inherently limits our access to the characters\u2019 innermost selves.\u201d",
      "Unfortunately, the adaptation by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (\u201c500 Days of Summer\u201d) fills in the gaps with mush. The series devotes a lot of energy to staging key performances and musical moments from the novel (which necessarily left much to the reader\u2019s imagination), but the fleshed-out personal dramas and artistic struggles pile on the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll period clich\u00e9s. The result may be a faithful-enough audio companion to the novel. As stand-alone TV, it plays like a ham-handed \u201cThis Is Us\u201d flashback.",
      "If \u201cDaisy Jones\u201d ends up a listless cover band, Prime Video\u2019s \u201cDead Ringers\u201d is a brilliantly reckless experiment. Its genetic material is the 1988 David Cronenberg body-horror movie (itself based loosely on a novel, which ",
      " echoed ",
      "), about the descent into madness of a pair of twin gynecologists, both played by Jeremy Irons.",
      "The six-episode series reimagines its twin leads, the idealistic obstetrician Beverly Mantle and the ambitious biomedical researcher Elliot Mantle, each so clearly delineated by Rachel Weisz you might forget there\u2019s only one of her.",
      "Gender-flipping the leads reframes the original film\u2019s ideas about the bloody machinery of childbirth \u2014 rooting the story in women\u2019s reality rather than abstract horror \u2014 but the series does so much more. It\u2019s a caustic, absurd comedy, a psychological drama of sibling dependence and a wry take on venture-capital medicine and privilege. (The sisters court an amoral opioid heiress, played by Jennifer Ehle.) Weisz and the writer Alice Birch have created a wondrous monster that firmly answers the questions too many adaptations fumble with: Why bother and why now?",

      " with Lizzy Caplan and Joshua Jackson as the principals in an affair that goes criminally wrong. It has good intentions in its update, with Caplan expanding on the problematic, bunny-boiling obsessive played by Glenn Close. But it ends up a tedious, mopey echo of upscale marital dramas like \u201cThe Affair\u201d (which Jackson also appeared in) while being too constrained by the parameters of the original story to go anywhere worthwhile.",
      "It\u2019s fitting, I guess, that a drama about infidelity should fall into the faithfulness trap. In the end, adaptation isn\u2019t a marriage. At best, it\u2019s an open relationship. Faithfulness is a great quality in real life, but when it comes to fiction, betrayal inevitably makes a better story."

      "Over the past few months, The New York Times has asked experts to answer the question, What would you play a friend to make them fall in love with jazz? We\u2019ve explored artists like ",
      " and ",
      ", and styles ranging from ",
      " to ",
      ".",
      "Now, we\u2019re turning to Herbie Hancock, the groundbreaking pianist and composer who emerged in jazz as something of a prodigy. At age 11, Hancock \u2014 who listened to classical music at the behest of his mother \u2014 played Mozart\u2019s D major Piano Concerto ",
      ". Three years later, he became interested in jazz after seeing a classmate play it on the piano. He eventually gigged around Chicago during summer breaks from college, which led to his working with the tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins in 1960. His career took off after the trumpeter Donald Byrd asked Hancock to play in his quintet. He moved to New York City and in 1962 released his debut album, \u201cTakin\u2019 Off,\u201d on Blue Note Records.",
      "That would have been a fine enough existence, but in 1963, his life changed when the trumpeter Miles Davis \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest jazz musician \u2014 brought Hancock into the fold to be a member of his band, the Second Great Quintet. Alongside Davis, the bassist Ron Carter, the drummer Tony Williams and the saxophonist Wayne Shorter, Hancock would become a superstar, lending his melodic chords to several cornerstone albums in Davis\u2019s discography. He left the band in 1968 and started tinkering with spacier sounds. By the early \u201970s, Hancock had all but abandoned jazz for funk and ambient textures, and released challenging music that didn\u2019t fit one box in particular. In 1973, he released his biggest album, \u201cHead Hunters,\u201d a propulsive funk odyssey that went platinum and led to Hancock playing to huge crowds.",
      "Now 60 years into his artistic trajectory, Hancock is still adventurous, still embracing new avenues and working with younger artists who are just as daring. Below, we asked 11 musicians, writers and critics to share their favorite Hancock songs. Enjoy listening to their choices, check out the playlist at the bottom of the article, and be sure to leave your own favorites in the comments.",
      "If I had to pick only one song to listen to for the rest of eternity, \u201cTextures\u201d would be it. It\u2019s not the flashiest or most technically/pianistically complicated performance, but it grooves in a way Herbie Hancock alone can. That is because it is Herbie Hancock alone! Herbie\u2019s 1980 LP \u201cMr. Hands\u201d always interested me because he took a fascinating approach to crafting it: Every track has a different and specific personnel of musicians. Each track feels like the musicians were handpicked to best represent each musical idea. But then you get to \u201cTextures,\u201d which only credits one musician \u2014 Herbie Hancock. From acoustic piano, to all sorts of keyboards and synthesizers to create bass lines and orchestrations, to programming the drums, every sound you hear was created by his own hands. This to me feels like the purest insight into the mind of a genius.",
      "The first time I heard \u201cActual Proof\u201d I was convinced it was made by time travelers, possibly from the year 2300. I had never heard anything like it. It has the hypnotic effect of being so freaky and funky and the groove so locked into warp speed. Yet it\u2019s deeply fluid and meditative at the same time. This track encapsulates everything I admire about Herbie\u2019s work: his forward thinking and explorative sound, his unique harmonic and melodic choices, his genius understanding of rhythm and the way he can converse with it in a song, his improvisation and flow, and his ability to make an absolute ripper of a tune that you can groove to with effortless joy. But behind the scenes, the music is incredibly challenging and innovative rhythmically and harmonically.",
      "Herbie\u2019s Rhodes solo on this is one of my favorite solos. It is so creative and expressive and playful and feels like a deep conversation with the other players. In general this recording embodies a time when a group of players were on some next level, listening to one another, exploring new sounds, pushing one another to stretch. It is a beautiful piece of history (even though I am still half convinced it is from the future).",
      "\u201cMaiden Voyage\u201d first crossed my path while I was in high school. It was an unexpected gift from my neighbor, a World War II Navy vet and landlord who would regale me with stories about the musicians he rented rooms to \u2014 Miles, Billie, ",
      ", Dizzy. All I could hear then, and still hear now, are its endless possibilities.",
      "The album was recorded in one day \u2014 March 17, 1965 \u2014 for Hancock\u2019s fifth studio release, after he enlisted Ron Carter, Tony Williams and the saxophonist George Coleman, along with the young trumpet titan Freddie Hubbard. Equal to his prowess and touch for the piano, Hancock is one of this music\u2019s greatest shape-shifters, as he has keenly adapted and created within the industry\u2019s ever-changing tides. Just as jazz was transitioning from individual-led to ensemble-driven, Hancock rendered several original compositions that any jazz group must cut its teeth on. And the title track to \u201cMaiden Voyage,\u201d from its palpable opening vamp to the unbridled freedom he builds, gives each player his respective moment to shine.",
      "\u201cHornets\u201d is musical archaeology. It is simultaneously resolute, absurd, deeply steeped in tradition yet stretching wildly into a future unknown. It asks questions about how we got here and where we are going. It\u2019s cinematic, standing outside an art opening but also a sweaty D.J. set. \u201cHornets\u201d is Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cTake the A Train\u201d for the Vietnam War era. It\u2019s as much a song for today as it was in 1973 (when it was released). \u201cHornets\u201d is the harbinger of \u201980s-era African Head Charge and \u201990s-era Wu-Tang Clan. It\u2019s a cellphone call on the subway with no headphones. \u201cHornets\u201d has always been a timeless classic that, like life, can be propulsive, confounding, intimidating and groovy. And just when you think you know what is happening, the kazoos come back in.",
      "The first time I heard Herbie Hancock\u2019s \u201c4 A.M.,\u201d I was with my friend Brandon Coleman. I remember we were driving. We went to ",
      ". We were very much into finding out where a lot of our favorite music came from, going in many different directions. We\u2019d pick up Jaco Pastorius\u2019s music, Weather Report, and all kinds of stuff. And Brandon really loved Herbie Hancock.",
      "I remember we heard \u201c4 A.M.\u201d in the car together and we both knew that we had to learn that song. At some point in the night, I remember we got back to his crib, and we tried to sit there and play through it a bit. I think we even tried to record it one time to see what it would be. And it was cool, man. We felt like it was such an amazing tune. It was the feeling of hearing it at the time, for both of us, that was very euphoric. To this day, it\u2019s still one of my favorite Herbie tunes.",
      "It\u2019s one of those moments that made us wonder, \u201cWow, these guys. Was this indicative of them being up at 4 a.m. and this is what happened with them?\u201d It even made me want to just stay up till 4 a.m. in life in general, just to see where things would take me.",
      "When asked recently about my favorite composition of Herbie Hancock, I actually found the question very difficult to answer. But \u201cSpeak Like a Child\u201d immediately caught my attention from the moment that I first heard it. I never forgot the feeling of that \u201cfirst listening.\u201d The mood and orchestration of the piece are beautiful. The recording is beautiful. But the special attraction for me, beyond these qualities, are Herbie\u2019s touch on the piano, his sound and the lyricism of his playing. This track offers images of innocence, clarity, imagination and mastery. Each player is listening.",
      "\u201cButterfly\u201d is a blend of beauty, funk and groove from Herbie Hancock\u2019s 1974 album \u201cThrust\u201d with his band the Headhunters. The notes start crawling toward your soul, tickling every intricate part like a caterpillar on your forearm. Great leaders know how to get the best out of people, and Herbie does just that while \u201changing\u201d in the cut until the 4:30 mark, where he starts to shed his \u201ccocoon\u201d and let his instrument become the star of the song. This is where you feel a transition happening, as the music takes on another life; wings are sprouting, colors floating, as you are sent to another stratosphere. By the 7:00 mark, you experience a beautiful \u201cButterfly\u201d that has taken off, with a flair and flutter that takes your breath away. By the 9:10 mark, you are reminded of the beautiful beginning, as Herbie always takes you on a magical, musical ride that you never want to get off of.",

      "Following a five-year stint in Miles Davis\u2019s Second Great Quintet (my favorite band of any genre ever), Herbie Hancock released \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d in 1969 as a partial tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was shot and killed the year before. In turn, the title track feels precarious, teetering between darkness and light. Against triumphant horns and a swinging backbeat played by the drummer Albert (Tootie) Heath, Hancock launches into it with murky electric piano chords, creating this alluring juxtaposition. On purpose, the song runs hot and cool, conveying attitudes of the oppressed and the oppressor, \u201c",

      " for real.",
      "At one point in his ",
      ", Hancock offers up an appealing idea: \u201cImprovisation \u2014 being truly in the moment \u2014 means exploring what you don\u2019t know.\u201d Realize that this comes from someone who loves nothing more than to figure out ",
      ". As a kid, Hancock was always deconstructing radios and toys, and he taught himself jazz by a similar method: dissecting what he heard on albums, down to the granule, and recreating it. (You\u2019ve seen ",
      ", right?) In tunes like \u201cDolphin Dance,\u201d a Hancock composition-turned-jazz standard, these two impulses \u2014 attention to detail, and affinity for mystery \u2014 don\u2019t feel at all opposed. There\u2019s a complex science to this piece, but plenty of open space for the spirit to come in, too. Hancock ",
      " an LP whose freely floating title track lingers on single chords for long passages, turning harmonies into environs. But \u201cDolphin Dance\u201d takes a different route toward no-resolution: The chords move around constantly, coloring the main melodic motif with different shades and feelings. Hear him play the tune alone, at a 1984 concert in Switzerland \u2014 pausing every so often to investigate and unravel a different chord, or refitting a woozy phrase into a swaggering groove \u2014 and you see what this is all about: The greater the detail, the more the mystery."

      "\u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\u201d his 1976 folk ballad, was unusual partly because, at more than six minutes long, it was about twice as long as most pop hits. It also retold a real-life tragedy \u2014 the 1975 sinking on Lake Superior of ",
      " \u2014 with meticulous attention to detail.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a documentarian\u2019s song, when you think about it,\u201d said Eric Greenberg, a longtime friend of the singer who interviewed Mr. Lightfoot as a student journalist in the late 1970s and later ",
      " with him.",
      "The plotline of a typical Top 40 hit usually consists of \u201cboy meets girl, boy breaks up with girl, or come back, or you left me, or whatever,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said, speaking by phone from New York City. \u201cNot a five-, six-, seven-minute story \u2014 a factual story, in Gordon\u2019s case, painstakingly checked to make sure that all the facts are right.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the true story that inspired \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\u201d and a look at the song that kept its memory alive.",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald was a 729-foot ore carrier and one of the largest freighters on the Great Lakes when it left Superior, Wis., on Nov. 9, 1975, carrying iron pellets bound for Detroit.",
      "The next day, the ship was caught in a storm with winds that averaged 60 to 65 miles an hour. Its captain reported 20- to 25-foot waves washing over the decks and water pouring in below deck through two broken air vents.",
      "That night, the Edmund Fitzgerald ",
      ", in water that was only about 50 degrees. A nearby ship reported seeing its lights disappear in the driving snow.",
      "The Coast Guard later found lifeboats, life rings and other debris from the ship. But the lifeboats were self-inflatable, so their discovery did not necessarily indicate that they had been used. None of the 29 crew members survived.",
      "The morning after the Fitzgerald went down, the rector of Mariners\u2019 Church of Detroit tolled its bell 29 times, once for each man lost. An Associated Press reporter knocked on the church\u2019s door, interviewed the rector and filed an account that was published in newspapers.",
      "Mr. Lightfoot read the article. Soon afterward, he started singing a song about the wreck during a previously scheduled recording session. His band joined in, and the first version of the song that they recorded was later released, according to ",
      " a 2020 documentary.",
      "There was no expectation that the song would become a hit single, because its length made it too long for airplay on the radio. But it would spend 21 weeks on the Billboard charts and ",
      ", one notch behind Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s only No. 1 hit, \u201cSundown.\u201d It also turned the tale of the sinking into a modern legend.",
      "Yet unlike songs that use a real-life story as the basis for embellishment, Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s ballad hewed precisely to the real-life details. The weight of the ore, for example \u2014 \u201c26,000 tons more than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty\u201d \u2014 was accurate. So was the number of times that the church bell chimed in Detroit.",
      "Decades later, Mr. Lightfoot ",
      " the lyrics slightly after investigations into the accident revealed that waves, not crew error, had led to the shipwreck. In the new lyrics, he sang that it got dark at 7 that November night on Lake Superior \u2014 not that a main hatchway caved in.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of meticulous, looking-for-the-truth kind of guy that he was,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said.",
      "\u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\u201d like its ",

      " (who also released an entire album of Lightfoot cover songs) and the rock bands Rheostatics and the Dandy Warhols were among those who",

      "Mr. Lightfoot remained proud of it for decades, and he kept newspaper clippings and items given to him by the crew members\u2019 surviving families in his home, Mr. Greenberg said.",
      "The song\u2019s success had one downside: It turned the wreck, which lies in Canadian territory at a depth of about 500 feet, ",

On Dylan\u2019s 1970 album \u201cSelf Portrait,\u201d he even recorded Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cEarly Morning Rain,\u201d and the respect was mutual \u2014 Lightfoot listened carefully to Dylan\u2019s songs, which instilled in him \u201ca more direct approach, getting away from the love songs,\u201d ",

      "In an expansive career that drew from Greenwich Village folk and Laurel Canyon pop, Gordon Meredith Lightfoot Jr., who ",
      ", was embraced by a diverse group of musicians: Elvis Presley and Duran Duran, Lou Rawls and the Replacements. He sang in a rueful baritone full of tenacity and an almost professorial air, and specialized in songs that dwelled on solitude, or recounted unhappy relationships, in grounded language that drew on folk and blues modes.",
      "\u201cLightfoot\u2019s is the voice of the romantic,\u201d Geoffrey Stokes of The Village Voice wrote in 1974. \u201cFor him (as for Don Quixote, one of his chosen heroes) perfection is always in view and always slipping from his grasp.\u201d",
      "Nowhere was Lightfoot more beloved than in his native Canada, where he helped transform its music industry into a worldwide force. \u201cHe sent a message to the world that we\u2019re not just a bunch of lumberjacks and hockey players up here,\u201d Geddy Lee of Rush said in \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind,\u201d a 2019 documentary. \u201cWe\u2019re capable of sensitivity and poetry.\u201d In the process, Lightfoot became one of the most successful recording artists of the 1970s.",
      "Here are 10 of Lightfoot\u2019s most beloved and impactful songs.",
      "The folk tradition in which Lightfoot initially worked is full of boastful songs about rambling men who are lighting out for the territory, but this one is uniquely cruel. It\u2019s pushed along by his stout acoustic guitar strumming and David Rea\u2019s sleek fingerpicking accents, which reinforce the lyric\u2019s hauteur. \u201cEverything you have is gone,\u201d Lightfoot tells the woman he\u2019s leaving. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for lovin\u2019 me.\u201d Her broken heart will eventually mend, he adds, at which point \u201cI just might pass this way again.\u201d He later felt some embarrassment about the song, and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what chauvinism was.\u201d",
      "Lightfoot grew up in bucolic Central Ontario, which could hardly be farther from Memphis, but he sounds nearly Southern on this simple, brisk folk song, which Presley recorded a few years later. Its theme is homesickness (Lightfoot was living in Los Angeles when he wrote it); the narrator, who\u2019s \u201cas cold and drunk as I can be,\u201d in addition to broke, watches a 707 fly overhead and envies its freedom as he pines for his hometown.",
      "In this canny depiction of wounded pride, Lightfoot gets together with an old friend to shoot the breeze, but amid the chitchat about sports and mutual acquaintances, he casually slips in a question that reveals his agenda: \u201cBy the way, did she mention my name?\u201d This song and \u201cFor Lovin\u2019 Me\u201d are fraternal twins, joined by their fascination with male pride.",
      "Lightfoot mostly worked the personal-relationship side of folk music and left the political side to others. The controversial \u201cBlack Day in July\u201d has a restless, unsettled drum track, and describes the July 1967 uprisings in Detroit in which Black residents protested police abuse, prompting the governor to send in the National Guard and the president to send in the army. The song is full of irony, scorn and bafflement (\u201cThe soul of Motor City is feared across the land\u201d) and most U.S. radio stations refused to play it.",
      "Lightfoot\u2019s commercial breakthrough (it reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100) is also his masterpiece, with assistance from Nick DeCaro\u2019s cascading string arrangement. The lyrics, inspired by his impending divorce, range from poetic to stark, until he reaches the stoic summary: \u201cStories always end.\u201d The melody inspired Duran Duran\u2019s \u201cSave a Prayer,\u201d and the song has been covered by a who\u2019s who of singers, including Barbra Streisand, Johnny Cash and Neil Young \u2014 and, almost, by Frank Sinatra, who tried to record it but gave up, declaring it \u201ctoo long.\u201d",
      "Lightfoot was an alcoholic who knew a lot about tempestuous relationships. He wrote \u201cSundown\u201d while in a jealous fit of fantasy about Cathy Smith, a girlfriend whose cheekbone he once broke during a fight. The lyrics are dark, and the snaking guitar solo is one of the great Red Shea\u2019s finest moments. The song\u2019s been covered by, among others, the goth legends ",
      " and ",
      ".",
      "The mid-70s was Lightfoot\u2019s commercial peak, but this successor to the Top 10 pop hits \u201cSundown\u201d and \u201cCarefree Highway\u201d didn\u2019t get the reception it deserved. The chords and lyrics call to mind Jimmy Webb, as Lightfoot, with his usual precise elocution, celebrates the way loyal friendships give succor to \u201chigh-stepping strutters who land in the gutters.\u201d",
      "His best-known song is one of the most unlikely pop hits: a six-and-a-half-minute folk ballad about a freighter that sank in Lake Superior a year earlier, killing 29 crew members. It\u2019s also surely the only Top 40 song to ever mention Gitche Gumee, the Chippewa name for Lake Superior. The impish rock band NRBQ sometimes played a ",
      ", and if the audience didn\u2019t like it, it would play it a second time as well.",
      "In some of Lightfoot\u2019s lyrics, it\u2019s difficult to tell whether the conflicts he describes are factual or merely byproducts of a suspicious imagination. In this softly scornful song about cheating, which he recorded in 1968 and rerecorded 10 years later, in a superior version, he believes his lover is using a friend\u2019s apartment to carry on an affair, and he implies that he\u2019ll eventually catch her: \u201cThe city where we live might be quite large/But the circle is small.\u201d",
      "In the 1980s, as music moved away from acoustic sounds, Lightfoot chased pop success by using synthesizers, drum machines and the producer David Foster, but he didn\u2019t sound like himself. By the time of \u201cHarmony,\u201d he\u2019d returned to working with the guitarists Shea and Terry Clements. Tobacco use had eaten away at the top of his range, but the title song of his penultimate studio album has a fragile, hard-won tenderness that seems to look back at his career (and his life) with peaceful regret."

      "No matter how you feel about King Charles III and Queen Camilla\u2019s recently revealed ",
      ", it seems unlikely to eclipse the most famous coronation dish of all \u2014 ",
      ".",
      "Created for the ",
      " of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, the posh, delicately flavored chicken has, like Britain itself, changed a bit since. What was originally an aristocratic paragon of classic French technique has been democratized into a weeknight-easy chicken salad. Though enormously popular in Britain as a sandwich filling and baked-potato topper, this ocher-tinted, raisin-studded dish would be unrecognizable to any of the 350 dignitaries who partook of its regal ancestor.",
      "The ",
      ", developed at the Cordon Bleu culinary school in London, was called \u201cpoulet Reine Elizabeth.\u201d A dish of cold poached chicken in a rose-hued sauce made from red wine, mayonnaise, whipped cream, apricot pur\u00e9e and a faint whiff of curry powder, it was served alongside a pea-studded rice salad at a coronation banquet to the queen\u2019s honored guests (but not likely to the queen herself).",
      ", a London-based food writer and author of \u201c",
      ",\u201d describes that dish as shaped by French cuisine with a nod toward colonial India, and based on the jubilee chicken created in 1935 for George V, who, like his grandmother Queen Victoria, had a penchant for curries.",
      "\u201cThe curry powder in coronation chicken was probably an acknowledgment of the influence of the empire and a tribute to the two previous curry-loving monarchs,\u201d Ms. Sukhadwala wrote in an email.",
      "Over the years, the recipe has become something more accessible to British home cooks. Out went the red wine reduction, whipped cream, homemade mayonnaise and apricot pur\u00e9e; in came jarred mayonnaise, golden raisins, sliced almonds and mango chutney, pantry staples you could quickly stir together in one bowl. And what was once a pinch of curry powder grew to several tablespoons, staining the mix a vivid \u2014 some say lurid \u2014 yellow.",
      "By the 1980s, coronation chicken salad had become ubiquitous in Britain, found in ready-made sandwiches at Marks & Spencer and on backyard party menus alike.",
      "This steep ascent was fueled by what the British food writer ",
      ", author of \u201c",
      ",\u201d calls a revival of Raj nostalgia that set in with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s tenure as prime minister.",
      "Coronation chicken \u201cwants to evoke the peacocks and rubies, the grandeur and spice of regal Indian dynasties, without actually delivering any strong flavors,\u201d Mr. Loyal said.",
      "Yet he\u2019s a fan. His version, which uses a complex Punjabi masala with black and green cardamom, ajwain, fennel and tamarind, alludes to the beloved 1980s version of his childhood while celebrating Mr. Loyal\u2019s identity as a second-generation British Indian.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m un-diluting its Indianness,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, the 1980s version is delightful, and a snap to make.",
      "The key is to choose your ingredients carefully. Start with cooked chicken that already has loads of flavor, whether you\u2019re poaching it yourself or buying a rotisserie bird from the store. Find a mango chutney brand that\u2019s complex and not too sweet. Use a good, tangy mayonnaise, ideally homemade. And \u2014 if you can find it \u2014 stir in curry paste from a jar instead of curry powder, which, depending on the brand, can have a raw, acrid undertone.",
      "The result is a dish for the people that\u2019s fit for a king. Which you might be hard-pressed to say about quiche."

      "At their groundbreaking restaurant ",
      ", Junghyun and Jeongeun Park seem to have the keys to a secret room filled with flavors that New York\u2019s older Korean restaurants barely hint at. Nearly every course on the elaborate tasting menus is made up of a dozen or more ingredients. There are stunning imported vinegars derived from mugwort, birch and cherry blossoms. Kimchi, often made on site, does not stop with cabbage and radishes but plunges into a realm of fermented tomatoes, chiles and mustard leaves.",
      "Some interesting items turn up on the plates at ",
      ", too, which the Parks \u2014 he goes by J.P. and she is called Ellia \u2014 have been operating in the Rockefeller Center concourse since October. You can, for instance, eat a sorbet flavored by the fleshy seed stalks of the Japanese raisin tree.",
      "But novelty is not the main point of this younger restaurant. While Atomix tries to expand our notions of what modern Korean cuisine might contain, Naro\u2019s executive chef, Nate Kuester, takes a different tack. His kitchen dives straight into traditional foods, starting with favorites like bibimbap and seafood jeon and reaching back to recipes that predate the 20th century, in ways that make them seem full of unexplored potential.",
      "Naengchae, a chilled salad usually presented with thin strips of vegetables fanned out on a plate, is a mainstay of Korean tables inside and outside the home. At Naro, the naengchae looks like a nest of vermicelli noodles when it shows up. The vermicelli turn out to be threads of kohlrabi, and they sit on top of lumps of king crab, slices of simmered octopus, wheels of watermelon radish and dabs of hot mustard, all meant to be stirred together. There\u2019s something else, too: flaky crystals of radish granita. This is an allusion to mul naengmyeon, cold noodles served in ice-cold, sometimes slushy brine that is used to pickle radishes. It\u2019s a magician\u2019s trick, this salad that turns into noodles that turn back into a salad again.",
      "Another illusion: the one-bite appetizer that looks at first like a piece of kimbap, soft tendrils of bracken fern wrapped in a belt of seaweed. When you eat it, though, you discover that the seaweed has somehow become as puffy and crunchy as a cracker \u2014 a version of gim bugak, the fried seaweed snack.",
      "Sanjeok, normally a straightforward skewer of grilled meats and vegetables, is also reimagined at Naro. Sweet soft bricks of butternut squash alternate with lengths of emulsified chicken sausage. It is surely the best chicken hot dog on a stick ever served in a Korean restaurant.",
      "Simpler dishes hold discoveries at Naro, too, like mixed mushrooms stir-fried with pickled burdock and mounded over a bowl of short-grain rice. The mushrooms are seasoned with sesame oil and seeds, and the rice is merely steamed, but very few things I\u2019ve eaten lately have tasted as rare and luxurious. And this is only a side dish. It showed up, with no warning from the menu, alongside a snowy block of halibut in a golden, aromatic broth made from the rice wine cheongju.",
      "You eat all this and more in a spare, incongruously futuristic dining room separated from the concourse by a curving Art Deco glass wall. Black chairs punctuate an expanse of white and off-white panels and banquettes, making the space look something like a set from \u201c",
      ".\u201d (It may be relevant that Naro-1 was the name of ",
      " to place a satellite in orbit around the earth.)",
      "A darker shade of paint on the ceiling and the sheer curtains that appeared on the glass wall in April have made the space look slightly less sci-fi. It is not the only change at Naro as the Parks try to adapt their vision of formal Korean dining to an underground mall full of office workers, tourists, commuters and skaters. The price of the tasting menus at dinner (one vegetarian and one not, each with about 11 courses) dropped to $165 from $195. Lunch, which had been a five-course, $95 tasting, now comes in a variety of sizes: two courses for $52, two courses and dessert for $68, and an \u00e0 la carte menu that runs from $19 to $46.",
      "The Parks have always been skilled at fitting their hospitality style to their interiors. At their first restaurant, ",
      ", which looks like an after-work canteen that might have been designed by ",
      " the hospitality strikes a gracious, casual tone. The precise but engaging spirit at Atomix sets the standard for tasting-counter service in the city.",
      "Naro aims for a blend of formality and friendliness, and servers are quick with a smile. They\u2019re quick all around, and not always in the right way. Early on, explanations of some dishes were so rushed I am still not quite sure what I ate, and the check was dropped at the same time as dessert; before I\u2019d picked up a spoon, somebody circled back for my credit card.",
      "The pace has slowed, but I still get the sense that Naro, like some of ",
      " in the concourse, is still trying to catch the rhythms of Rockefeller Center, where some people come just to look around and others are on their way to some other place.",
      "None of this seems to afflict Naro\u2019s kitchen, which has always been uncannily assured. The pastry chef, Celia Lee, who was last seen at ",
      ", puts together sweet meditations that could probably stand alone if the Parks decided to turn Naro into a dessert bar. Her sorbet of hallabong tangerines, a prized product of the island of Jeju, paired with fresh tangerine sections and a fluffy gin-scented cloud of Negroni over jellied Champagne, might even work at one of the city\u2019s more forward-thinking cocktail bars."

      "As spring bursts forth, wild turkeys begin the mating game. Groups congregate in lawns and fields \u2014 and sometimes in the middle of the street. Males puff out their iridescent feathers, fan their tails and drag their wings on the ground in a vie for the right to breed. Their faces and necks turn dazzling shades of blue and red.",
      "Once rare and elusive denizens of America\u2019s woodlands, these heaviest of the galliform birds (chickens and their relatives) have gone urban. Wild turkeys live in the residential neighborhoods around my home in Madison, Wis.",
      "A few years ago, their elaborate courtship displays fascinated me so much that I began to photograph them \u2014 and, as I\u2019ve learned, there\u2019s more happening than meets the eye.",
      "For starters, turkeys of a feather flock together. Males, known as toms, can form lifelong flocks with their brothers. Dr. Alan Krakauer, a ",
      " and fellow ",
      ", studied this as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He ",
      " that toms in a flock were anywhere from full to half-siblings. These bands of brothers cooperated to court females, or hens, and chase off competing males.",
      "Remarkably, though, only the dominant male mated and fathered offspring. The subordinate brothers served as \u201cwingmen,\u201d \u201cbodyguards,\u201d or \u201cbackup dancers,\u201d to use Dr. Krakauer\u2019s colorful descriptions. \u201cThey have what I think of as a support role,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite the potential for lifelong celibacy, wingmen benefited from the arrangement, Dr. Krakauer found \u2014 at least by the raw calculus of evolution. On average, dominant males with wingmen produced seven offspring a season, whereas solo males produced fewer than one. Since the males were closely related, those seven offspring contained more of the wingmen\u2019s genes than if they\u2019d sired a single chick themselves.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re helping their brother get a lot more females than either of them would get on their own, so this cooperation seemed particularly helpful,\u201d explained Dr. Krakauer. \u201cThat seemed to be surprising for people at the time.\u201d",
      "Anyone who\u2019s had a brother knows the vicissitudes of fraternal relations. While brothers generally cooperate during the mating season, intense fighting breaks out at other times, as they jostle for rank. Turkeys have formidable weapons: large bodies, powerful wings and spurred feet. On one occasion, I saw a fight so violent that spittle flew \u2014 like when a boxer is hit by a knockout punch.",
      "While males are aggressive with each other, they aren\u2019t aggressive toward females and do not force copulations, despite being twice the size of their mating partners. So while males may strut with abandon, females ultimately choose their mates. They\u2019re picky about partners and know what they want: males with long snoods.",
      "Snoods are the fingerlike fleshy protuberances that flop over a turkey\u2019s beak. The animals can contract and relax muscles and blood vessels in their head and neck, causing changes in the organ\u2019s length and color. A tom sporting a long red snood draws the attention of hens like flies to honey \u2014 although, to their credit, the hens manage to be coy about it.",
      "Dr. Richard Buchholz, ",
      " at the University of Mississippi, has spent his career studying wild turkeys. He examined the role that various male ornaments \u2014 including snoods, caruncles (pebble-like bumps on the head and neck), skullcaps (thickened skin on top of the head), spurs (talons on the legs) and beards (tufts of hairlike feathers projecting from the chest) \u2014 play in female mate choice. He ",
      " that snood length was the primary factor that explained which male a female chose as a mate. Even a few extra millimeters made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt did surprise me, especially since the snood doesn\u2019t seem to be a very functional thing to choose,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. \u201cWhy the snood and not all the other ornaments on males?\u201d",
      "The answer lies in a phenomenon with deep roots in biology: Fancy accouterments may indicate good genes. For turkeys, a male who can afford to sport a killer snood must have had ample resources, which ostensibly reflects the quality of his DNA. Dr. Buchholz found that males with longer snoods had fewer coccidia parasites, which don\u2019t harm adults but can sicken or kill chicks, and ",
      " that may make them resistant to coccidia.",
      "\u201cEarly on there\u2019s probably a big impact on chick survival,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said, so by choosing longer-snooded males, females may provide their babies with lifesaving parasite resistance.",
      "Dr. Buchholz is still uncertain about the role some other male ornaments play. Like snoods, other fleshy structures on a turkey\u2019s face and neck can change color during displays. For example, males will drain all the blood from the caruncles so they\u2019re as white as a sheet of paper, Dr. Buchholz said. He remains unsure of what the change in the caruncles might signal, or why it\u2019s important.",
      "And what about those fancy feathers? \u201cI don\u2019t know if females care,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. The feathers of male turkeys infected with coccidia ",
      ", which turkeys (but not we humans) can see. However, no one has studied whether females scoff at dull feathers the way they do at puny snoods.",
      "There\u2019s still a lot to learn about wild turkey mating behavior. \u201cFor a bird that\u2019s such a great conservation success story, that\u2019s so common and interesting to people, and that has a cultural connection to the American Thanksgiving, for us to not know more about its behavior is really a shame,\u201d said Dr. Buchholz.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s not entirely surprising. Wild turkey populations are currently ",
      " in many parts of the country, thanks to conservation efforts; in places like New England, Madison and Berkeley, they\u2019re now so common that they get about as much notice from passing motorists as a traffic cone.",
      "But that wasn\u2019t always the case. Until recently, wild turkeys were rare in the United States \u2014 \u201cwhich seems crazy now,\u201d Dr. Krakauer said, \u201csince they\u2019re right in town and blocking traffic.\u201d"

      "At times they look like superheroes, moving together to the rhythm of the music, conjuring tricks like magicians.",
      "I first heard of the Sea Clown Sailing Circus when I was following the stories of refugees crossing Greece. Members of the circus were performing at a camp in Athens, trying to win smiles from children who had experienced too much pain.",
      "Later, I joined the performers in the summer of 2020 on the storied island of Ithaca, in the Ionian Sea. Hoping to sail with the nomad crew, I happened to arrive the very day their engine broke down. Apparently it was a regular occurrence. A technician from the island mocked them: The engines were rusting from lack of use, he said.",
      "It was true that Fred Normal and Alvaro Ramirez, the captains, never wanted to use the engines, aiming instead to sail with the wind as much as possible \u2014 even while docking at and departing from the port.",
      "Twenty years earlier, in the United States, Fred, an Alaska-born circus performer, decided it was pointless to try to change the world while traveling with gas-guzzling trucks and caravans. Instead, he resolved to offer his form of utopia to people across the United States and Europe by bicycle. He rode around with his crew from one town to the next, staging pop-up shows and sleeping beside campfires.",
      "Eventually, on the Southern coast of Italy, he met Nikoleta Giakumeli, a Greek acrobat, and Alvaro, a Uruguayan clown who had been traveling around Europe. Together, the trio dreamed up the idea of a seaborne circus, even though none of them had ever formally sailed.",
      "So they learned. For 13 years, Fred and Nikoleta lived on their boat, Surloulou, through summers and winters. After the birth of their daughter, Sirena, who at the age of 4 is already climbing ropes and trying her first tricks as an acrobat, their lives changed dramatically. They now spend less time with the circus, which, despite their absence, continues reinventing itself with new performers and new ideas.",
      "Dozens of artists from all over the world are connected with the Sea Clown Sailing Circus. Some join the crew for only a few days; others join for the whole summer. But a core group of around seven or eight people are trying to bring the circus to a greater acclaim \u2014 not only by roaming freely from one Greek island to another, but also by producing more meaningful, and more philosophically engaging, shows.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when I joined the Sea Clowns again for a month, they were producing a new show based on Plato\u2019s ",
      ". I saw firsthand how dedicated the performers are to their craft. Though their performances often feel impromptu, the Sea Clowns are in fact immensely disciplined in their preparations. Every act \u2014 from acrobatic shows and fire juggling to aerial rope tricks and slacklining \u2014 requires a tremendous degree of skill and training. And they simply love to learn.",
      "Being a part of the crew requires being good at sailing, music or circus acts, and ideally all three. But what\u2019s most important is the ability to express enough humor, kindness and respect to live in proximity with a crew of curious artists every day without creating tensions.",
      "It\u2019s also a challenge, of course, to adapt to life on a shoestring budget. \u201cWe live or we die by the hat,\u201d Fred would say at the end of every show, inviting the public to offer a donation for the Sea Clowns\u2019 survival.",
      "The life of a street (or water) artist is fragile, delicate \u2014 like a tightrope act, or juggling with knives, or sailing through a storm. Yet for most of the crew, nothing seems to offer them a greater sense of freedom. The Sea Clowns ride with their sails open to the wind, confronting both their dreams and an unpredictable future.",
      "\u201cOur work aims to show that nothing is impossible,\u201d Alvaro said, \u201cunless your mind convinces you to believe the opposite.\u201d"

      "Ten-year-old Harbor Eaton lives with her family on ",
      " on Maine\u2019s Schoodic Peninsula. The Eaton family primarily grows produce crops, but balsam-harvesting and wreath-making is a way of extending the farm\u2019s production into the colder, darker seasons. In November and December, Harbor goes out tipping with her family and farm workers on adjacent woodlots, with the aid of their horses, Andy and Starr.",
      "\u201cYou go out into the woods, try to find a tree with good foliage. You take a branch, snap it and make sure it doesn\u2019t have brown spots on it \u2014 \u2019cause you don\u2019t want a brown wreath,\u201d Harbor explained.",
      "Cedar, Harbor\u2019s 7-year-old brother, said that the trick is to use a stick that\u2019s sharpened on one end \u2014 with four branch stubs sticking out \u2014 to stack and collect the boughs into a portable unit.",
      "\u201cDo that over and over till you have filled the stick with branches,\u201d Cedar said. \u201cThen you put the stick on the wagon. You do it all over again until the horses pull us home with all the full sticks.\u201d",
      "Balsam-harvesting is a welcome change of pace for farmers at the end of the season\u2019s crescendo. \u201cAfter spending the majority of our time focusing our energy on the soil and working looking down, we get into the woods and just stare at the trees, looking up toward the sky,\u201d said Liz Moran, who manages Darthia Farm and raises Harbor and Cedar with her partner, Steve Eaton, known as Shepsi.",
      "The process of tipping is hard work: the physical picking and pulling, the weight of the heavy branches. Tippers also need to keep an ear out for hunters in the forests, and pull off ticks at day\u2019s end. But Ms. Moran describes a certain magic about the work: bringing warm treats to eat, noticing the soft patterns in the branches, letting the children play as they work, listening for the barred owl that lives near the entrance of the woodlot. The crew sometimes sing while they work, their voices echoing off the trees.",
      "\u201cThe woods offer such a different acoustic environment than the open gardens and fields,\u201d Mr. Eaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to hear each other in the woods if we are singing.\u201d",
      "In Maine, especially in the state\u2019s Downeast region, generations of people have built lives on seasonal, nature-based work: digging clams, pulling traps on commercial fishing boats, raking blueberries, processing seafood and crops. Harvesting balsam and making wreaths play important roles in this cycle.",
      "Geri Valentine started making wreaths in the 1970s, and it\u2019s still a part of her patchwork of seasonal jobs. As she wire-wrapped handfuls of evergreen around metal rings in a cozy cabin on Darthia Farm, she recalled her early days as a wreather. \u201cBack then, it was mostly a cottage industry \u2014 people would go out in family groups to gather brush,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople like clam diggers and fishermen would go out brushing after the fishing season was over, and it was a way to bring in some income, especially right before Christmas, heading into the lean months.\u201d",
      "Ms. Valentine has chosen a simple life. She lives in a cabin in the town of Addison without electricity and running water; she grows her own food with friends; she drives a used car. \u201cI don\u2019t want very much,\u201d she said. \u201cI change my jobs with the seasons.\u201d",
      "\u201cLiving this way feels very grounded,\u201d she continued. These days, though, people can\u2019t survive as easily on seasonal work, she said. \u201cIf you have a truck payment, if you\u2019ve got a mortgage, if you want to send your kids to college, you can\u2019t swing a life of digging clams in the summer and making wreaths for Christmastime.\u201d",
      "When you talk to locals, they agree: The systems have changed. The bigger wreath manufacturers, including Kelco Industries, Worcester Wreath Co. and Whitney Wreath, likely made the ones you find at your local grocery store or in catalogs. By some estimates, such companies employ about 2,000 migrant workers to harvest materials and work in wreath factories in Downeast Maine \u2014 often the same workers who harvested wild blueberries in summer and who returned to Maine for wreath season.",
      "Among the migrant workers, there have been growing concerns about low wages, substandard housing, exploitative work conditions and a lack of access to health care and education. Nonprofits like ",
      " and the ",
      " provide support to seasonal workers, including those employed by the wreath industry.",
      "This year, local nonprofits collaborated with farmers to gather warm clothes, blankets and supplies for wreath workers who are often unprepared for the cold of New England in November and December. Mounds of donated goods piled up at drop-off sites \u2014 enough that Bo Dennis, a flower farmer and organizer, borrowed a clean cattle trailer to carry it all to Mano en Mano\u2019s office in Milbridge.",
      "Mr. Dennis grows flowers at his farm, ",
      ", in Monroe, Maine, and is also on staff at ",
      ", where he works on programs for beginner farmers. He offers his farmland for other queer farmers to find an entry point to agriculture and rural life. He\u2019s tuned in to the networks of people and plants around him and the ways they may need support \u2014 and this mind-set extends to the forests.",
      "\u201cWhen we harvest, we are pruning a tree,\u201d Mr. Dennis said, explaining that tippers only cut the last 12 to 15 inches of a tree branch \u2014 a sustainable practice. He loaded heavy bags of boughs into his truck, all harvested from a friend\u2019s woodlot, a chunk of clear-cut land that had grown in with thick, scrubby trees.",
      "Mr. Dennis mainly harvests balsam fir, supplemented with cedar, pine and juniper. He is careful about where he harvests, and on whose land. \u201cAs a trans person, I\u2019m hyper-aware that I want to have consent with anything I\u2019m doing, including having consent to the land,\u201d he said.",
      "By percentage, Maine is the most forested state in America; about ",

I see it over and over: tippers cupping their palms to their face and pulling pine needles from their hair. The smell is earthy and nostalgic. The wreaths will smell this way, too: joyful circles on front doors across the country, formed by the work of strangers, and made from trees that continue to grow."

      "A lot has changed in the monarchy, and in the monarch, since the early days of the queen\u2019s reign. Elizabeth came to the top job through accidents of history and fate. Her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936, disrupting the normal order of succession; her father, George VI, succeeded him but died 16 years later at the age of 56, propelling Elizabeth onto the throne. By contrast, Charles \u2014 the oldest Prince of Wales in British history to become king \u2014 was born a monarch-in-waiting and has had a lifetime to prepare.",
      "The public in turn has had a lifetime to get to know Charles, starting from his rarefied childhood in the public eye. We had a ringside seat at his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in 1997; we followed his affair with and eventual marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles; we saw his struggles with his second son, Prince Harry, in an ongoing saga that is bound to spill over into the coronation, which Harry is scheduled to attend without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "By tradition, heirs to the throne don\u2019t meddle in unroyal matters. But Charles was an unusually outspoken Prince of Wales. He is known as a lover of classical music, a student of philosophy and world religions and a proponent of sometimes controversial ideas. He has often waded into debates on unexpected topics like alternative medicine and organic farming (pro) and modernist architecture (against).",
      "In London alone, there are plenty of royal spots to visit (Kensington Palace and Westminster Abbey, for starters), royal-themed exhibits to explore (",
      " at Madame Tussauds) and coronation-themed walking tours through this most inviting of cities.",
      "But for visitors interested in exploring the history and psyche of the new king, here are some stops on an alternative royal tour in and around the city.",
      "Charles bought Highgrove House, a Georgian neo-Classical estate in Gloucestershire, in 1980, before he married Diana. He saw it as a refuge, a bolt-hole in which he could pursue country pleasures and contemplate the beauty of nature; she found it boring and preferred the city. More and more, it became the place where he arranged discreet trysts with Camilla Parker Bowles.",

      " each April through October. Until the end of May, there\u2019s also an exhibition at the Garrison Chapel in Chelsea, London, ",
      ",\u201d that lets you appreciate the gardens without leaving the city.",
      "The exhibition demonstrates how fully the gardens embody Charles\u2019s philosophical and aesthetic preoccupations: his love of nature, his passion for tradition, his enthusiasm for artisanal crafts. There\u2019s a winsome photo of him on his knees weeding, and several never-before-seen princely watercolors and sketches.

As Charles once said: \u201cI never underestimate the value of the \u2018golden hoof\u2019 in the great scheme of biodiversity.\u201d",
      "When Charles was still an unhappy student in a remote Scottish boarding school, a high-level committee decreed that, in a break with tradition, he should continue his education instead of going directly into the military. Thus he became the first Prince of Wales ever to receive a university degree.",
      "The young prince was sent to Trinity, the richest of Cambridge University\u2019s 31 colleges. His life there was hardly normal. Isolated by temperament and position from most of the other students, Charles frequently repaired to the countryside for shooting weekends and to London for cultural and state functions.

      "\u201cHow many times does it happen in one\u2019s lifetime that you get to see a coronation?\u201d said Ms. Higgins Horwitz, 58, who will travel from her home in Skokie, Ill., next week for an organized tour that covers palaces, castles and towers linked to the royal family. \u201cIt\u2019s history in the making.\u201d",
      "Flags and royal emblems are already adorning the streets of London as it prepares to celebrate Britain\u2019s first coronation in 70 years with great pomp and spectacle.",
      "The three-day affair will include a royal procession through central London, a celebrity-studded concert at Windsor Castle, and a national holiday on May 8, as well as street parties across the country.",
      "Areas around Buckingham Palace and the central route known as the Mall are already \u201ccrammed with people,\u201d said Patricia Yates, the chief executive of VisitBritain, the national tourism agency. \u201cThere\u2019s a real interest,\u201d she added.",
      "U.S. travelers \u2014 Britain\u2019s biggest inbound market \u2014 are expected to lead next week\u2019s swell of arrivals. Flight bookings from the United States to Britain are about 10 percent higher in May compared with May 2019, before the pandemic, according to VisitBritain. According to Hopper, the booking app, they are also more expensive \u2014 round-trip airfares from the United States to London over coronation weekend averaged $733 in mid-April, 21 percent higher than a year earlier.",
      "After the coronation dates were announced, searches for Airbnb rentals in London during the coronation weekend ",
      ", according to the company, which reported U.S. travelers among the top guests in London around the coronation dates, along with travelers from Britain, France, Australia and Germany (the company declined to share booking numbers).",
      "By late March, hotel bookings in London on the booking platform Expedia were 60 percent higher for the coronation weekend compared with the same time last year. By mid-April, rooms were averaging about $350 per night, according to Hopper.",
      "Lana Bennett, the chief executive of Tours International, a British company that runs special interest tours, said U.S. visitors showed high interest in their six-night ",
      ", which Ms. Higgins Horwitz is joining and was sold out by February. \u201cIt shines a light on the country, and it gives people an opportunity to come.\u201d",
      "But not all travelers headed to London over coronation weekend are thrilled.",
      "Laura Aveidi, a youth fitness instructor living in Houston, was disappointed to find out that her family vacation to London, which she booked last July, coincided with the festivities. \u201cThe city is going to be packed and it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d Ms. Aveidi said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t interest us.\u201d",
      "Despite booking early, two separate Airbnb hosts canceled Ms. Aveidi\u2019s reservations in central London, leaving her scrambling. She paid almost double her budget for a third Airbnb at the last minute. Though the company reimbursed her for some of her unexpected costs, Ms. Aveidi said planning the trip was a nightmare. \u201cOne hundred percent we would have changed the dates,\u201d she said. (On coronation day, she and her family are taking a day trip to Liverpool to watch a soccer game instead.)",
      "Even some royal fans who attended the Platinum Jubilee are staying home, in what may be a reflection of Charles historically being ",
      " than his mother, Queen Elizabeth. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have the interest this year,\u201d said Ralph Iantosca, a Texas-based ",
      ", who only has one client visiting London that weekend. \u201cThe ones that did have the interest don\u2019t want crowds.\u201d",
      "For people making a longer journey to attend the coronation, the event is not only a celebration of Charles\u2019s coronation, but a way of connecting to their heritage.",
      "Paul Dabrowa, a biotech company founder who lives in Melbourne, Australia, said that being in London for the coronation is a way for him to honor his own family history. Mr. Dabrowa said his family members were displaced from Poland during World War II and resettled by British law in Australia after the war.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of respect for the monarchy,\u201d he said, adding that he had also attended Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral last September. He has not yet made up his mind about her son, Charles, but will be watching the royal procession on May 6 in central London. \u201cIt\u2019s worth giving him a chance and seeing what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Pranay Manocha, a London-based software engineer, will not be with the crowds cheering.",
      "Mr. Manocha, 43, said that the fanfare is poorly timed, considering the rising cost of living in Britain, which has left many people struggling to afford their grocery bills. Additionally, his grandparents were displaced by the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, a legacy of colonialism: Celebrating an institution that had left lasting pain did not seem right, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be insufferable, almost, to see everybody celebrating the very thing that still hurts,\u201d he said, adding that he would be going hiking in Cornwall on May 6 instead. \u201cI hope that the weather will be nice.\u201d"

      "Not long into the pandemic, Americans were eager to tip their front-line-working baristas and servers. But now that tip fatigue has set in \u2014 driven by the proliferation of ",
      " that suggest tipping for everything from a sandwich at a grab-and-go counter to an ultrasound \u2014 consumers are often bewildered by when and how much to tip.",
      "\u201cThis is the hottest topic in etiquette right now,\u201d said Daniel Post Senning, the co-author of \u201cEmily Post Etiquette, The Centennial Edition\u201d and the great-great grandson of the etiquette icon ",
      ". He cites the pressure of inflation, the disruption of the pandemic and the rush back to travel for the unease. \u201cThere\u2019s growing anxiety and public discussion around tipping.\u201d",
      "Offering guidance on when and how much to tip when you travel, etiquette experts, academics and travelers weighed in with the following advice.",
      "Tipping standards at restaurants vary widely around the world. In the United States, the American Hotel & Lodging Association suggests in its \u201cGratuity Guide\u201d leaving 15 percent of the total bill or up to 20 percent for extraordinary service.",
      "\u201cThe minimum is 15 percent,\u201d said Elaine Swann, an etiquette expert and the founder of the ",
      " in Carlsbad, Calif. \u201cIt can be increased from there based on the level of service received.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, tip averages in restaurants nationally had crept up to 18 percent, a standard that fell back to 15 percent more recently as inflation grew, according to Amanda Belarmino, an assistant professor in the hospitality school at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cI don\u2019t think consumers want to be stingy, but everybody\u2019s budget is tight and they\u2019re trying to make trade-off decisions,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite expert advice, consumers may not have a choice. In many American cities, tips are increasingly included in the bill and often are well above 15 percent. A recent ",
      " making the rounds in New York argues for a 20 to 25 percent standard.",
      "At a trendy cocktail bar in Los Angeles recently, an $18 drink came to $24 after an 18 percent gratuity and an additional fee for employee health care. The bartender mentioned that the establishment includes tips in their tallies because it serves many guests from foreign countries where tipping is not standard.",
      "According to the ",
      ", service charges benefit all employees, including cooks and dishwashers as well as waiters. \u201cThe service charge model ensures that employee compensation is fair, reliable and not reliant on the diners\u2019 experience or bias,\u201d said Erika Polmar, the executive director of the coalition.",
      "Beyond the United States, tip amounts vary, as illustrated in ",
      " Often, they are less than in the United States and are sometimes included as a service charge (see the section below on tipping abroad).",
      "Some tip requests should be denied, according to experts.",
      "For example, when you\u2019re ordering coffee or a sandwich from a kiosk or counter and are presented with a payment screen including suggested tip amounts, \u201cPush past that awkwardness and push no tip,\u201d Ms. Swann said. \u201cProprietors are offering a perk to employees and they\u2019re putting it on the backs of consumers to absorb.\u201d",
      "Caving in to social pressure or even a scowl from the employee is, in Ms. Swann\u2019s opinion, \u201cgiving in to a level of entitlement that should be nonexistent.\u201d",
      "The growth of credit card payments over cash has made it harder to show a token of appreciation via the tip jar, especially if you\u2019re not carrying cash. If in the past you would pay with cash and leave the coins, Mr. Senning advised rounding up on your credit card and doing the same thing virtually.",
      "Beyond restaurants, travel offers many other opportunities to leave tips for service providers such as cabdrivers, bellhops and valets. Before she takes a trip, Ms. Swann goes to the bank to get cash, especially the $1 and $5 bills that are nearly impossible to withdraw from A.T.M.s.",
      "Most experts agree taxi or rideshare drivers deserve 15 to 20 percent of the fare, depending on the service and the cleanliness of the vehicle. (Ms. Swann once rode in a rideshare car filled with dog hair and made the rare decision not to tip.)",
      "Airport skycaps and the bell people at a hotel should get a few dollars a bag, based on service, and perhaps more if the task is onerous, like handling golf or ski bags. Valet parkers should get $2 to $5 at drop-off and pickup.",
      "And if you only have larger bills, Ms. Swann added, it\u2019s perfectly fine to ask for change back.",
      "Etiquette experts say hotel guests should leave $2 to $5 a night for the housekeeper each morning. The American Hotel & Lodging Association recommends $1 to $5 a night left daily, preferably in a marked envelope making it clear that it is intended for the housekeeper. In its ",
      ", UNITE HERE, the labor union whose members include hotel workers, suggests a minimum of $5 a day and more for suites.",
      "Not many travelers comply.",
      "Despite having the most physically demanding jobs in hotels with few avenues for advancement, \u201chotel housekeepers are some of the least-often tipped employees in the service industry,\u201d according to Dr. Belarmino of U.N.L.V. \u201cUnlike servers, who are often paid less than minimum wage that is then made up by tips, hotel housekeepers\u2019 pay is not contingent upon tips. However, it is a courtesy to tip them.\u201d",
      "But in the age of ",
      " or optional room cleaning, which has become more common since the pandemic, the guidelines get murkier. \u201cIf you stay one night or if you choose to skip housekeeping, I would recommend tipping about $5 at checkout,\u201d Dr. Belarmino said.",
      "If housekeeping is available on demand, most experts recommend tipping each time the room is serviced. And you may want to consider raising the amount.",
      "\u201cIf the hotel won\u2019t do daily housekeeping, make sure to tip extra on the days that you do get service and at checkout, because rooms that have gone days without housekeeping are dirtier and harder for housekeepers to clean,\u201d wrote D. Taylor, the international president of UNITE HERE, in an email.",
      "Customs regarding gratuities vary by country. On some trips abroad, guides with the high-end tour company ",
      " use orientation sessions to advise guests on when to tip in unexpected places \u2014 like bathrooms in Egypt \u2014 and provide travelers with small denominations in the local currency to do so.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a guide to instruct you, make learning the culture of tipping abroad part of your trip planning by consulting guidebooks, tourism board websites and online sources like ",
      ".",
      "\u201cYou have to look at two things: Is it expected and mandatory as it is here in the U.S. for many service jobs? And what is the social safety net like in that place?\u201d said Pauline Frommer, the editorial director of ",
      ", which publishes travel guidebooks covering 48 countries, including advice on how to tip.",
      "In countries like Mexico, where wages are low, she advised tipping in restaurants as you might at home. In Europe, where waiters are paid better, tipping is less important. On trips to London and Paris last summer, she found bills with service fees included, often listed as \u201cS.C.\u201d for \u201cservice charge.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know, you might tip on top of that,\u201d she said, recommending that travelers scrutinize their bills and ask if something is unfamiliar.",
      "In Italy, travelers might find a nominal charge called a \u201ccoperto\u201d on their bill covering bread and water.",
      "\u201cIt comes from the days when you would go to an inn and if you wanted to have a tablecloth and plates, they charged you for it,\u201d said Pam Mercer, the owner of California-based ",
      ", which specializes in small-group travel in Italy and France.",
      "When it comes to restaurant meals in those countries, \u201cThere\u2019s not a hard and fast rule,\u201d Ms. Mercer said. Her company advises guests to tip 5 to 10 percent at restaurants and give the tip directly to the waiter.",
      "In cafes and cabs, she rounds up and leaves the change.",
      "\u201cFrance pays its employees a living wage, unlike the U.S.,\u201d wrote Janice Wang, an American living in France who runs a Facebook group for expatriates there, in an email. \u201cHence, servers, hairdressers and cabdrivers don\u2019t need tips to live. They appreciate them, but don\u2019t need them. And they never expect a tip.\u201d",
      "Guide services come in many varieties \u2014 from a walking tour leader to a mountaineer who helps you navigate a rock face. Travelers might engage their services for a half-day trip, a two-week tour, and everything in between and beyond.",
      "The global tour company ",
      " states on its website that \u201ctipping is never compulsory, but always appreciated,\u201d while also making the point that tips are a big part of a guide\u2019s income, especially in the United States and Southeast Asia. On a multiday small-group trip in the United States, the company suggests tipping $7 to $10 a day.",
      "The tour company ",
      " notes that 10 to 20 percent of the trip cost for its wilderness outings is standard where it operates in Seward, Alaska. The tip for a group ",
      " led by a naturalist beside the Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park that costs $59 a person would therefore be about $6 to $12 a person.",
      ", which offers group trips in Iceland, Ireland, Italy and Britain, recommends tipping tour leaders and bus drivers the equivalent in local currency of roughly $7 to $10 each a day, depending on the location.",
      "But the platform ",
      ", where local residents set prices for their own tours, discourages tips.",
      "\u201cThe guides are in essence entrepreneurs, rather than employees, and we suggest that the best tip a traveler can leave is to return to the site and leave a thoughtful review, which will help that guide to grow their business,\u201d wrote Paul Melhus, the co-founder and chief executive of ToursByLocals, in an email.",
      "Free tours make it trickier to calculate tips, even though guides work solely for gratuities. ",
      ", which offers city walking tours around the world, shies away from any guidance on tipping, noting on its ",
      ", \u201cYou name the price.\u201d",
      "In an email, a representative in the New York office of the company wrote that the range runs \u201canywhere from just a thank you to $100,\u201d with the average at $10 to $20 a person.",
      "On its website and in email communications, ",
      " is more transparent, recommending $10 to $20 a person for the guided walks that generally last two hours. Jeff Mikos, who owns the company, estimates guides average about $10 a guest on groups that can be as big as 30, but are usually closer to half of that.",
      "About a quarter of the group \u201cwill be genuine and thankful and won\u2019t tip, and the middle-of-the-pack average is slightly under $10 a person,\u201d Mr. Mikos said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always one couple with $50.\u201d"

      "Were I to write a Mari Sandoz biopic, I\u2019d start with a shadow racing across her desk. I\u2019d start at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 16, 1935. I\u2019d start with a 39-year-old hayseed \u2014 thin as a fence post and prickly as barbed wire \u2014 assaulting her typewriter on the ninth floor of the Nebraska State Capitol as a local bank teller plunges 135 feet to his death on the stone transept below. Perhaps I\u2019d cut to the fingernail marks he left on the observation deck five floors above, or the note he left behind. I\u2019d then creep slowly back up to Sandoz, red hair in a French bun, hands on her hips, standing quietly \u2014 even knowingly \u2014 at the window while her co-workers at the historical society buzz around her.",
      "Roll credits.",
      "Born and raised in the remote ",
      ", roughly 400 miles west of Lincoln, the author Mari Sandoz plowed her way into the literary canon of the Great Plains \u2014 just months after the teller\u2019s leap \u2014 when she finally published ",
      " the biography of her father, a Swiss homesteader. \u201cOn putting down this book,\u201d ",
      ", \u201cone feels that one has read the history of all pioneering.\u201d Before her death from bone cancer in 1966, she would publish 18 more, fiction and nonfiction alike, enshrining her status \u2014 alongside ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and others \u2014 as one of the most cleareyed chroniclers of the American frontier.",
      "I\u2019ve long felt a certain kinship with Sandoz. I, too, fled the Sandhills. I, too, graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I, too, began my writing career in the city. And I, too, sometimes chafe at my New York editors. \u201cDamn it, you and I know the East has long bled the west white, is still doing it, and I\u2019m to distort facts to please a book public,\u201d ",
      " to a friend. \u201cWhy, I\u2019d rather write my own way and dig ditches for my soup and hard tack than write lies for a yacht and sables. Row boat and rabbit\u2019s more my style anyway.\u201d",
      "Sandoz would eventually leave Lincoln, first for Denver and then for New York, but she spent more years in Nebraska\u2019s capital city than anywhere else. And though she criticized Lincoln throughout her career \u2014 calling it \u201cthe last word in decadent middle-class towns\u201d and \u201cparticularly unkind\u201d to writers \u2014 she would eventually soften on the city. Sort of. In a short essay for The Lincoln Star, the former morning newspaper, in 1959, she wrote, \u201cI remember Lincoln as our Greenwich Village,\u201d recalling long hours in cheap coffee shops and the hungry underclass of would-be artists and writers with whom she often commiserated: the poet ",
      ", the philosopher ",
      " and the short-story writer ",
      ", among others.",
      "So here I am, home again, half drunk and squinting beneath the Capitol, hoping to glean something more about Sandoz and the city she so loved to hate, or perhaps so hated to love. I\u2019ve returned to see this sprawling city of roughly 300,000 people \u2014 where the skyline sprouts from the rail yard and the subdivisions spill into the cornfields; where the streets are treed, but the wetlands are paved; where the U.N.L. campus hums in the heart of the city and the Capitol beckons from miles away \u2014 through the eyes of its most vocal and most ambivalent critic.",
      "Concealing a bottle of cheap ros\u00e9, my wife and I crane our necks. We stare. Nebraskans often call the Capitol tower the \u201cPenis of the Plains,\u201d and truthfully, there\u2019s no debating its phallic structure: 15 floors of Indiana limestone standing erect above the city, capped with a dome of golden tiles and \u2014 as if to avoid any confusion \u2014 a 19-foot bronze statue called ",
      " casting his seed to the wind.",
      "But I\u2019m fixated on the teller\u2019s jump, instead. I squint, he falls. I squint, he falls. And I wonder how Sandoz might have interpreted the same. In those hollow hours before she burst onto the national stage, nary a book to her name, rejections mounting like unpaid bills, she must have borne a certain empathy for the bank teller. Her own family worried she might commit suicide, so far adrift from her literary ambitions, and she once wrote that after so many revisions of \u201cOld Jules,\u201d \u201cI could have jumped off the Capitol too, but it wouldn\u2019t have improved the book particularly.\u201d",
      "I squint. She falls.",
      "When I first arrived in Lincoln, I rendezvoused with ",
      ", then 92 and a pioneer of public television, beneath the stone columns of the ",
      ", one of the oldest structures on the U.N.L. campus. It was in the studio below, he told me, in the spring of 1959, that he produced a seven-part series called \u201cCreative Writing With Mari Sandoz\u201d for the university\u2019s educational television station. \u201cI would rather face a rattlesnake than that camera,\u201d he remembered her saying, but as their work together progressed, she slowly began to relax.",
      "\u201cQuite frankly, if there\u2019s one photograph of Mari Sandoz and me that I wish I had,\u201d Mr. Hull said, \u201cit\u2019s of the two of us dangling our legs off the loading dock, both smoking my Pall Malls.\u201d",
      "With an elfish charm and bushy white eyebrows, Mr. Hull neatly unpacked his memories of the author: her generosity with students, her underdog complex, her staunch liberalism, her retreat to New York and, finally, Nebraskans\u2019 general contempt for her second novel, ",
      " a thinly veiled allegory published in 1939 about the rise of fascism in the Midwest. Little did I know, of course, that just eight months later, Mr. Hull would, like Sandoz before him, be gone.",
      "\u201cI personally think \u2018Capital City\u2019 was a hate letter to Lincoln,\u201d Mr. Hull said. \u201cBut it was here that she found herself. These people gave her the tools, and I think she felt she owed Lincoln a lot.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s here on the Capitol grounds, where she often spent her summer nights, escaping the heat of her nearby apartment, that I feel most connected to Sandoz. She once wrote that it rose from the corn lands like a \u201csort of modern tall tale,\u201d and for years I understood this as a compliment, as if she could hardly believe its grandeur. There\u2019s no doubt she adored the building. But I wonder now, as the streetlamps blink on and the bats flutter overhead, if I haven\u2019t mistaken her intent. Perhaps by \u201ctall tale,\u201d she meant that the Capitol represented ideals \u2014 equality, justice, democracy \u2014 that the state had not yet realized, or maybe never would. Perhaps the double entendre was intentional. To be progressive in such a conservative state was then \u2014 and is now \u2014 to be perpetually caught between hope and despair.",
      "But while Nebraska is redder now that it\u2019s ever been, Lincoln itself leans relatively liberal and has evolved in some ways that Sandoz probably would have cherished. Forever a champion of the underdog, and the daughter of immigrants herself, Sandoz would very likely praise the city for its ",
      ", for example. As a fan of contemporary art, she would no doubt frequent both the ",
      " and the nearby ",
      ", too.",
      "As an avid walker, she would appreciate the more than 135 miles of hiking and biking trails that now crisscross the city, in addition to the numerous wildlife preserves just beyond it: ",
      ", the ",
      ", ",
      " and more. And of course she would cherish the city\u2019s bookstores, particularly ",
      ", which specializes in Nebraska literature, and ",
      ", Lincoln\u2019s newest, housed in the old ",
      " downtown.",
      "For a more intimate look at the author\u2019s life, I meet up the next afternoon with Jamison Wyatt, a Sandoz aficionado whom I first encountered in college nearly 15 years ago. He now works for the State Legislature and served, until recently, on the executive board of the ",
      ". And since 2014 \u2014 by request only \u2014 he has ushered Sandoz fans like me on a roughly mile-long walking tour of her life in the city.

Today, that\u2019s just me and my parents, now tourists in their own city. It\u2019s a blistering 99 degrees. Not a cloud in sight.",
      "We start at the corner of 14th and P Streets, in the heart of downtown Lincoln, where Sandoz, then 23, attended Lincoln Business College just months after divorcing her first (and only) husband and fleeing her life as a rural schoolteacher in the Sandhills. We then move north to the welcome shade of campus, with stops at the former Teachers College \u2014 where Sandoz first enrolled \u2014 and the Social Sciences building, where she learned the fundamentals of her craft as a writer.",
      "From there, we head to the former department stores looming above O Street, the city\u2019s main drag, where Sandoz indulged her obsession with hats. Then to the old Lincoln Star building, where she took a part-time job as a copywriter, and past the ",

None of those tours were half as compelling as \u201cStalking the Ghost of Mari Sandoz.\u201d Not because her personal landmarks have been especially well preserved \u2014 in fact, most have been razed or renovated beyond recognition, including two of her former apartments \u2014 but because Mr. Wyatt\u2019s fascination with Sandoz is intoxicating.",
      "By the end of our nearly three-hour tour, I feel voyeuristic, as though I\u2019ve witnessed too much, and indeed, Mr. Wyatt\u2019s scholarship bleeds well beyond the pages of Sandoz\u2019s official biography. We know that her husband chased her from the Sandhills all the way to Lincoln, for example, where archival materials suggest he later cried on her doorstep. And we know, unlike most of her peers at U.N.L., that her greatest mentor, ",
      ", wasn\u2019t courting his favorite student, as the campus rag once suggested.",
      "\u201cHe was gay,\u201d says Mr. Wyatt, who explored the professor\u2019s queerness for his undergraduate thesis at U.N.L. In May 1941, Van den Bark was arrested with a younger man from Kansas and charged on scant evidence with \u201cimmorality,\u201d after which the chancellor demanded he resign. Sandoz, forever his friend and confidante, Mr. Wyatt explains, \u201cpretended like she didn\u2019t know where he went. But she knew.\u201d",
      "Mr. Wyatt later guides us through the Capitol\u2019s interior, from the yawning foyer bedecked with glittering murals to the parapet on the 14th floor. \u201cA fine place for thought,\u201d Sandoz once called it, with a sweeping view of the city.",
      "But down here on J Street, just steps from her old apartment, where Sandoz watched the monument rise, year after year, and the moon behind it, night after night, I\u2019m thinking again of her biopic. I\u2019m thinking of \u201cMist and the Tall White Tower,\u201d the short story she wrote not long after the teller\u2019s leap, about a young Sandhiller who flees his abusive caretaker \u2014 not Old Jules but Old Jillery \u2014 only to find himself on the Capitol parapet, one foot dangling over the ledge, struggling to reconcile life\u2019s disappointments, before finally pulling back from the brink. I\u2019d cut to her cluttered desk back home, a cigarette smoldering in the ashtray, and a letter addressed to The Atlantic Monthly sitting beside it.",

      "According to legend, Rome was born on April 21, 753 B.C., when Romulus, the survivor of its feuding twin founders, hitched his plow and furrowed a circular perimeter in the hills above the Tiber River. Everything inside was urbs, city space consecrated by priests who interpreted the will of the gods; everything outside was ager \u2014 unhallowed open territory. \u201cWe have a city founded by the auspices and augury,\u201d the Roman historian Livy wrote. \u201cThere is not a corner of it that is not full of our cults and our gods.\u201d",
      "Rome, in a sense, has been sacred ground right from the start.",
      "To many, Rome is the epicenter of Catholicism, the seat of the Vatican and home to a seemingly infinite number of churches. But in the nearly three millenniums of the city\u2019s recorded past, Christianity is but a chapter. Rome has sheltered polytheistic pagans and monotheistic Jews, adherents of Middle Eastern cults, and, in more recent times, a sizable multinational Muslim community. All have left traces \u2014 altars, temples, shrines, mosques, inscriptions \u2014 some hauntingly beautiful, others erased to stubs.",
      "Rome being Rome, these holy places are often jumbled together or layered \u2014 a church dedicated to the Virgin on top of pagan temples; a medieval church built over an ancient home that had a shrine to the Persian sun god Mithras in its basement.",
      "If you know where to look or what you\u2019re looking at, you\u2019ll find many of these shrines in the historic center, though a few require short treks by train or car. Most pilgrims to the Eternal City declare victory when they reach St. Peter\u2019s Square. But Rome and its environs conceal many holy places beyond the ken of the Bible.",
      "If you think that Roman religion was essentially Greek mythology with Latinized names, think again. Pagan polytheism in ancient Rome was dizzyingly complicated, the gods seen as constant companions who hovered over the city\u2019s mortal residents from birth to death, communicating with them incessantly but obliquely from their temples and shrines.",
      "The best way to get a handle on this divine welter is to take a walking tour. Begin at the summit of the Capitoline, the most sacred of Rome\u2019s seven hills and the center of the ancient city. Duck through an arch on the south side of Michelangelo\u2019s Piazza del Campidoglio and ascend the winding cobblestone alley until it meets ",
      ". You are now standing on the site of ancient Rome\u2019s most important religious monument, the Temple of the Capitoline Triad: Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Juno Regina and Minerva.",
      "Of the immense temple, nothing remains but a single painted roof tile and some tufa foundation blocks dating to the sixth century B.C. (a large chunk is preserved in the ",
      "). But if you turn your back on the tangle of government buildings and tiny parking lots that now cram the summit and gaze through the flickering gray-green olive trees at the Forum below, you may feel the wing of a god brush by.",
      "\u201cThere was a definite hierarchy among the Roman gods,\u201d says Licia Ferro, a classical anthropologist and co-author of \u201cMiti Romani\u201d (\u201cRoman Myths\u201d). \u201cThe major gods lived on high and had their temples in the Roman Forum. But there were also lesser terrestrial deities.\u201d",
      "You get a sense of this hierarchy as you make your way south past the ",
      " (an archaeological site with the foundations of two ancient temples) to the ",
      ", the classical city\u2019s port and cattle market. Here, across from the delicate eighth-century ",
      " stand two perfectly intact Roman temples dedicated to lesser gods \u2014 the toylike, circular Temple of Hercules Victor and the adjoining ",
      ", sacred to the god of keys, doors and livestock. Roman merchants, fervent Hercules worshipers, swore by the divine hero when they consummated business deals by laying a hand on his Ara Maxima \u2014 an immense altar whose podium has been preserved in the crypt of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. The surrounding quarter, anchored by the shaggy marble facades of the ",
      ", is ideal for contemplative strolling. With a good guidebook, you can time-travel through the years.",
      "A short walk along the Tiber and across the Ponte Fabricio footbridge lands you on Tiber Island, sacred to Aesculapius, the god of healing. The elegant Baroque ",
      " stands on the site of the god\u2019s temple, and supposedly the carved cylindrical marble wellhead before the church\u2019s high altar conceals a shaft leading to the temple\u2019s healing fountain. A hospital, the 16th-century Ospedale Fatebenefratelli, carries the island\u2019s healing arts into the present. The site is rendered doubly sacred by the fact that doctors hid Roman Jews here during the Nazi occupation, claiming they carried a contagious (and fictitious) malady called Syndrome K.",
      "Rome\u2019s Jewish community, the oldest in Europe, dates to the second century B.C., and by the imperial period the capital was home to tens of thousands of Jews, most of them packed into brick apartment blocks in the Middle Eastern quarter of Trastevere. \u201cThere were no ghettos in ancient Rome,\u201d says Elsa Laurenzi, a researcher in classical archaeology.",
      "Of the 11 or 12 synagogues that served this vibrant polyglot community, no trace remains. The site in Trastevere identified as the oldest synagogue in Rome \u2014 a humble brick house with a small arched loggia at narrow, cobbled Vicolo dell\u2019Atleta, 14 \u2014 is not classical but medieval. The Tempio Maggiore (Great Synagogue) across the Tiber looks old, but in fact it is a circa 1904 Greco-Babylonian pastiche. (Tours are available through the adjoining ",
      "; to attend Shabbat services, ",
      ".)",
      ", the old port of Rome (an hour by train from the Porta San Paolo station) and now one of the largest and best-preserved archaeological parks in Italy, is the site of an ancient synagogue. The majestic ruin stands alone in a grassy expanse etched with cypress and umbrella pine. Enter the sanctuary between intact columns (look for a relief of a menorah jutting off one of the capitals), walk on the black-and-white mosaic floors, and peer down a marble wellhead that may once have been part of the mikvah. It\u2019s likely you will have the place to yourself.",
      "The catacombs of ",
      " off the Via Appia Antica (a 10-minute cab ride from the Baths of Caracalla) is one of five Jewish catacombs that have been excavated near Rome, and currently the only one open to the public (contact ",
      "). Elsa Laurenzi, who has written about Rome\u2019s Jewish catacombs, notes that Jews did not come to catacombs to pray, considering burial grounds impure. But today, just to stand beside the small tufa niche where a Jewish child was laid to rest 2,000 years ago feels like a kind of prayer. \u201cShe sleeps here in peace \u2014 she was deeply loved,\u201d reads the Greek inscription on a marble plaque etched with Jewish symbols \u2014 a palm branch, a menorah, a shofar.",
      "The Romans, tolerant of foreign faiths, imported two gods that became wildly popular during the imperial period: the Egyptian deity Isis (a divine mother who ushered her dead husband, the fertility god Osiris, into the afterlife) and Mithras, the god of light in Indo-Iranian mythology.",
      "\u201cIsis was a sexy pagan version of the Madonna,\u201d says Enrico Ducrot, an archaeologist who now runs his family\u2019s travel business, Viaggi dell\u2019Elefante. \u201cHer allure is still so fundamental that it hits you at once.\u201d",
      "It has certainly hit him.",
      "Mr. Ducrot grew up not far from the Pantheon, near the site of the ",
      " Rome\u2019s largest temple to Isis. Though the temple has been lost beneath subsequent urban layers, the pink and red granite obelisks and statues plundered from the complex (many of them erected in piazzas around the city and displayed at the Capitoline and Vatican museums) give a sense of its scale and opulence. Recently, a section of the temple\u2019s massive travertine wall and entrance arch was discovered beneath a building owned by Mr. Ducrot. It changed his life. Late next year, he hopes to inaugurate the Iseum, a museum dedicated to the history of the cult.",
      "Isis, apparently, appealed to Rome\u2019s elite, but Mithras was the god of choice for working stiffs and battle-hardened legionnaires (the cult excluded women). Traditional Roman temples were set on high, like the Temple of the Capitoline Triad, and open to the sky through colonnaded porticos or an oculus, but mithraeums were the opposite: underground, cramped, hidden beneath houses, lit only by flickering torches. The idea that the rituals enacted in these holy man caves culminated in the slaughter of a bull is probably a misconception, according to the cultural anthropologist Roberto Libera, director of the ",
      ". More likely, the iconic image of Mithras kneeling on a bull and plunging a dagger into its neck was intended to inspire awe and fervor.",
      "Given the vast number of Mithraic sanctuaries, it is surprisingly difficult to visit one. The Basilica of San Clemente near the Colosseum preserves a mithraeum in its subcellar, but the more interesting sanctuary at the Circus Maximus is only (and rarely) open for group tours. One notable exception requires a 40-minute drive south of Rome into the Alban Hills: The Marino Mithraeum, discovered in 2005, features a stunningly intact wall painting of the bonneted, spangled, pink-tights-clad man-god enacting the bull-stabbing scene. ",
      " is open most weekends.",
      "The Islamic presence in Italy dates to the eighth century, but it wasn\u2019t until 1995 that the officially recognized Great Mosque of Rome opened in Parioli, a neighborhood that\u2019s a short hop by taxi from the ",
      ". The mosque, the largest in Europe, is a gleaming, low-slung modern structure that artfully bridges East and West. A fountain near the entrance refreshes a plaza whose pavement echoes the dazzling geometry of Michelangelo\u2019s Campidoglio, and the rows of twinned pillars leading to the travertine-clad sanctuary recall Bernini\u2019s monumental colonnade at St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "The interior is a study in curving lines, with low-hanging circular chandeliers ringing the central dome, intricately tiled walls and a rich Persian carpet swirling across the floor. You enter to the sound of bird song, you pray in a luminous rotunda, and you emerge from the compound into a pine and cypress grove at the edge of upscale Parioli. Except when a train rumbles by, it is a lush, hushed precinct.",
      "Maybe too hushed. Rome\u2019s fast-growing Islamic community, many of them immigrants from Morocco, Bangladesh, Albania or Senegal, resides on the other side of town in gritty, bustling piazzas near the Termini rail station. For most Roman Muslims, attending Friday services in the Great Mosque would require taking a day off from work.",
      "\u201cThe Great Mosque is a showpiece, a symbol, a place of pride,\u201d notes Imam Yahya Pallavicini, president of COREIS (the Italian Islamic Religious Community). \u201cBut the city\u2019s Muslim residents are more likely to pray at smaller unofficial neighborhood mosques, often located in private homes or garages.\u201d On a typical Friday at the Great Mosque, hundreds gather in a space built for thousands.",
      "The difficulty that contemporary Muslims have in finding state-sanctioned Roman houses of worship brings to mind the plight of Rome\u2019s first Christians. Unlike Jews and adherents of Mithras and Isis, Christians were violently persecuted \u2014 and some of Rome\u2019s earliest churches, including St. Peter\u2019s, are martyriums: sites where saints were slain for their beliefs. The churches of Santa Sabina, Santa Prassede, Santa Pudenziana and Sant\u2019Agnese Fuori le Mura were also sanctified by suffering. With their crystalline mosaics and thin, pure light, these humbly elegant basilicas conjure the time when a strange, fervent, unyielding new cult rose from the ashes of empire.",
      "Every age, every faith, every pilgrim makes Rome sacred anew.",
      "David Laskin, a frequent visitor to Rome, is the author of many books, including \u201cThe Family,\u201d a family history, and the novel \u201cWhat Sammy Knew.\u201d"

      "Britain teems with castles that offer travelers a chance to walk the same halls and sleep in the same quarters as monarchs of days gone by. Those who revel in the grand spectacle unfolding in Westminster Abbey may also want to soak in the noble lore in the old stone walls of some of those castles.",

      "Picture yourself on a sojourn in the Catskill Mountains of New York. Would your preferred game be Pac-Man, pickleball or backgammon? The answer could determine where you stay. Then again, with the variety of games on hand at nearly every one of the Catskills\u2019 newest wave of stylish resorts, there should be more than one option that tickles your fancy.",
      "The influence of New York City, Brooklyn in particular, has been palpable in the Catskills \u2014 about 100 miles northwest of the metro area \u2014 for years. About a decade ago, indie hotels like the ",
      " in Phoenicia and ",

      "But the Catskills\u2019 legacy as a resort destination extends much further back. It was where one of the country\u2019s earliest resorts, \u200cthe ",
      ", made its home in 1824, followed by hundreds of others. A resurgence swept the area from the 1920s through the \u201960s, when it became known as the \u200cborscht \u200cbelt\u200c\u200c, owing to the number of sprawling hotels there that attracted members of New York\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "Now, once again, there\u2019s an influx of new inns. While many are attracting families, others are targeting a younger audience drawn to a contemporary aesthetic that also evokes earlier eras, and curated travel \u201cexperiences.\u201d",
      "Those experiences might involve, in the winter, a \u201csled menu\u201d of five different sled types that you can take to the local hills, as Hotel Lilien in Tannersville offers. In warmer months, visitors at the new Eastwind Oliverea Valley can take guided walks to forage for spruce, then sit at the bar and taste its infusion in a handcrafted cocktail. And there are so many games \u2014 from Scrabble to shuffleboard \u2014 at these new hotels that you\u2019ll want to make sure you don\u2019t\u200c miss out on the epic fly fishing, rock climbing and hiking the Catskills are known for.",
      "\u201cThe Catskills were always great,\u201d said John Flannigan, founder and chief executive of ",
      ", which opened the Wylder Windham in 2022, noting that the Hamptons and Jersey Shore have gotten too pricey and traffic-clogged. The situation, he said, \u201ckind of naturally created a renaissance in the Catskills.\u201d",
      "A renaissance that has excited many and left others wary.",
      "\u201cThere are pressure points,\u201d Lisa Berger, the director of Ulster County Tourism, said, pointing to increasingly crowded trails, inadequate parking and \u201cpeople traipsing through people\u2019s backyards because a stream runs through it.\u201d The influx of visitors has required a new approach in some spots. For instance, reservations are now required to visit ",
      ", a popular lookout point in Minnewaska State Park in the neighboring Shawangunk Mountains.",
      "The new resorts, for their part, often refurbish existing properties, which means a lighter footprint. Here are a half a dozen to explore.",
      "In the 1890s, Dr. Frederick Lilienthal built a summer home in Tannersville, a charming village in Greene County near Hunter Mountain. It went on to be converted to an inn, and by the 1970s, it was a huge party spot \u2014 \u201ca total animal house,\u201d in the words of David Harmatz, one of the founders of Lost Boys Hospitality Group, which bought the property and opened ",
      " in late 2022.",
      "There\u2019s no whiff of frat vibes in the 18-room property now (except maybe the lounge\u2019s pool table and vintage jukebox). The California-based design group Field Theory respected the inn\u2019s original architecture and decorated with items found mostly at auctions and estate sales, drawing from a m\u00e9lange of midcentury, Japanese and West Coast influences. No two rooms are alike. An original octagonal room features a full-size bed, a vintage desk and wood-paneled walls, while a spacious king room has a rattan headboard and a leather chair. The first-floor lounge mixes even more materials for a layered eclecticism and has a bar and plenty of seating that welcomes the hang.",
      "\u201cWe had someone recently call us \u2018the living room of Tannersville,\u2019\u201d Mr. Harmatz said. As the weather warms up, the mingling promises to move outside to the oversize pool and requisite fire pits.",
      "For most of its 143 years, the Thompson House Resort in Windham was run by the same family. When John Flannigan of Wylder Hotels bought it in 2021, he saw its future as much as its past. \u201cThe vision,\u201d he said, \u201cwas to restore it back to what its original look was.\u201d",
      " is home to seven lodges that, together, make up 110 rooms. Wylder cut back trees and shrubbery so the buildings\u2019 restored Victorian architecture could be appreciated. Then, working with the design firm Post Company, transformed the interiors, particularly the main lodge, adding a restaurant, a bakery and a lounge with various pockets for reading, relaxing and, of course, playing games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be fussy or design-y,\u201d Mr. Flannigan said. The rooms \u2014 from \u201ccozy\u201d queens to suites to an entire four-bedroom farmhouse \u2014 feel bright and fresh with crisp navy quilts and wide plank oak floors. Eighty-two rooms also have oversize balconies to bring the outdoors in. And yet the outside keeps calling: \u200cThe grounds, through which the Batavia Kill flows, include a heated swimming pool, pickleball and other lawn games.",
      "It would be tough to find hoteliers who know the region better than the local couple Sims and Kirsten Harlow Foster. Since 2014, they have steadily been introducing inns across a southern pocket of the Catskills.",
      "The newest, ",
      " was born from one of the last remaining 20th-century boardinghouses in Sullivan County that hadn\u2019t been razed: the Armbrust House.",
      "\u201cWe let it be what it wanted to be \u2014 which was an old Victorian hotel,\u201d said Mr. Foster of the property\u2019s grand presence. The main inn has 22 rooms, a couple of parlors, and a bar and restaurant, decorated with vintage Catskills photos and cozy velvet seats and couches. A large front porch and terrace overlooks Lake Kenoza. Last June they added 10 bungalows, a nod to the region\u2019s bungalow colonies from the 1950s. Each has a private porch, oversize tub, gas stove and custom furnishings, such as modern fainting couches and sectional sofas. Even the walk along the wandering paths to reach the bungalows \u2014 which are perched above the main house, near the heated pool, spa and trailheads \u2014 can feel like an escape.",
      "When Rob Blood, the founder of Lark Hotels, was growing up in the \u201980s, he remembers being in the car with his parents, hearing Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and the Band on the radio. This is the vibe he tapped into when considering ",
      "\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe were imagining ourselves sitting around a fire with this playlist in the background, and what are the elements we want surrounding us?\u201d he said. The answer was plaid throws, leather couches and an old turntable with vinyl crackling through a speaker. The kind of space like the lodge\u2019s alpine lounge, tricked out with fishing gear, landscape paintings and local artifacts scavenged from nearby antique stores. Then there\u2019s the tavern, with its cathedral ceiling, stone fireplace and menu with local beers. \u200c All of it was designed by Rob and his wife, Megan Kennedy, as part of Lark\u2019s design studio, Elder & Ash.",
      "The couple\u2019s family \u2014 they have three children \u2014 inspired them to go big on the rooms. Some feature double queen bunk beds, others open up onto the back lawn with mountain views, and adjoining bi-level king-size suites can be combined to accommodate 10 people.",
      "Five years after starting Eastwind Hotels with a 26-room property in Windham, Bjorn Boyer, Julija Stoliarova and Dan Cipriani opened another Catskills resort in January: ",
      ".",
      "While the Windham property took over an old motel, they started from scratch in the new location, building 15 Lushnas \u2014 free-standing Scandinavian-inspired cabins \u2014 in a secluded hollow along the Esopus Creek in Ulster County, along with 12 other guest rooms. A dramatic pitched-roof structure housing a restaurant and bar, named Dandelion, anchors the property. It\u2019s communal space like this that is central to the Eastwind experience.",
      "\u201cWe try to program the space so that guests get to know each other and get to be around each other,\u201d Mr. Boyer said. That means turning over the restaurant to a candle-making workshop in off-hours and offering yoga beneath the building\u2019s eaves.",
      "Aesthetically, the partners are also keen to be welcoming, creating coziness through minimalistic but homey furnishings. The A-frame cabins feature queen beds, vintage lighting and d\u00e9cor, and Turkish carpets. \u201cI was determined to find pieces that stand out, are comfortable and have a story about where they came from,\u201d Ms. Stoliarova said. \u201cThey are one of a kind in my eye.\u201d",
      "While many of the area resorts being renovated date to the 1800s, the roadside Rip Van Winkle Motor Lodge was very much a relic of the 1930s before Ray Pirkle and Kim Bucci of Ramshackle Studio transformed it. Along with Mountain Shore Properties, the duo, also responsible for the ",
      " in Hudson, N.Y., took on the hotel, built and maintained by the same family for eight decades, and simultaneously restored it to its earlier condition and modernized it with custom furniture and amenities.",
      " offers 24 guest rooms in the main lodge and 26 log cabins scattered across 22 acres. Each is uniquely designed and decorated, some with wooden spindle bed frames, others with Shaker-style nook beds; all keep the rustic knotty pine walls.",
      "\u201cOur goal was to infuse modern Shaker elements without scrubbing away the sense of history,\u201d Ms. Bucci said. In the main lodge, which also houses Casa Susanna, a Mexican restaurant, they converted the former dance hall into the lobby, sanding the floors back to their original state and restoring a grand stone fireplace, which is flanked by couches and a library table. Come summer, the property\u2019s Swim Club will open, providing access to the pool, cabanas and an outdoor bar."

      "In March, on Day 7 of the ",
      ", after the court spectacle had already been branded everything from a \u201cmeme machine\u201d to \u201cthe whitest trial of all time,\u201d the retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sat in the witness box, somewhat deflated already. By that point, he probably knew that his pursuit of Paltrow for damages connected to a ski collision he said was her fault was a pretty bad idea. Sanderson claimed that injuries he sustained during the 2016 ski crash (including, notably, a concussion) changed his life, turning him into \u201ca different person,\u201d and \u201ca crippled vet.\u201d Paltrow\u2019s lawyer, the languid, unflappably stone-eyed Stephen Owens, stood before him, presenting Facebook posts \u2014 a lot of Facebook posts, some taken months after the collision \u2014 as evidence of robust health.",
      "\u201cThis is a picture of you and your girlfriend, smiling big, right?\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile, camera, yup,\u201d Sanderson replied.",
      "And then, the deluge:",
      "Was this, Owens asked, Sanderson hiking with his girlfriend? Was this him taking a picture of a moose? Was this him, looking happy? Was this him hiking again, and smiling? With a cool backpack containing water? Scuba diving? At an auto show in Germany? A shooting range? BMX bike show? Was this Sanderson on a boat ride along canals in the Netherlands? Did he do bus tours? Or go to Morocco? Twice? Did he go to the this museum in Marrakesh? Was this him at a rock concert? At a ski resort? Out with drinking buddies? At an exhibit? Feeling happy? Looking fit and happy? Was this him \u201cdoing yoga, or momba, or what?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Zumba,\u201d Sanderson corrected. And yes.",
      "As far as controversies go, the trial was as Diamond Life as you can get. For about a week, it lived in the media as a jaunty low-stakes holiday from the high-stakes everything of our ongoing ",
      " Amid a news cycle of war and school shootings, recession and an indicted former president, it was an almost-delightful diversion to have this little legal whodunit, this simple question of who crashed into whom on a resort ski slope so luxurious it might as well be covered in cashmere.",
      "As much of a trifle as the trial was for viewers, it seemed to be a real inconvenience for Paltrow, who said she was injured by Sanderson and infamously claimed to have \u201clost half a day of skiing\u201d as a result of the crash. Sanderson seems to me like an opportunist with an appetite for attention, or at the very least a schlemiel, possibly a little vain. The retired optometrist, the jury made clear, crashed into Paltrow, making him the offender. Unsurprisingly, ",
      "But what frustrated me in this trial, particularly in the questioning above, was that Sanderson\u2019s claim that his life was changed by the concussion was over and over again challenged or dismissed. Part of the reason for this assertion seemed to stem from the fact that, well, he seemed to still have a life. Owens heavily implied that a man truly affected by a mild traumatic brain injury like a concussion couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t go hiking, or travel, or make it look on Facebook as if he were living the dream. Or maybe the frame of reasoning was more that somebody living with illness \u2014 in Sanderson\u2019s case an invisible illness \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be doing those things. He should be in bed, in the land of the sick, no visa, no passport.",
      "The category of invisible illness \u2014 which means exactly what it sounds like: an illness or disability not immediately apparent \u2014 is growing sharply in America. Through the wonders of medicine we\u2019ve become great at turning life-or-death illnesses, like diabetes, heart conditions or certain forms of cancer, into chronic conditions that can often be lived with. At the same time, diagnoses of hidden diseases like Crohn\u2019s or fibromyalgia are becoming increasingly common \u2014 as is long Covid, which on its own might have affected as many as 23 million Americans.",
      "Sanderson is really not a representative whom anybody living with invisible illness wants: a person who could very likely be exaggerating or appropriating symptoms for gain; a man who identifies as a victim diminished by injury and then goes scuba-diving and sits beaming like a prince on a Moroccan camel. As far as advocacy goes, it\u2019s not the best look.",
      "Yet as someone who has, for nearly the past 20 years, lived with invisible illness, I can tell you that it is a legitimate look. My personal complex of illness stems from an unusual neurological condition called spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome, which leads to a brain with an insufficient cushion around it. I also have post-concussion syndrome. In my own decades with sickness as a varyingly close companion, there have been many points at which my life was truly defined by pain and disability on the inside, but still looked pretty nice and zippy on paper (or Facebook). I had two kids, I moved cities, I traveled, I hosted events, I wrote books and articles, I got out of a marriage that wasn\u2019t working, I had boyfriends. Sometimes I did some of these things very slowly, as if from the middle of a lake of glue. Sometimes I did them white-knuckled, with a brain that felt like a fat, broiling whale bladder. Other times I was more fine \u2014 like now \u2014 and if someone were to encounter me on the street, they might assume I was 100 percent cured.",
      "What I am describing here is the between-space spectrum of functional illness, a zone occupied by many with invisible illnesses \u2014 with feet both in the world of the well and in the universe of the sick. The sociologist Arthur W. Frank has called this cohort \u201cremission society.\u201d But I prefer to think of it as a society of walking wounded, because the term better includes people affected by illnesses including lupus, Lyme disease, migraine, endometriosis and, yes, the stubborn remnants of concussion \u2014 all of which are more chronically pooh-poohed, disbelieved or gaslighted, not least by the medical community.",
      "Oddly, it\u2019s a realm Paltrow says she herself inhabits. Just a few days before the trial began, the actor and ",
      " in which she seemed to suggest that her normal daily food intake was composed of coffee, bone broth and vegetables \u2014 a therapeutic diet she says has been helping her get over her own symptoms of long Covid and other health issues. (Paltrow later clarified that she eats \u201cfull meals.\u201d) But the interview, which might have been strategically given to position Paltrow as a sick person who got uncomplainingly ill and then took care of her own business through an anti-inflammatory diet and a stiff upper lip (rather than blame and the courts), backfired: \u200bNot only did it make Paltrow look disordered and out of touch; it also put her own health issues into the same quotation marks as Sanderson\u2019s. An illness invisible, and thus relentlessly questioned.",
      "So, I don\u2019t believe that Sanderson is a victim of reckless Hollywood royalty on skis. But I do believe his brain injury. Because I know, intimately, what a brain injury can do. And I know that between illness and health, there really is no zero-\u200bsum game. A man can have a life forever altered by a concussion. And he can also Zumba.",

Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and an A.I. entrepreneur himself, has been one of the most prominent \u2014 and critical \u2014 voices in these discussions.

      "Perhaps with no clearer motive than F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s observation that \u201cFrance has the only two things toward which we drift as we grow older \u2014 intelligence and good manners,\u201d we packed up our possessions during the last dark days of one December and decided to move to Paris. It was pleasant, I had often been told, for a writer to live somewhere where reading and writing were accorded the highest respect, and it was true that \u2014 in Paris at least \u2014 these were semipublic activities: In every park and cafe, on the Metro and on the benches along the Seine, people were openly engaged in what for me had always been the most private and solitary of occupations. Bookstores still held their ground here among the shopfronts, and the deification of French writers living and dead was evinced everywhere in street names and statues and advertising hoardings for new novels. I listened on the radio to an astronaut reading passages aloud from Marguerite Duras from his space station to his earthbound audience below.",
      "Then, last October, the writer ",
      ", the first Frenchwoman ever to do so. We had been in France for nearly two years, and amid the alternating sensations of regeneration and disarray that this upheaval had inevitably incurred, Annie Ernaux had come to represent for me a troubling point of constancy. During my initial months in Paris, when it seemed for the first time in my life that lying on a sofa reading a book was something I was not only permitted but encouraged to do, I made my way slowly in my clumsy French through one slim text after another: ",
      " ",
      " ",
      " \u201cThe Possession,\u201d \u201cThe Years.\u201d The story they told, rigorously excluding anything that did not directly pertain to it, was that of Annie Duschene (Ernaux\u2019s maiden name), only child of a working-class French couple who ran a humble ",
      " in Yvetot, a small town in Normandy.",
      "By means of scholarly excellence, Annie claws her way out of the mire of her origins to teacher-training college, marries the first man who presents himself, is submerged in a bourgeois purgatory as housewife and mother and slowly breaks her way out of that new prison by writing books \u2014 books that try to stop time by questioning and reconstructing as precisely as they can the events that have brought her to the existence she is now leading. Who is she, and where has she come from? Who were her parents, and why did they live as they did? Why did she act in certain ways as she became free of them, and to what degree is her life the consequence of those actions? Has she ever lived consciously even for one minute, or is this task of writing and reconstruction the effort to apply consciousness to blind fate?",
      "Despite the differences \u2014 of nationality, generation, social class, familial situation \u2014 between my own life and that of Annie Ernaux, I found myself plunged as I read into a more and more profound state of recognition. Yet what I seemed to be recognizing were things that no one generally admits. Ernaux\u2019s honesty had the effect of illuminating a profound and unsuspected lack of freedom in her reader. How, through the simple story of her origins, had she laid her hand so surely on the human tragedy of our ability to make ourselves unfree? The answer perhaps lay in her faith in writing as a sacred and transcendent activity. She believed in writing as some people believe in religion, as a sphere where the self, the soul, is entitled to find refuge.",
      "Who she was as a writer bore only one very specific relationship to who she was as a woman: They inhabited the same body. It was to this body that she was confined, actually and artistically \u2014 to its social and economic destiny, to its gendered limitations, to its geographical and temporal location. What had happened to and in this body, what it in turn had made happen in the years from its birth to the present moment, was the limit and extent of her material.",
      "France being a nation that holds itself in high esteem for its literary culture, the Nobel news caused a feverish outburst of pride, but also some startling paroxysms of venom. How could a woman who wrote only about herself be awarded the literary world\u2019s highest accolade? Madame Ovary, as she was called by one conservative French critic, was the prime example of the erosion of literary art by narratives of self-pity and marginalization. The intelligence \u2014 indeed the sanity \u2014 of the Nobel committee appeared to be questioned. It was explained to me that in France the exposure of unglamorous aspects of female reality \u2014 the complaints of the ",
      ", or housewife \u2014 was widely considered to be distasteful. There was also apparently the matter of jealousy \u2014 of Ernaux\u2019s success, of the youthfulness of her readership and now of this greatest of honors \u2014 among the literary male old guard. Yet it seemed to me that such explanations were, in fact, unnecessary: The aggression was simply the evidence that the nerve of truth had been touched.",
      "From the beginning of her 50-year career, the uncompromising candor of Ernaux\u2019s voice has wielded a formidable power of shock: the lacerating portrait of motherhood and bourgeois family life in \u201cA Frozen Woman\u201d; the masterly, pitiless accounts of her parents\u2019 lives and deaths \u2014 and therefore of poor, provincial France \u2014 in \u201cA Man\u2019s Place\u201d and \u201cA Woman\u2019s Story\u201d; her analysis of the extreme subjection at the core of sexual relationships in \u201cSimple Passion\u201d and \u201cThe Possession.\u201d One after another, her works have alienated or dismayed diverse groups across the social and political spectrum, from cultural patriarchs to feminists. It might seem evident that shock is the signifier of truth and reveals more about the people who feel it than about the artistic objectivity that caused it, but in the case of Annie Ernaux, the usual operation of time in reconciling people to truth did not seem entirely to have occurred.",
      "\u201cThis summer, for the first time, I watched a pornographic film,\u201d she writes at the opening of \u201cSimple Passion.\u201d She continues:",
      "\u201cThe story was incomprehensible; it was impossible to predict any of the actions or movements. The man walked up to the woman. There was a close-up of the woman\u2019s genitals, clearly visible among the shimmerings of the screen, then of the man\u2019s penis, fully erect, sliding into the woman\u2019s vagina. For a long time this coming and going of the two sex organs was shown from several angles. ... No doubt one gets used to such a sight; the first time is shattering. Centuries and centuries, hundreds of generations have gone by and it is only now that one can see this \u2014 a man\u2019s penis and a woman\u2019s vagina coming together \u2014 something one could barely take in without dying has become as easy to watch as a handshake. It occurred to me that writing should also aim for that \u2014 the impression conveyed by sexual intercourse, the feeling of anxiety and awe, a suspension of moral judgment.\u201d",
      " books one after another was like watching an edifice being built in real time, something raised out of the wet ground and constructed brick by brick. The harrowing beauty and brevity of these books and their apparent simplicity disguised somewhat the punishing cost of their honesty. Never had I seen the supposed freedom \u2014 the \u201cnarcissism,\u201d as we now like to call it \u2014 of self-examination so exposed in its brutality. Ernaux grasped the depths of isolation and loss she would need to descend to in order to retrieve the original reality of her being. Her art bears no relation to a privileging of personal experience; on the contrary, it is almost a self-violation. What Annie Ernaux understood was that as a female child of the regional laboring classes, her self was her only authentic possession in this world, and thus the sole basis for the legitimacy of her art.",
      "Lying on the sofa, I became slowly immured in the concrete reality of this edifice and of its facts. The girl Annie grows up in an environment of squalor and industry. She is an only child, an older sister having died of diphtheria at age 6. Her father runs the cafe while her mother manages the shop, the two spaces connected by a corridor that functions as the family\u2019s kitchen. There is no bathroom, just a toilet for customers and family alike out in the yard.",
      "Over time, her reality takes shape around certain foundations, the mother and father most evidently, and the cramped labyrinth of the cafe and shop with its simple living quarters above \u2014 a world without privacy or solitude, a world in which the observer is as exposed as the observed \u2014 but also around her own nascent exceptionality, which soon becomes the subject of her parents\u2019 mingled terror and pride. She begins early on to perform outstandingly at school. It is clear she will go out into the world, but what world is it, and how and to what end will she survive there? Their social conservatism and Catholicism \u2014 immovable features of the provincial working-class landscape in which they live \u2014 leave the subject of her burgeoning femininity and sexuality entirely opaque. Were she a normal girl, she would marry young with her virginity intact. This scholarly future is a vaguely nunlike destiny, whose risks of ruination include the possibility that \u2014 as a clever oddity \u2014 she might never find a husband. Yet her parents, and especially her mother, don\u2019t want her to be like them, economically and socially trapped in a cycle of incessant labor. At school, she quickly becomes aware of her inferiority, but \u201cat home, on her own territory, the grocer\u2019s girl \u2014 as the locals call her \u2014 has all the rights. Helping herself liberally to packets of sweets and boxes of cookies, lying reading in bed until midday during the holidays, never setting the table or cleaning her shoes. She lives and behaves like a queen.\u201d (I have translated this passage, and the others quoted in this article, from the French.) Her mother\u2019s one luxury is reading, a habit Annie acquires from her.",
      "At once cosseted and imprisoned by her parents, burdened with the prospect of her own liberation from everything she knows, the girl tries to contain in herself the violent forces of ignorance and desire, the problem of owing everything to people who can teach her nothing, the growing discomfort of her origins that is matched by the mystery of how one could live differently. Though she doesn\u2019t know it, her isolation \u2014 the only tangible result, in fact, of her exceptionality \u2014 is extreme. This exceptionality is the great subject and problem of Annie Ernaux\u2019s oeuvre, the Other with which she spars in book after book, sometimes taking the form of guilt or shame, in others of a savage and dizzying freedom. The exceptionality strives to normalize itself at every turn by making her conform, often to things that directly clash with and contradict one another. The conforming, sooner or later, results in rebellion: She is trapped and frees herself, creates and destroys and survives, learning over and over by this arduous and often disastrous route the opposing facts of internal and external reality. The exceptionality is not, in fact, that of intellectual or physical or moral attributes. It is the exceptionality of the artist, of the person who lives to tell the tale.",
      "In 1958, at age 18, she is given the opportunity to work for a month as one of a group of monitors at a children\u2019s summer camp in S, a village in the Orne. With this first experience of liberty, the whole unfeasible powder keg of her identity explodes. \u201cThe list of her social ignorances would be interminable,\u201d Ernaux writes of herself in \u201cA Girl\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to use a telephone, has never taken either a shower or a bath. She has no experience of any milieu but her own.\u201d In the middle-class world of the summer camp, she is by turns gauche and outrageous, short on manners, taste, charm and savoir-faire \u2014 she is, in a word, unacceptable. She alienates both her peers and her superiors, acquires a reputation for sexual availability and even lacks the discrimination to recognize what has happened. Yet she knows too that she is, for those people, entirely forgettable.",
      "\u201cI too wanted to forget that girl,\u201d Ernaux writes. \u201cTo forget her truly, meaning to have no desire to write about her. Never again to think that I ought to write about her, her desire, her folly, her idiocy and her pride. ... [Yet] there were always phrases in my journal, allusions to \u2018the girl of S,\u2019 \u2018the girl of 58.\u2019 For 20 years I have listed \u201858\u2019 among my book projects. It is always the missing text. Always delayed. The unquantifiable hole.\u201d",
      "During those weeks at the summer camp, she quietly abandons, without quite realizing it, her academic ambitions. She adjusts her expectations: Instead of going to a prestigious university, she will train to become a primary-school teacher. The weeks of summer camp, which at the time she believed to be the threshold of the future, were in fact a turning point back into the past. She would have to account for every moment of that past, both personally and artistically. What she had been programmed to escape was to become, in a very different form, her destiny.",
      "Sometimes, reading, I would experience the curious illusion that this 82-year-old laureate was not my elder but my junior \u2014 that her voice was speaking from a future in which the possibilities for female utterance were bolder, more serious, more liberal. I was as though chagrined by my own compromised femininity in the light of this more evolved future. How had she managed to be so daring, so candid, so autonomous \u2014 so free?",
      "The answer, perhaps, was shame: What Ernaux seemed to have understood from the start is that shame is the obverse side of truth. She uses it as a map, the existence of shame at different points in her history unfailingly leading her to a concealment of self buried beneath it. Besides, shame has an excellent memory, \u201cmore detailed, more indelible than any other. Memory ... is the special gift of shame.\u201d",
      "It was, perhaps, her shame about her origins that resulted in \u201cA Man\u2019s Place,\u201d the book that first cemented her place in French literary culture. Her voice, so unlike any other, told the story of a France that did not usually presume to express itself. Spare, methodical, relentless, shocking \u2014 \u201cclinical\u201d was the word chosen by the Nobel committee \u2014 the severity of its discipline was matched by its unrepentant liberty. This, then, was the strange fruit of the ",
      " in Yvetot, this voice whose internal stamina was indestructible yet recognized no conventional laws, that was capable of such suffering yet was so good at learning from it, that had escaped the bourgeois conditioning of character and thus was always stronger than the things that confronted it.",
      "arrival in Paris, wanting to improve my French, I was put in touch with a writer who wanted to improve her English, and we began to meet weekly for conversations that switched language at midpoint, like a soccer team changing ends at halftime. The writer was Delphine de Vigan, a novelist around my own age, like me the mother of two grown-up children who is no longer with their father.",
      "At first we were a little shy, a shyness that seemed to spring from our joint practicality. To be taking time in the middle of the afternoon simply to converse was a luxury to which neither of us seemed to feel altogether entitled. We had each been the wage-earners and managers in our households; each of us for years had written in extremis around the interruptions and ",
      "; each of us had the greatest difficulty in considering ourselves to be artists; yet we each, despite or perhaps because of the exigency of our writing conditions, had chosen the hazardous route of self-examination in pursuit of a somehow ineluctable truth, the truth of who we were in the world and why.",
      "Delphine de Vigan\u2019s first novel, \u201cDays Without Hunger,\u201d was an account of her near-death from anorexia as a young woman, but in the novels that followed she moved determinedly away from autobiographical material, so that that first slim and agonized text remained there like an unanswered question. What had driven her \u2014 what drives anyone \u2014 to starve herself to the point of extinction at the very moment of gaining autonomy? This particularly female form of self-attack seemed to delineate something, a corresponding shadow or a silence, lying centrally across the field of self-expression.",
      "I, too, at certain points, had felt at risk of becoming fundamentally separated from my own material, when my biological life as a woman began to generate conditions and experiences that were alien to and inadmissible in the writing of fiction. How was I to approach as a subject something whose power of nullification was so great that it menaced the very act of representation? To write about motherhood for instance \u2014 to bring objective scrutiny and distance to the biological invasion of the self \u2014 seemed to be not only a practical but also an intellectual impossibility. In order to succeed as an artist \u2014 it seemed \u2014 both the inconvenience and thus the reality of femininity had to be scrupulously concealed.",
      "\u201cMy mother was blue, a pale ash-blue, the hands strangely darker than the face, when I found her at her house that January morning,\u201d begins de Vigan\u2019s riveting 2011 memoir, ",
      " \u201cThe hands as though stained with ink, at the folds of the knuckles. She had been dead for several days. I don\u2019t know how many seconds or even minutes it took me to understand this, despite the evidence in front of me \u2014 a long time, awkward and febrile, until a cry escaped my lungs. Even today, more than two years later, it remains for me a mystery: By what mechanism was my brain able to hold itself apart from the sight of my mother\u2019s corpse, and most of all from its smell, how had it taken so much time to accept the information that was in front of it? It was not the only question that her death left me with.\u201d",
      "With this book, de Vigan spectacularly marked the end of her self-annexation, or rather the point at which the internal pressure of truth forced its content out into the world. Her mother\u2019s suicide was a sort of refusal or breakdown of the female narrative. To comprehend it, every aspect of de Vigan\u2019s reality had to be dismantled: the entire carapace of self, of history both personal and impersonal, of memory and fact and myth, of the collective life and the individual reality, and most of all of writing \u2014 narration \u2014 and its relationship to being. The book is not so much a reconstruction of her mother\u2019s life as a gathering of evidence, by which the private and subjective is made public and accountable. It required a painstaking examination of her wider family \u2014 a formidable and traditionally French clan of aunts and uncles and grandparents \u2014 and therefore of family culture itself. The resulting book is an inquiry into the \u201creality\u201d a child is born into, a domain tyrannized by authority structures and social codes in which the personal binds fatally with the authorized and communal to make a theater of blood relationships.",
      "\u201cTo write about one\u2019s family,\u201d de Vigan writes, \u201cis without doubt the surest means of falling out with them.\u201d Throughout her narration, she remains terrified and tormented by her power of disclosure, like a child being handed a dangerous weapon. She reveals, among other things, that her mother claimed to have been raped by her own father as a teenager, an accusation the mother made in writing at 32, sending the text to every member of her family. No one ever mentioned it: Life continued as normal, the family meeting regularly for Sunday lunch at the grandparents\u2019 country house.",
      "Midway through the book, rived with anxiety about the secrets she is revealing, de Vigan recounts a dream in which such a gathering of the long-dead is occurring. \u201cEveryone is there, nothing has changed: the collection of porcelain plates on the wall, the serving baskets placed here and there around the table, the smell of roast lamb drifting in the air.\u201d As the food is being served, a silence suddenly falls, and her dead grandmother turns to her, \u201cwith that sorrowful or disappointed expression that sometimes alters her gaze, without hostility. \u2018It isn\u2019t nice what you\u2019re doing, darling,\u2019 she says. \u2018It isn\u2019t nice.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing Holds Back the Night\u201d was published in France to a wave of recognition, selling a million copies and winning numerous prizes. In this literature-loving country, Delphine de Vigan became a modest sort of rock star, yet the aims of her book were in a sense challenging or undermining the tenets of that culture and the story it told about itself. Among other things, what de Vigan \u2014 and the powerful response of her public \u2014 testified to was the personal cost exacted by life in this exalted, beautiful yet patriarchal nation. Her book is a girl\u2019s story, her own girlhood as well as that of her mother, yet she finds that there is no template for it. Her mother\u2019s pain \u201cwas part of our childhood, and later of our lives as adults,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout doubt her pain formed us, my sister and me. Yet any attempt at explanation is bound to fail. Instead I must make do with a writing made of odds and ends, of fragments, of hypotheses.\u201d",
      " won the Nobel Prize, I received a call: I was invited to appear on \u201cLa Grande Librairie\u201d to talk about her work. ",
      " a weekly 90-minute television show about books, had often been cited to me as the emblem of France\u2019s exceptional relationship to literary culture. Once a week, the country sat down to watch a special-effects-free sequence of interviews and debates with the writers of the moment. The prestige and sales figures of these writers were considerably advanced by an appearance on \u201cLa Grande Librairie\u201d \u2014 an invitation was among the most fiercely desired laurels for the contemporary French writer. It was unusual, I had been told, for a foreign or non-French-speaking author to be invited; the need for an interpreter slowed things down too much.",
      "On the phone, I explained that my French was not good enough to accept the invitation. There was silence on the other end \u2014 evidently no one refused such an offer; it simply wasn\u2019t possible. What wasn\u2019t possible, I continued, was that I would speak French on national television when I was still capable of making basic errors ordering a baguette in a ",
      ". It was explained to me that not only would I do so, I would do so very well. A special edition of the program had been put together for Annie Ernaux: The author herself would be there. My appearance would be a nice surprise for her, and besides, they needed someone to give the international perspective.",
      "The near-hysterical national pride one might have anticipated at the Nobel accolade had, it seemed, been accompanied by some self-reproach. There was a general feeling that Annie Ernaux had somehow escaped appreciation, had been denied justice in her own country. Despite the French reverence for literature, it had required non-French eyes to see her true worth. The Anglophone world, for instance, had long understood her importance \u2014 it was seemingly as a witness to this debatable notion that I was invited to participate in the special edition of \u201cLa Grande Librairie.\u201d",
      "I went to ask Delphine de Vigan\u2019s advice, but she, too, seemed to be inhabiting this other reality, in which I could discuss literary matters in French before an audience of a million people. You\u2019ll be fine, she said. She offered to help me practice. Afterward we sat and talked about writing, about the blankness and terror that sometimes overcome each of us at the idea of having to write another book, as though it were some awful duty. Would either of us write again, if we had sufficient means not to? It seemed to me that for each of us it was this binding of writing with practicality \u2014 which for years had lent legitimacy to an apparently impractical activity \u2014 that now darkened the prospect of exercising our craft. I felt sure that neither of us knew any greater joy than that of doing our work, yet the framing of it as a job rather than art had become habitual.",
      "After the startling success of \u201cNothing Holds Back the Night,\u201d Delphine de Vigan wrote a clever, tenebrous faux-memoir called ",
      " in which the splitting of herself, first by writing the book about her mother and then by the extraordinary fame it brought her, is incarnated in a woman she meets at a party who insinuates herself into her life and nearly destroys it. While writing this book, she felt, she says now, the most crippling self-consciousness and anxiety, as though a goblin critic were sitting on her shoulder laughing cruelly at every line she set down. She was certain it was a failure and nearly didn\u2019t publish it at all: It was a huge success and won the prestigious Prix Renaudot, as well as the Prix Goncourt des Lyc\u00e9ens.",
      "This fear of writing, which is not perhaps a fear of failure so much as a deep and half-unconscious belief that writing is socially and morally wrong, seemed to me to be the very reverse of Annie Ernaux\u2019s vocational objectivity. \u201cIt is the absence of a sense of what one is living at the moment one lives it that multiplies the possibilities of writing,\u201d Ernaux writes in \u201cA Girl\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cTo explore the gulf between the frightening reality of what happens, at the moment it happens, and the strange unreality, years later, of what happened.\u201d",
      "On the set of \u201cLa Grande Librairie,\u201d amid the cameras and wires and blinding lights, where an atmosphere of sustained nervous frenzy was running through everything like an electric charge, Annie Ernaux was sitting among the other participants on a plush sofa \u2014 small and still and composed, like a statue depicting sanity. It was before the eyes of this sanity, rather than those of x million French people, that I would consider myself to be judged.",
      "For me, the conversation was like a ball being thrown very fast from one participant to another. I could understand very little of what was being said: My strategy had been to learn by heart a number of all-purpose lines, which I delivered every time the direction of the others\u2019 eyes indicated the ball was being thrown to me. Afterward I was ready to faint. The producer and presenter congratulated me. You see? they said. We told you it would be fine!",
      "There was a small drinks reception for us all downstairs, and I was surprised to see Ernaux, proud and elegant, standing there alone, away from the talking groups. Her solitude and apartness seemed like things she carried with her wherever she went. I approached her and said hello, and she took my hand and patted it. Hers was soft and warm. Her eyes were like searchlights. We stood there, our hands clasped together. I would be very glad, she said after a while, if in a week\u2019s time everyone could forget this had ever happened.",
      "Delphine de Vigan and I drove out to Cergy, where Ernaux lives. It is the suburb she describes in \u201cThe Years,\u201d the 2008 novel that finally carried her reputation outside France. \u201cThe Years\u201d is a longer and more ambitious book than its predecessors: The familiar facts of Ernaux\u2019s life are there, but this time they are integrated into a broader context of social history, political and cultural events, and most of all the advance of capitalism into every aspect of life in the second half of the 20th century. For the first time Ernaux sees herself not as the anomaly from Yvetot but as part of the wave of history, a gendered organism shaped and driven by forces both seen and unseen, forces whose operation around individual consciousness and destiny has been far more powerful and fundamental than the myth of self-will and personality would seem to allow.",
      "The Oise River, seen from the rise behind Ernaux\u2019s house, winds shining through the valley below among groves of bare trees. It is a square, somber house in a large, sloping garden: Its broad and unimpeded view of the river is startling. Along the lanes and cul-de-sacs we passed on the way the houses are closely packed, their territories demarcated with walls and hedges and security gates that block one another\u2019s line of sight and leave no space empty. Ernaux\u2019s ample shaggy lawn and trailing trees giving way to a wide perspective of sky and valley seem the fruits not of privilege but of artistic and moral consistency: She has lived in this house for 40 years, during which time the world has filled in all the space around her.",
      "Standing outside her front door, I was conscious that we were in one of her literary sites, the home that was the stage set for the woman she became, burning with oppression and desire and her indefatigable power of truth. \u201cFrom September last year, I did nothing else but wait for a man,\u201d she writes in \u201cSimple Passion,\u201d the story of her midlife affair with a married Eastern European diplomat. \u201cFor him to call me and come round to my place ... I had no future other than the telephone call fixing our next appointment. I would try to leave the house as little as possible, except for professional reasons . . . forever fearing that he might call in my absence. I would also avoid using the vacuum cleaner or the hair dryer as they would have prevented me from hearing the sound of the telephone. Every time it rang, I was consumed with hope, which usually only lasted the time it took me slowly to pick up the receiver and say hello. When I realized it wasn\u2019t him, I felt so utterly dejected that I began to loathe the person who was on the line.\u201d",
      "Ernaux was widely upbraided by her feminist readers for this portrayal of female dependency on male sexual attention: The clinical spotlight of her regard, so revelatory when it illuminates that which one is willing to see, becomes distinctly uncomfortable when it falls too close to home. Those same readers may later have found themselves forced to salute her for \u201cThe Young Man,\u201d her account of her relationship in her late 50s with a man 30 years her junior. She describes encountering, when out with the young man in public places, \u201cthe looks of heavy disapproval from people around us. Looks which, far from causing me to feel shame, reinforced my determination not to hide my liaison with a man \u2018young enough to be my son,\u2019 when any man in his 50s could be seen with a girl who was evidently not his daughter without arousing the slightest reprobation.\u201d",
      "She answered the door, beaming with welcome. Inside the house was filled with cold, clear light. It was uncluttered and tidy, modestly and tastefully furnished with antiques, yet it was evident that very little had changed here: The small, spare kitchen where she prepared coffee for us was a kitchen from 40 years ago. Yet the house seemed expressive of a double achievement: her rise from the ",
      " and her stoical resistance of the temptation to falsify or adorn the facts that surround her. We sat at the table in the sunny dining room. She talked about the imminent Nobel Prize ceremony, for which she needed to travel to Stockholm. Her main concern was her descent, before the audience, of a long staircase: At 82, she was worried she\u2019d fall over. We asked whether someone couldn\u2019t accompany her down, and she instantly looked startled. Later, I realized that this well-meaning suggestion was rather tactless: Her autonomy, her uncompromising independence from everyone and everything she has met with in life, was the reason she was going to Stockholm in the first place.",
      "When she talked about her age, and the handful of years she imagines are left to her, the luminosity of her countenance was arresting, and I was struck by the sheer aliveness of this creature and by her undimmed force of inquiry. The question, she said, is how to live when life is nearly over. What, in that context, can life mean? A few months earlier, she and her son David made a documentary, \u201cLes Ann\u00e9es Super 8,\u201d that is a collage of the home movies of their family life shot by her then-husband, Philippe, from 1972 to 1981. The images, so indelibly dated, put the past into a long and almost unbearable perspective. Talking now about the film, and about the clarity with which it summons back her past selves as a young wife and mother, she recalled the secret life that the images did not show: her determination, amid the detritus and preoccupations of conventional family life, to record her inner world in writing.",
      "She wrote her first novel, \u201cCleaned Out,\u201d in secret and mailed it to a publisher in Paris, giving only the address of the school where she was teaching at the time. She didn\u2019t even enclose a cover letter. The weeks during which she waited for a response were filled with the weighty sense of what she had done. Talking about it now, all these years later, she even recalled the dates: of the mailing of the parcel, of the stages of the wait \u2014 fevered expectation followed by doubt followed by the beginnings of resignation \u2014 and of the receipt finally of the letter of acceptance. When the news came, she realized that this was not to be a covert contract with the world, of news smuggled out of her domestic entrapment in an envelope \u2014 the people who knew her, most of all her husband and mother, would also read it. She feared her husband\u2019s reaction, sure enough, to this written betrayal of their shared life, but it was, she says now, her mother\u2019s response to the book that was in fact the only one that mattered to her.",
      "Her mother had come to live with them after her father\u2019s death, and she took the book with her into her bedroom and closed the door. Ernaux recalls going to that door several times during the night and seeing the light still burning through the crack. In the morning, her mother came down to breakfast and didn\u2019t say a word about what she had read, a silence that signaled her acceptance of the situation. It is extraordinary that this tough and humble woman, whose existence had been led under the severest constraints of a reality in which the breaking of social codes could have catastrophic consequences, could approve her daughter\u2019s actions in publicly smashing the bourgeois veneer of her family life.",
      "Proud as her mother was, Ernaux says now, of her daughter\u2019s achievement in securing for herself the undreamed-of accouterments of a conventional middle-class existence, she was prouder of her writing. In the past, on discovering them, she had burned Ernaux\u2019s diaries and notebooks, doubtless out of terror at what their content implied for her daughter\u2019s future. But in the official acceptance by a publisher she recognized legitimacy.",
      "In the bright, tranquil silence of Ernaux\u2019s dining room, I was struck by the force and meaning of this story, the power that a mother\u2019s acceptance could bestow on a woman artist, arming her against the whole world. After an hour or so, we took our leave. In the car on the way home, de Vigan and I spoke about the palpable and forceful aura that emanates from Ernaux and her home, an aura of unbreakable and radiant autonomy. It is rare, we agreed, to encounter someone of such strength. De Vigan wondered whether it was her survival over the years of the attacks on her work and persona \u2014 beginning, to my mind, with the dismay of her husband, who, unlike her mother, could not surmount his embarrassment from her manuscript \u2014 that have fortified her. I disagreed: It was, in my opinion, the fruit of love. From the beginning, her parents believed in her fiercely, passionately, as the most important thing in the world. The fact that they were the owners of a provincial corner store makes no difference.",
      "It is something neither of us had, I said, this unbreakable gift of love, the mother-love that extends even to forgiving the betrayal that is writing. Her own mother, de Vigan said, tried her best to be supportive of her work but was very hurt and embarrassed by the portrayal of the mother in \u201cDays Without Hunger.\u201d It is, I surmised, the reason each of us have struggled to contain the splintering of our creative energies around personal truth, this elemental fear of disapproval, rejection, abandonment \u2014 the grandmother\u2019s suggestion that what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t very nice.",
      " that the venom directed toward Annie Ernaux on social media after her Nobel win had become so uncontrolled that it was the subject of an editorial in L\u2019Obs, the French news weekly. When I next saw de Vigan, she was bewildered and upset by such hatred \u2014 where did it come from, and why? She admitted she had been slow to recognize the flourishing problem of misogyny in today\u2019s world \u2014 like me, she belongs to a generation who grew up believing that feminism had somehow already occurred, that the concepts of social justice and equality were as subject to progress as the evolution of science and technology. Yet if it seems that in our time we have discovered new ways of hating, this belief in the illusion of progress may be the cause. Misogyny, the oldest hatred of them all, plays cat and mouse with this illusion from one generation to the next, to the extent that the experience of misogyny, both private and public, could be said almost to have become a subjective state. If it remains difficult for women to make art about their own lives, it is because femininity still has no stable place in culture. Ernaux recognized and weaponized, as it were, the enforced subjectivity of the female voice. Her mechanism of honesty is highly trustworthy \u2014 but honesty, like certain talents, isn\u2019t heritable by the next generation.",
      "In the days that followed, I thought often of Annie Ernaux in Stockholm, descending the staircase alone. Her body, that which has been both her container and her subject, which has been the fragile, mortal basis of her empire, stepping forward into empty space.",

      "In virtually every circumstance that comes to mind, a steaming pile of rice is stellar on its own. But to top those grains with ingredients simmered in dashi and soy sauce, before they\u2019re set into a bowl and sprinkled with scallions and shichimi, culminating in delicious donburi, is another plane of pleasure entirely. As straightforward as these Japanese rice bowls may seem \u2014 (perfect) rice! Covered with (perfectly) poached ingredients! Served in a (perfect) bowl! \u2014 their understatedness belie their exquisiteness.",
      "Donburi can vary pretty wildly: The versions you\u2019ll find in the Kansai region can look very different from those in Kyushu, which, in turn, can differ from their cousins in Hokkaido or Kanto. And while there are many possibilities, some all-stars make repeat appearances: simmered beef in gyudon, tempura in tentamadon and raw salmon in hokkaidon. But in practically every iteration, a bowl of rice is topped with a thick layer of deliciousness and served in proportions that vary from the very humble to the deeply extravagant.",
      "There\u2019s a sort of holiness in donburi\u2019s simplicity, which is endless, permeable and variable. With its smoking eel just slightly grilled and settled over rice, every bowl of unadon I\u2019ve eaten at Kuromon Market in Osaka, tanked in the mornings after cartwheeling with the gays through the city\u2019s Doyamo district, has been the closest I\u2019ve found myself to divinity. And no matter how sleepy or hung over or hangry it found me, each bowl of tendon that I\u2019ve scarfed, standing cross-legged in a train station, has been just ethereal enough to carry me to wherever I\u2019m going. Even just watching the glistening bowls of animated katsudon \u2014 fried pork loins, simmered in eggs \u2014 in animated episodes of \u201cYuri!!! on Ice\u201d is cause enough to wonder what I sacrificed in a past life to warrant such decadence in this one.",
      "But while every iteration of donburi is three kinds of magical, oyakodon is what I\u2019ll always return to. The dish name translates to \u201cparent-and-child bowl.\u201d Seasoned chicken is simmered in dashi \u2014 alongside soy sauce, mirin and a dealer\u2019s choice of flavors \u2014 before it\u2019s ladled and guzzled down as the runny yolks meld with your bowl\u2019s filling. While oyakodon\u2019s exact origins remain opaque, one of its earliest recorded mentions may have come in 1884, in an advertisement for a restaurant in Kobe; by other accounts, the centuries-old restaurant Tamahide, in Tokyo, claims responsibility for the dish.",
      "My own forays at cooking it were, at first, failures. I\u2019d overcook the chicken. Or I\u2019d overcook the eggs. The seasoning wasn\u2019t present, or it was entirely too heavy. Or my calibration of liquid to filling wasn\u2019t quite hitting, overtaking the bowl of rice rather than collaborating with it. One of oyakodon\u2019s joys is in how no ingredient calls too much attention to itself \u2014 it just works. And while eating a bowl cooked by storefront vendors, chain-shop chefs, train-stall owners or restaurateurs, all working at the highest levels of precision, certainly has its joys, cooking your own oyakodon constitutes a series of tiny epiphanies: The chicken\u2019s suppleness, the egg\u2019s slickness and the reassuring tug of rice on your teeth make for a meal that\u2019s familiar and undeniably indispensable.",
      "So there are as many ways to prepare oyakodon as there are chefs, and the formula mostly remains the same \u2014 but honestly, it ultimately comes down to feeling. My ideal oyakodon might not look exactly like yours, but both will be delicious. And when you\u2019re cooking this dish, particularly for the first time, it\u2019s helpful to take heed of the recipe, sure \u2014 but also to the sound of each ingredient as it simmers in your pan, and how the smell begins to envelop your kitchen as it nears completion. With every attempt, your preferences may change, and with every alteration you make, oyakodon becomes squarely, and decidedly, yours.",
      "But, worst case, you could always leave it to the experts. I was recently wandering (flailing) through Hankyu Osaka-Umeda Station, in pursuit of a particular croissant shop (lost), and I remember passing the same set of glowing escalators for what seemed like the umpteenth time when I decided that I\u2019d settle for whatever nourishment I could get. A plethora of options stood nearby, but I opted for the closest, a tiny stall with just a few things on the menu, including oyakodon of varying sizes. The first bite tasted so familiar that I hardly thought anything of it. I was nearly halfway through my bowl before I realized that I couldn\u2019t remember the last time that happened: devouring a dish that was so very much itself that I couldn\u2019t be burdened with comparing it to anything else.",
      "I all but melted into my seat. But that wouldn\u2019t have been prudent. A line had formed outside. I packed my things, tucking back toward the station, so that the next person could enjoy this particular state of bliss."

If you are your father\u2019s legal representative, you can also apply for a \u201cdischarge upgrade.\u201d But the terms of your father\u2019s separation don\u2019t tell you much about him. Perhaps the imputation was without grounds. Perhaps he was bisexual; he had a long marriage with your mother \u2014 and there\u2019s the child he had while stationed in England.",
      "Either way, his discharge was unjust. Because you\u2019ll probably never have decisive evidence about his sexuality, the only sure thing you can tell your siblings is what\u2019s written on that paperwork. I can\u2019t see any reason not to share that with them, while discouraging them from taking it at face value and making unfounded assumptions about his marriage.",
      "Not knowing your mother, I won\u2019t second guess your decision to not tell her. Maybe she knows much more about your father than you realize. Or maybe what you\u2019ve learned would come as a surprise to her, and she wouldn\u2019t know what to make of it. Generally, people are entitled to the truth about significant matters in their lives.

If something terrible were to happen to her, you wouldn\u2019t want to have been a passive witness. But yes, a few aspects of this situation complicate that case. Victims of intimate partner abuse are often inclined to cover the fact up, and you have grounds for doubting that she\u2019d confirm your account if you made a report. Because you aren\u2019t friendly with these people, your options for intervention are limited \u2014 though you might seek further guidance from a local domestic hotline or advocacy organization.",
      "You\u2019re also entitled to consider your own safety. You could reasonably judge that intervening is unlikely to help the woman upstairs while exposing you and your partner to harm. In the meantime, keep a record of these episodes; if the threatening messages you have already received are too vague to prompt legal action, you can pass them along to the management company. But having hostile relations with your neighbors in a small building is a recipe for misery, all the more so if they\u2019re volatile and violent. They don\u2019t have to attack you physically to behave maliciously, and in ways that are hard to prove. You may conclude that your best recourse is to move out.",

      "On a Saturday night in early March 2021, Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, appeared on live television, seated at a long wooden table and flanked by the country\u2019s prime minister and interior minister. Vucic said he had an important announcement to make about the arrest of an underworld gang responsible for multiple murders. The interior minister warned viewers to move their children away from the TV. A series of images flashed on the screen behind him: a severed head, a headless body, a torso. Vucic spoke slowly, often pausing and staring ponderously at the table in front of him, his 6-foot-6-inch frame hunched slightly. He praised the police and intelligence agents who investigated the gang; they had narrowly escaped being killed themselves, he said.",
      "It was a shocking presentation, even in a country like Serbia, where many adults have painful memories of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and their atrocities. But the news conference was only the beginning of a campaign of gruesome revelations. In the weeks after the arrest in February, new details began leaking into the press. The gang was said to have lured its victims to a \u201chouse of horrors\u201d in a Belgrade suburb, where they were tortured, dismembered, fed through an industrial meat grinder and sometimes dumped in the Danube.",
      "The story captivated Serbs, and not just because of the gory images. The leader of the gang was a burly soccer hooligan and cocaine trafficker named ",
      " nicknamed the Trouble, already a well-known figure in Belgrade. He had been accused previously of murder and a string of other serious crimes, but never did much time in jail. He was rumored to have cozy relations with the Serbian police and intelligence services. He and his men had been photographed in the company of powerful people, including the president\u2019s son, Danilo Vucic.",
      "After the news conference, Belivuk offered his side of the story at a closed-door court hearing. He said his gang had been organized \u201cfor the needs and by the order of Aleksandar Vucic,\u201d according to court transcripts. He described some of the backdoor jobs the gang claimed to have done for the government, like intimidating political rivals and stopping fans from chanting against Vucic at soccer games \u2014 a valuable service in a country where the stadium can make or break a president. Belivuk warned that if Vucic \u201ccontinues his proceedings against me,\u201d he would have much more to say.",
      "Vucic angrily disputed any connection to the killers. But he seemed to take the Belivuk case personally, sometimes suggesting that it was a conspiracy against him. In one bizarre television interview a few months after the arrests, he claimed that Belivuk\u2019s men had made their victims into \u201chuman kebabs\u201d and sent them to Belivuk\u2019s boss, Radoje Zvicer. Looking into the camera and addressing Zvicer, who is still at large, Vucic laid down a challenge. \u201cI invite him to kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no problem with that, because it is better to be turned into mincemeat than to let these bastards rule Serbia.\u201d",
      "As the trial approached, facts began leaking out about the longstanding ties between the gang and various members of Vucic\u2019s administration, who appear to have monitored, assisted and protected it. Belivuk came to seem, at times, like the president\u2019s dark twin, a man who embodies the criminal underside of a state that has grown steadily more autocratic over the past decade. Vucic, who has been president since 2017 and has a lock on the country\u2019s ruling party, has long said that he wants to lead his country \u2014 still among the poorest in Europe \u2014 toward greater prosperity and membership in the European Union. At the same time, he has hollowed out many of Serbia\u2019s democratic institutions, and Mafia-style gangs often appear to operate with impunity.",
      "The Belivuk affair, in other words, is not just a noirish tale about beheadings and cocaine. The gangsterism that has thrived under Vucic, alongside Serbia\u2019s periodic threats to \u201cprotect\u201d ethnic Serbs elsewhere in the region, could eventually unravel the settlement that restored peace to the Balkans in 1995. The Europeans are keenly aware of this, as is Vladimir Putin, who has fresh reasons to divide and distract them. The Kremlin has a long history of supporting Serbian nationalists as beleaguered fellow Slavs and more motive than ever \u2014 thanks to ",
      " \u2014 to ",
      "But the risks for Europe run deeper than that: ",
      " and the spread of illiberal democracy \u2014 already gathering strength in parts of the continent \u2014 poses an equal, perhaps more ominous threat. The Belivuk case has opened a window into a grim possible future, one in which Vucic undermines the European project from within, building a state where democracy is a facade and criminal gangs are used to spread fear. That would be unsettling enough on its own. It also happens to be the same tactic used by the men who tipped the Balkans into a catastrophic war three decades ago.",
      " made his first public courtroom appearance last October, he had already gained a macabre kind of celebrity, his rise and fall chronicled in an endless series of tabloid scoops. He was led into the room in handcuffs, wearing a white polo shirt and jeans. His face was soft and rounded, almost cherubic, with big blank eyes. Despite his size \u2014 he is a big man with a massive upper torso \u2014 he looked oddly like an oversize baby, as if a lifetime of violence had made no impression on him. He and about 30 other defendants, mostly beefy men with tattoos and shaved heads, looked strangely relaxed, grinning and chatting and tossing a few casual insults at one another. Perhaps they expected this trial to end the way most of their previous ones had, with procedural errors, faulty evidence and early release.",
      "After a few formalities, a prosecutor took the stand to read the indictment. When he described how Belivuk and his lieutenant hit a victim \u201cin the neck with an ax and cut off his head,\u201d the man in question yawned and looked at the ceiling. Some of his fellow defendants dozed off.",
      "When Belivuk took the stand, he clutched the lectern with both hands and got straight to the point. His gang, he said, was a state project from the start. He recited some of the services it had provided and even described a meeting he claimed to have had with Vucic at a private house in Belgrade, giving the street address and apartment number and the name of the owner. They only met there once, he added, \u201cbecause, as the boss put it, if someone saw us or filmed us, it wouldn\u2019t be good for him.\u201d",
      "Vucic promptly denied the accusations and even offered to discuss them with investigators and submit to a lie-detector test. Legally, he is not likely to suffer from the trial. No senior officials have been indicted, and very few have even been questioned. The importance of the Belivuk case lies elsewhere. It has forced all of Serbia to face the abundant circumstantial evidence that Vucic has allowed gangsters to become a virtual arm of the state. The support Belivuk and his cronies received from the police and interior ministry over the past decade has been amply documented in court testimony, phone intercepts and photographs. The suggestion that all this might have happened without Vucic\u2019s knowledge elicits laughter in Belgrade. Before Vucic was president, he was prime minister, and a decade ago he reorganized Serbia\u2019s security services. He now exercises near-total control over almost every aspect of public life. From Parliament to the courts to the police to business, Vucic is treated with fawning deference; Serbs cross him at their peril. In fact, the arrest of Belivuk and his gang may be one of the few key decisions of recent years that Vucic did not control.",
      "The bulk of the evidence in the case comes from a team of European police officials who stumbled onto it by accident. They spent two years trying to decrypt a phone messaging app called Sky-ECC, which was a favored tool of ",
      ". When they finally cracked the code, they discovered much more than a local cocaine ring. With at least 70,000 users, Sky turned out to be a virtual Rosetta Stone to the globalized world of organized crime, with graphic messages and photographs flickering across the ether in a dizzying array of languages and dialects. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you were standing outside a house in the dark, and now you\u2019ve gone inside and turned the lights on,\u201d one official from Europol, the law-enforcement arm of the European Union, told me.",
      "Sky was not the first app to be accused by law enforcement of catering to drug lords. But it was the most popular and the most brazen. The company, founded by a Vancouver tech entrepreneur in 2010, boasted that its four-layered encryption was unbreakable; it ultimately made hundreds of millions of dollars before its executives were indicted in 2021.",
      "Much of the Sky evidence turned out to be from the Balkans, and especially Serbia. Passing that data on was \u201cvery sensitive,\u201d I was told by a French interior-ministry official, because of concerns that it might be leaked. Although the Serbian police did ultimately arrest Belivuk and his gang, they appear to have done so reluctantly. Days before his arrest, he and his top lieutenant were allowed to leave the country for neighboring Montenegro, another hub for drug trafficking. Montenegrin authorities said they foiled an attempt to murder them; a Montenegrin prosecutor told local media that \u201ccertain security structures\u201d in Serbia were behind the plot, which may have been conceived to avoid the messiness of a trial.",
      " in power, Serbian soccer hooligans \u2014 and the criminal gangs that overlap with them \u2014 have been enmeshed in the region\u2019s volatile ethnic politics and helped spur Serbian uprisings in other Balkan countries. Some of them profess loyalty to Russia. Some Serbs have joined the paramilitary Wagner group, which has its own history of hiring criminals and has posted Serbian-language recruitment videos for the war in Ukraine. Though Vucic rebuked the group, Serbia remains a kind of fault line between Russia and the West. All this puts Vucic in a position of remarkable power. In a crisis, he could decide whether the Balkan region will settle toward peace or relapse into violence.",
      "The most visible risks today are centered on Kosovo, the country to Serbia\u2019s south that is ethnically Albanian but contains pockets that are majority Serb, especially in the north. Serbia\u2019s leaders remain deeply unhappy about Kosovo\u2019s breakaway from Serbia following the 1990s Yugoslav wars and refuse to recognize its independence, which was established internationally in 2008. The scenario that keeps Western European leaders up at night goes something like this: Vucic, citing a threat to the Serbian minority, sends troops over the border and annexes northern Kosovo. Serbs elsewhere in the region then flee their homes or demand more border changes. This could spell the end of the Dayton Accords, the pact brokered by the U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, which ended the worst of the fighting in 1995 and redrew the map of the former Yugoslavia. It might trigger another war. Even without violence, the collapse of the Dayton order would bolster the politics of ethnic solidarity and autocracy throughout the Balkans.",
      "Another scenario involves Vucic\u2019s concealing his irredentist intentions until after Serbia has been admitted to the E.U. This Trojan horse script has gained credence partly because of Hungary\u2019s illiberal prime minister Viktor Orban, a close ally of Vucic\u2019s who has lobbied zealously for Serbia\u2019s admission. He appears to be hoping that Vucic could help Hungary, a member since 2004, steer the European club in a more populist and less democratic direction.",
      "For all these reasons, the Belivuk case has been a sensitive one for reporters. I was told before I came to Serbia that my calls would be monitored, that I would be followed, possibly even stopped and interrogated. The Serbian journalists who gave me these warnings have themselves been routinely harassed and threatened by both criminals and the B.I.A., the Serbian domestic intelligence agency.",
      "The gray zone between the state and the mafias in Serbia is real. It is also surrounded by outer walls of rumor and paranoia that make a reporter\u2019s job more difficult. I must have spoken to a dozen Serbs whose sons or husbands or children were killed under murky circumstances. Most of them had no idea who the killers were, but they had elaborate stories to tell about corrupt officials, drug barons, arms deals and incriminating photographs. Some had hired private detectives. All of them seemed convinced that the truth was being deliberately kept from them. Yet some of the people I spoke to were clearly hiding things from me. I spent an hour talking to one widow whose husband was among the butchered bodies in the photographs that accompanied the Belivuk gang indictment. She was tall and severe-looking, with long black hair. Her story was poignant, but when I started asking about her husband\u2019s criminal background \u2014 he had done prison time for his role in a notorious gang of Balkan jewel thieves \u2014 her answers turned cold and monosyllabic. I had the feeling that she could have told me a much more interesting story if she hadn\u2019t been worried about the consequences of her husband\u2019s complicity and perhaps of her own.",
      "Vucic is not responsible for this morass of fear and endemic criminality. It is almost part of the scenery in the Balkans, so much so that the region\u2019s very name has been used for centuries by outsiders as a kind of shorthand for ethnic hatred and violence \u2014 \u201ca stage set for exotic thrillers of corruption, quick killing and easy crime,\u201d as the historian Mark Mazower has written. But Vucic has the demagogue\u2019s gift for breathing new life into demeaning stereotypes. He has made brilliant use of Serbia\u2019s mafia problem, creating an environment in which the blurred line between organized crime and the state plays to his advantage.",
      " that both Vucic and Belivuk got their start in soccer fan groups. Perhaps more than anywhere else, soccer stadiums in Serbia are venues for power in its rawest form, a recruiting pool for militias and criminals alike. Stadiums were the crucible of the ethnic nationalism that destroyed Yugoslavia, and those violent emotions shaped Vucic and his contemporaries. Even today, approaching an arena on a game night can feel like walking into a lightning storm. Police officers line the boulevards, and as you get closer, there are teams of militarized police with body armor and shields. Fans sometimes chant slurs that recall those used during the ethnic-cleansing campaigns of the 1990s. Team loyalties take on an almost religious intensity. The chief executive of Red Star Belgrade, the most popular team in Serbia, famously said that Red Star is \u201cnot just a football team, it is an ideology, a philosophy and a national symbol. The Red Star is the guardian of Serbian identity and the Orthodox faith.\u201d",
      "Dead ",
      " alongside plaques, statues and other memorials that bear witness to their status as a kind of vox populi. Hooligans were among the first to go off to war in the early 1990s, and it was hooligans who provided the muscle in the movement to bring down the nationalist strongman Slobodan Milosevic a decade later. Ever since, Serbian politicians have feared the stadium and have tried to keep the hooligans on their side.",
      "Talking to Serbian hooligans is not easy. Some are dangerous. Most of the ones I met were taciturn and wary, no doubt in part because of the Belivuk case. After two weeks of searching, a Serbian colleague helped me find what I was looking for: a man who had grown up alongside Vucic in the stadium, and who was willing and able to talk about their common origins. He was a 46-year-old who still refers to himself as a hooligan, though he has a wife and children and rarely gets into brawls anymore. We met in a bar far from his neighborhood, so he wouldn\u2019t be recognized. He spoke on condition that I not identify him, so I will refer to him as B., his first initial. He has a compact body and a shaved head, and as he walked across the bar his gaze was so direct and fearless that I had a feeling he was charging me. We sat down and ordered beers. He talked fast in English, lapsing occasionally into Serbian when he couldn\u2019t find the right word.",
      "B. told me that the stadium was a rare zone of freedom and anonymity in Yugoslavia\u2019s tightly controlled Communist state. It was also a place where, by the late 1980s, you could see the country disintegrating day by day. Young men began forming gangs and bringing baseball bats to games, aping street gang members in the 1979 American film \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d The older hooligans told B. and his friends to find a similar group of young men supporting the other main Belgrade team, Partizan, and challenge them to fights \u201cto see who is brave and who is not.\u201d This pipeline is still in place, other Belgrade hooligans told me, and sometimes initiates must \u201cbleed\u201d another member to rise up the ranks before being given \u201cmissions.\u201d These may include committing crimes or just beating up a particular rival.",
      "All the young hooligans on the north stand were budding nationalists, B. said, including Vucic. Among the chants was \u201cSerbia, not Yugoslavia.\u201d After a game in 1988, B. said, he and his group heard about a clash between Serbs and ethnic Albanians. They went \u201cto hunt\u201d for Albanians in Belgrade after a game, hoping to smash up some stores and teach the Albanians a lesson. They ended up in a street fight. \u201cPresident Vucic was in that also,\u201d B. said. \u201cAnd I must tell you, I don\u2019t like him now, but he was brave, brave in the fight.\u201d (Vucic\u2019s spokespeople did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)",
      "Vucic has said he was in the stands during a legendary 1990 soccer brawl that has sometimes been described as the true beginning of the Balkan wars. It happened during a match between the Red Star and Dinamo Zagreb teams, and it quickly devolved into a melee that overran the entire stadium. Fans on both sides were clearly primed for a battle: Stones had been stockpiled in the stadium, ready to be thrown. Decades later, Serbian media published blurry photos of the match in which a lanky young man, identified as Vucic, is visible in the crowd.",
      "By 1990, the violence was veering out of control. There were thousands of young vandals looking for trouble, and, B. said, somebody needed \u201cto calm down that group, because Slobodan Milosevic was afraid of them.\u201d",
      "So Milosevic, who was Yugoslavia\u2019s president at the time, selected a leader for the hooligans. This was the first time a political leader entered into such a relationship, and it set a precedent that Vucic would later follow. Milosevic\u2019s man went by the name Arkan. He had a boyish face with a brittle smile that concealed a propensity for violent rages. Something about him commanded respect. Arkan was a storied figure of the Serbian underworld, who made his name with a series of daring bank robberies and prison escapes across Europe in the 1970s and \u201980s. He would go on to become one of the most brutal war criminals of the following decade. Photographs of his paramilitary group, the Tigers, helped turn Western opinion decisively against Serbia. In one of them, a Serbian militiaman can be seen kicking the head of a dying Bosnian woman.",
      "\u201cSo Arkan collects our leaders, he gave them good salary for everybody to be quiet,\u201d B. said. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018Don\u2019t fight with him. We must fight for Serbia now. It\u2019s going to be war.\u2019\u201d",
      "If the soccer stadium shaped Vucic\u2019s character, the war was where he learned politics. Fresh out of law school in 1991, he apprenticed himself to a far-right Serbian politician named Vojislav Seselj. It was in that same year that Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence, triggering the intermittent and brutal conflicts that would shatter Yugoslavia into statelets. Seselj, a proponent of ethnic cleansing, was a useful foil for Milosevic, who could point to him as proof that some Serbs were even more extreme than he was. Seselj\u2019s Radical Party recruited a militia that became notorious for its rampages in Serbia, Bosnia and eastern Croatia, where they robbed, tortured, killed and expelled non-Serbian civilians. Seselj once said his men would use rusty spoons to scoop out the eyes of their enemies, though he later claimed this was black humor. He was ultimately indicted and convicted of crimes against humanity by the United Nation\u2019s war-crimes court in The Hague.",
      "Vucic was an enthusiastic backer of Seselj\u2019s party, and he soon became the youngest member of Serbia\u2019s Parliament. In 1995, days after the massacre of nearly 8,000 Bosnian Muslims around Srebrenica, Vucic gave a speech in which he declared, \u201cIf you bomb us, if you kill one Serb, we will kill a hundred Muslims.\u201d In the decades since then, Vucic has never fully apologized for crimes carried out in Serbia\u2019s name or for his rhetoric. He has treated some convicted war criminals like heroes on their release from prisons abroad.",
      "In 1998, Vucic became information minister under Milosevic, his first position of real power. He presided over a landmark crackdown on the press, levying huge fines on organizations that criticized the government. It was the start of a preoccupation with the media that would help define Vucic\u2019s political career.",
      "But if Milosevic and his deputy succeeded in taming the press, they were losing their hold over the stadium. Many soccer hooligans had fought in the wars, and when they came home, \u201cthey felt they could be arbiters of national identity,\u201d I was told by Ivan Dordevic, an anthropologist at the Institute of Ethnography in Belgrade who wrote his dissertation on soccer and nationalism in the Balkans. B., my hooligan contact, put it a little differently. At the stadium, \u201ca new generation came, and they didn\u2019t give a [expletive]\u201d about Arkan\u2019s riches or his glamorous pop-star wife, Ceca, he said. They decided they had also had enough of Milosevic, who had brought Serbia to economic ruin and pariah status in Europe. At stadiums, soccer fans chanted, \u201cKill yourself, Slobodan!\u201d The hooligans linked up with the political opposition and began serving as informal security during protests.",
      "The big moment came on Oct. 5, 2000, when a week of street protests culminated in the storming of the Serbian Parliament, with hooligans leading the way. Milosevic resigned the following night, and for a brief moment, Serbians were ecstatic. In recognition of the role they played in his overthrow, some hooligans had their criminal records cleared by the victorious Democratic Opposition coalition. \u201cNothing in police, nothing in courts,\u201d B. said. \u201cWe\u2019re free. We\u2019re like angels. Clean slate.\u201d The euphoria soon faded. Serbia\u2019s economy was a wreck, and the European Union was not about to bail out a country widely seen as a den of unrepentant war criminals.",
      "For Vucic, the fall of Milosevic meant a moment of profound uncertainty about his own political future. Years later, he gave a strange interview that hints at his feelings of anger and thwarted ambition. \u201cI was sitting at home and seeing it as a tragedy for the Serbian people,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I went outside, some junkies attacked me, so I had to beat them.\u201d He thrashed them both and knocked them out, he said. But somehow these mysterious assailants got up and came at him again, and he thrashed them a second time. \u201cI went back home,\u201d Vucic said, \u201cand I knew, of course, that Serbia was in for years of collapse and destruction.\u201d",
      " has been shaped by feelings of loss and wounded pride. Serbia came under Ottoman rule not long after a legendary battle in 1389, a date you see spray-painted on walls all over the country. It did not fully regain its independence for almost 500 years. Those feelings were reawakened during the 1990s, when many Serbs believed they were unfairly portrayed as the villains of a complex civil war. They also deeply resented the American-led NATO bombing campaign in 1999 that forced the Serbian military out of Kosovo after it was accused of ethnic cleansing and murder. That expulsion allowed Kosovo, once considered a Serbian heartland, to become independent, another blow for the Serbs.",
      "Vucic and his Radical Party became standard bearers for their country\u2019s accumulated rancor. In 2007, Vucic led a group of protesters in support of Ratko Mladic, the military commander sometimes called the Butcher of the Balkans. A year later, when the Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested, Vucic was back in the streets, getting roughed up by the police.",
      "But the wind was shifting. In 2008, public-opinion research showed that most members of Vucic\u2019s own party wanted Serbia to join the European Union. Vucic helped found a new bloc, the Serbian Progressive Party. Critics derided it as the same old party with a different look. Nonetheless, four years after its founding, Vucic\u2019s coalition won a plurality of seats in Parliament. His party had deftly played to the middle of Serbian politics, promising prosperity, cleaner government and E.U. membership even as it catered to right-wing anger over Kosovo and other perceived wrongs. Vucic was too junior to become prime minister, but he gained control over the party. He was also given authority over all arms of the security services. He replaced the major department heads with loyalists.",
      "Vucic soon began styling himself as a warrior against corruption. He ordered a series of splashy arrests, and the media took to calling him \u201cSerbia\u2019s Eliot Ness.\u201d While some were legitimate targets, more than 100 of those arrested were officials of the Democratic Party that had just been ousted in the elections. Critics deplored the move as political score-settling. But the anti-corruption campaign was popular with the public and especially with the Progressive Party\u2019s membership, which skewed to older and less educated Serbs. The party\u2019s ratings shot up. People wanted something to blame, and Vucic had given it to them.",
      "Among the criminals that Vucic proudly boasted of having put behind bars was Darko Saric, the Balkan region\u2019s most powerful drug lord. Saric, the \u201cKing of Cocaine,\u201d ran a global smuggling network and was indicted in absentia after a yearslong investigation that included the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Vucic, who had just won the 2014 parliamentary election and was set to become the country\u2019s new prime minister, called the arrest a triumph for Serbian law enforcement. Saric, who had returned to Serbia voluntarily and surrendered to the police, had a different perspective. The chief judge in the case told me that he asked Saric in court why he chose to give himself up. Saric, the judge recalled, replied that he felt safer in Serbia under the new Vucic-led government.",
      " by the war in Bosnia, though he was much too young to play any role in it. One morning in the late winter of 1995, when the war was at its height, an explosion tore through the Belivuk family home in Belgrade, killing three. The forensic inspector at the scene that day was a man named Caslav Ristic, already a veteran at his job. When I met him in Belgrade, he was a retiree of 63 with a ruddy face, thinning white hair and a gruff manner. He had brought yellowing newspaper clippings about the explosion, along with his own Polaroid photos from the crime scene.",
      "Belivuk\u2019s father, Ristic told me, was a veteran who brought weapons home from the war; he was keeping two grenades in a kitchen drawer. He had been depressed, and after arguing with his wife, he walked off and triggered both grenades, apparently intending only to kill himself. His wife and mother-in-law were collateral damage. Afterward, the 9-year-old Belivuk \u201chad to go through the hallway, past the dead bodies, to the neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Ristic said. (The only visible injuries he had were some cuts.) Ristic told me it was an unusual case, but only because the father had killed himself with two grenades. \u201cUsually they just used one,\u201d he said.",
      "Belivuk grew up and became a bouncer in Belgrade nightclubs, acquiring a rap sheet full of petty crimes. In the early 2000s, Serbia was struggling with the toxic legacy of Milosevic, who had empowered a criminal class as a means of evading the ",

They were so powerful that in 2003 they killed the country\u2019s reformist prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, who had threatened a crackdown. At the bottom end were thugs like Belivuk, foot soldiers in the rising cocaine trade.",
      "Belivuk might have remained a small-time thug had his life not intersected with the rise of Aleksandar Vucic. Around 2012, as Vucic was gaining control over the country\u2019s security agencies, a new group of hooligans appeared in Belgrade\u2019s Partizan Stadium, and Belivuk was asked to join. Most soccer loyalties are lifelong in Serbia, but the leaders of the new group were mainly made up of people with no prior connection to Partizan. The group\u2019s name, the Janissaries, was a sly acknowledgment of this fact: The Janissaries were an elite Ottoman military force made up mostly of boys taken from their Christian families and molded into ruthless killers for the Ottoman state. Where earlier hooligans had informal and haphazard support from the police, mostly for drug sales, this new group\u2019s ties to the state were direct and political. Its first leader\u2019s name would later appear in the handwritten notes of a law-enforcement official alongside the label \u201cstate project,\u201d in evidence uncovered by Serbian investigative reporters.",
      "Belivuk and his new boss \u2014 a fellow hooligan called Aleksandar Stankovic, known as the Mute \u2014 soon began working closely with their patrons in the interior ministry. The relationship was exposed in a series of photographs and text exchanges that surfaced in a lawsuit years later. In one of the exchanges, Belivuk stressed his fealty, and an interior ministry official texted him back: \u201cShe knows. The boss knows. The big boss knows.\u201d The texts don\u2019t detail who he was talking about, but the minister\u2019s immediate superior was a woman. Vucic was then the prime minister and security chief.",
      "Belivuk would later claim in court that the Janissaries helped pull off a brazen demolition in downtown Belgrade that made way for a waterfront project that one of Vucic\u2019s allies brokered with the leader of the United Arab Emirates. That case, in which dozens of masked men used bulldozers to destroy a street full of buildings that were in the way of the project, remains unsolved.",
      "Curiously, the Janissaries also appear to have helped ensure the safety of gay-pride parades for Vucic. It was a little out of character for the hooligans, a flamboyantly homophobic crowd who had turned the occasion into a bloody melee in years past. But Vucic apparently felt that the violence was becoming an obstacle for Serbia\u2019s application to join the E.U. According to B., who was not himself present, Vucic organized a closed-door meeting with a group of hooligan leaders, holding up a thick packet of case files and promising them that any prior criminal charges against them would be suspended if they kept the peace during gay-pride events. The parades went smoothly after that.",
      "I wasn\u2019t able to confirm that Vucic ever held such a meeting. (Vucic rarely gives foreign-media interviews, and his spokespeople did not respond to my requests for one.) But Stankovic \u2014 Belivuk\u2019s boss \u2014 does appear to have had his cases suspended. When he became leader of the gang, he had already been sentenced to five years in prison for drug trafficking and illegal weapons possession. In the following years, the sentence was deferred a dozen times on phony medical claims, using doctors\u2019 forms that later turned out to be falsified, according to documents unearthed by Vreme, a Belgrade weekly.",
      "Soon afterward, Vucic was asked during an interview if he planned to do something about the rise in hooligan violence. He replied that he lacked the power to do so, because there was no \u201cgeneral social consensus\u201d on the issue. It was quintessential Vucic: part dog-whistle, part provocation and soon forgotten amid Serbia\u2019s constant swirl of real and manufactured crises.",
      " Vucic steadily reshaped Serbia into an autocracy. In 2019, the nonprofit Freedom House downgraded Serbia in its annual assessment of democracies from free to partly free, citing the politicization of the judiciary and other institutions and elections fraught with bullying and bribes. Yet Serbia\u2019s application to join the E.U. has rolled blithely along, as if the bureaucrats in Brussels haven\u2019t noticed that Vucic is moving in the wrong direction.",
      "One important lever of power for Vucic is the media. He has used the state telecommunications company to buy up local TV stations, and his allies run a triad of media organizations that shamelessly follow the Progressive Party line and give plentiful airtime to Vucic himself. These include a TV network called Pink that specializes in glitzy talk shows and reality TV. But the most shameless is Informer, a scandal sheet that features hatchet jobs and images of buxom women.",
      "In early 2017, Vucic announced that he would run for president. The campaign that followed was rife with accusations of voter intimidation, with some ",
      " according to a report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Media coverage was dominated by the party\u2019s organs, which smeared Vucic\u2019s rivals. He received 120 times the coverage of the two leading opposition candidates combined, according to Birodi, an independent research group.",
      "Vucic won the presidency by a sizable margin. With his party dominating Parliament, he now controlled every branch of government and was able to pick his successor as prime minister, a move that earned comparisons to Putin, who in 2008 placed Dmitri Medvedev in the president\u2019s chair to provide a mirage of democratic order in Russia. During Vucic\u2019s inauguration ceremony, hooligans, including a member of the Janissaries, helped to rough up and remove protesters. Vucic\u2019s governing style was becoming more openly authoritarian, with sycophantic public displays of loyalty by his allies.",
      "At the same time, Vucic grew more open in his courtship of the authoritarian leaders of Russia, Hungary and China. Despite all these signs of slippage, European leaders continued to greet him warmly, doling out investments and giving no indication that Serbia\u2019s E.U. application was in any danger. (In 2020, the E.U. donated about 300 million euros to Serbia and accounted for 62 percent of Serbia\u2019s trade.) The reason was no secret: Kosovo\u2019s status is still unresolved. The Europeans were pinning their hopes on Vucic to oversee a settlement. \u201cHe is very powerful, someone who can deliver on things if he wants to,\u201d one German diplomat told me. \u201cHe could be the one to deliver substantial progress on Kosovo.\u201d",
      "Vucic sent reassuring signals to the Europeans, but he had other messages for his conservative base and for the Serbian nationalists he supports in Bosnia, Kosovo and Montenegro. (He shares this defiant language with Putin, who has repeatedly affirmed his opposition to Kosovo\u2019s independence.) These messages are often delivered by Aleksandar Vulin, the interior minister, who regularly complains that ethnic Serbs in other Balkan countries are being mistreated. Vulin and other nationalists drop hints that their true goal is a Greater Serbia \u2014 the same dream that helped lead the Balkans into war in 1991.",
      "The gangs have their role to play in these political charades. Northern Kosovo, with its mostly Serb population, is nominally under the control of the national government in Pristina. In reality, it is dominated by organized crime groups that are widely seen as allies of Vucic\u2019s party and have been accused by the U.S. Treasury Department of conspiring with Serbian security officials in smuggling rackets. That gives Vucic an important lever to dial regional tensions up or down. But as tools of state, mobsters can be unreliable.",
      "The first sign of real trouble in the Vucic administration\u2019s relationship with the hooligans came on the night of Oct. 13, 2016. Belivuk had just left his Belgrade gym alongside his boss, Stankovic, when a team of assassins sped past in a black Audi and opened fire with Kalashnikovs. As Belivuk cowered behind a car, the gunmen sped away, leaving Stankovic dead. The crime scene was soon swarming with police, according to a meticulously documented story published last fall in Vreme. One of the officers, on the phone with his boss, shouted, \u201cWho\u2019s Belivuk?\u201d When Belivuk responded, the officer said, apparently referring to his superior, \u201cShe told you to go back to the hide-out.\u201d The gang had a new leader.",
      "The murder may have been related to Stankovic\u2019s role as a \u201cstate project.\u201d According to the Vreme report, Stankovic, who had been driving around in an armored Audi outfitted with a police radio, was receiving cocaine shipments at lower prices than other gangsters, and they were angry. But the broader lesson of the Stankovic murder was that the Belivuk gang had become embroiled in an increasingly violent war among the region\u2019s drug clans. The cocaine trade was more profitable than ever, with Latin American cartels turning their eyes to the growing European market. Although much of Europe\u2019s cocaine arrives via container ports in Northern Europe, the Balkan route was becoming more important, and much of it was focused on Montenegro, Serbia\u2019s southern neighbor. Montenegro is tiny \u2014 the population is just over 600,000 \u2014 but it has certain features that make it well suited to the trade, including a long Adriatic coastline. Like Sicily, it is poor and dominated by clans with a reputation for lawlessness. And it has a history of smuggling, a practice abetted by the government during the civil wars of the 1990s.",
      "The gang war started after the fall of Darko Saric, the drug lord whose arrest Vucic announced with such ceremony in 2014. Saric had built a narcotics base in Kotor, a gorgeous medieval port town on the Montenegrin coast that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. A group of Kotor traffickers inherited his mantle and then split into rival clans over a 200-kilogram shipment of cocaine. The war quickly turned deadly, with tit-for-tat assassinations taking place in Serbia and Montenegro. The warring clans, Kavac and Skaljar, had built ties to police and intelligence agencies across the Balkans, which were being drawn into the violence.",
      "Stankovic\u2019s murder was seen in Belgrade as a sign that the war of the clans was getting out of hand. On the morning after Stankovic\u2019s death, the Serbian interior minister at the time, Nebojsa Stefanovic, held a news conference to announce that enough was enough: It was time to crack down on the mafia. As it happened, things were about to get much worse.",
      " as boss was to change his gang\u2019s name to the Principi. In an interview with a Belgrade weekly \u2014 the only one he is known to have given \u2014 he said it was because he acted \u201cfrom principles.\u201d He did not say what those principles were. The name carried another tacit association: Gavrilo Princip, the Bosnian Serb nationalist who set off the First World War by killing Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 and who is still widely considered a hero among Serbs for his brave stand against the Austro-Hungarian empire.",
      "Belivuk made bigger headlines a few months later, when he and his top lieutenant, Marko Milikjovic, known as the Butcher, were accused of gunning down a man in central Belgrade. The victim was a martial-arts expert who worked security at a Belgrade nightclub on one of the riverfront rafts. On his favorite outlet, Pink TV, President Vucic explained that this man was targeted \u201cbecause he prevented some of Belivuk\u2019s and Milikjovic\u2019s people from taking over the rafts. When you come to the bunker at the stadium, you get a gram of drugs for 50 euros, and then it spreads throughout Serbia, they sell it on the raft for 70. That price only goes up. And that\u2019s why this man was killed.\u201d Hearing that, Belivuk might easily have imagined that his state support had dried up. Instead, a familiar pattern reasserted itself. The DNA evidence implicating Belivuk mysteriously disappeared, and he and his deputy were both acquitted (though they did serve some jail time before the verdict).",
      "Another sign of Belivuk\u2019s untouchability was the appearance of a guest in the soccer stands: Danilo Vucic, the president\u2019s oldest son. Photographs of Danilo with his arms around members of the Belivuk gang appeared in Belgrade\u2019s independent media, prompting the president to lash out in fury and accuse reporters of unfairly targeting his family. Vucic has repeatedly said that his son, who works in a wine shop, is a private citizen with no official position. But Danilo appears to play an ambiguously political role. Two years ago, he publicly welcomed a Serbian war criminal after he had served his time in Croatia, and, according to Serbian media reports, handed him $30,000 in cash, along with the keys to a Belgrade apartment and a car. The origin of this largess has not been explained. (Vucic\u2019s spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.) Danilo has also been photographed standing with the leader of the People\u2019s Patrol, a far-right nationalist group that stages anti-immigration protests and recently threatened to cross the border in defense of ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo.",
      "By 2019, Belivuk and his gang had established a bunker inside Partizan stadium where they tortured victims and stored drugs and weapons. They had bigger things on their minds than soccer: The war between the two Montenegrin cocaine factions was upending organized crime across the region. \u201cMost significant organized criminal groups have decided to join one of these two rival criminal groups,\u201d was the conclusion of a Serbian intelligence document, cited in an investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an international consortium, in May 2020.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just criminals driving the clan war. Some Serbian and Montenegrin police and intelligence agencies had sided with the Kavac clan, according to the information from the reporting project. (The police in both countries deny any connection with the gangs.) The assassinations started in the streets of Belgrade and Podgorica but soon spread to Spain, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Greece. Several Balkan reporters who have monitored the clan war told me that the current body count is more than 70.",
      "The Belivuk gang was becoming more visible beyond Serbia\u2019s borders. In 2019, the Spanish Coast Guard seized 800 kilograms of cocaine on a ship coming from South America. The drugs were worth 50 million euros. Although there is no evidence that the three Serbian sailors on the boat were directly linked to the Belivuk gang, many of the cocaine packages bore the image of Gavrilo Princip, the gang\u2019s signature.",
      "There is little doubt that Belivuk and his gang are in prison because Europol cracked the code on Sky-ECC, exposing the group\u2019s incriminating texts and photographs. What remains unclear is what the Serbian authorities knew and what they intended to do about it. The Europol officials I met with in The Hague were cagey about how and when they communicated with Serbia regarding the Sky data. Officially, the intercepts were handed over after Belivuk\u2019s arrest, and those intercepts formed the basis of the indictment. But Europol (or one of its partners) appears to have tipped off the Serbs several months earlier. Serbia\u2019s former interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic, said as much, asserting that the arrest was made possible by Sky intercepts. And in October 2020 Vucic, during a rambling statement about gang violence, said he had been hearing about gruesome crimes for weeks, then added cryptically, \u201cAnd don\u2019t let the whole town tell us about how someone cut someone\u2019s head off via Skype.\u201d",
      "That comment got the attention of Stevan Dojcinovic, one of Serbia\u2019s foremost investigative reporters. Dojcinovic is a founder of the Crime and Corruption Reporting Network and has been writing about the Belivuk gang and its ties to the state since 2016. He has been the target of many threats and attacks in the Vucic-allied media, which have labeled him, among other things, a terrorist, a spy, a mobster, a drug addict, a traitor and a sadomasochist. Dojcinovic is a small man with a sensitive, foxlike face and a nose ring. He and his staff work out of a Belgrade office so tiny and full of documents that walking into it is like entering an overstuffed closet. Dojcinovic told me that he believes Vucic\u2019s comment about beheadings (he apparently confused Sky with Skype) may have been a final warning to the gang. \u201cThe Belivuk gang had been useful to the state, but they were getting out of control, getting too violent,\u201d Dojcinovic said. \u201cAlso they were being watched from outside, the Europeans had informed the Serbian police about the Sky intercepts.\u201d",
      "If Dojcinovic is right, the Serbian authorities had not decided what to do about Belivuk and his gang as late as October 2020. They were definitely concerned, because court documents show that the Serbian police started surveilling the gang in early August, six months before the arrests. But it seems they were not concerned enough to stop the gang from torturing and killing people.",
      "Thanks to the Sky-ECC messages uncovered by Europol, we now have an appallingly precise record of what happened to some of the men who started disappearing in Belgrade in 2019. The Belivuk gang developed a murder routine and refined it, with dozens of henchmen playing different roles. Sometimes they tempted the victim with drug or gun deals; in one case they tricked a rival into believing an associate had captured Belivuk and he could now kill him. The Sky text messages often provide a minute-by-minute trail of the crimes.",
      "One of the men they targeted was a 33-year-old rival hooligan leader named Goran Velickovic. He was a prominent, well-liked figure at Partizan Stadium. He was married to his childhood sweetheart and had two small children and a job with his cousin fixing windows. In photographs, he has ruddy cheeks, cheerful brown eyes and a massive chest, with a tattoo visible on his thickly muscled right forearm that says \u201cThe Young Boys,\u201d the name of his fan group.",
      "Velickovic knew all about the stadium and its rivalries. What troubled him, his widow, Jelena, told me, was the role the police played. \u201cThe thing that really worried us, there were police who were there to provide assistance to rival groups,\u201d Jelena said. \u201cIf you\u2019re part of such a group, it gives you unimaginable power. And if you\u2019re against that group, you cannot protect yourself.\u201d",
      "In early August 2020, Goran went out to meet a friend and never came back. It would be months before Jelena knew for certain what happened. Only when she saw the Sky evidence from the indictment did she understand: Goran had been lured out of Belgrade by a man he trusted to a dirt road alongside a deserted wheat field. The Belivuk gang ambushed him, tied him up and drove him to their slaughterhouse, even as Jelena was feeding the babies and making dinner for her husband.",
      "The gang had prepared a torture chamber in a hidden room accessed via the garage. There were handcuffs and straps, along with blades, hot irons and disposable work clothes. The meat grinder stood at one end. Before every murder, gang members laid out fresh plastic sheeting on the floor and walls.",
      "According to the indictment, they brought Goran inside the room and interrogated him, forcing him to unlock his phone and go through his contacts. They pulled off his fingernails with pliers, beat him, and finished him off by beheading him with an ax. They carved an insult onto Goran\u2019s back with a knife, took some photographs and sent them to contacts on his phone. One photo went with a text: \u201cSee honey? Mexico in the middle of Belgrade.\u201d",
      "The gang\u2019s leaders, the Sky intercepts reveal, often reveled in torture. During another murder a few weeks later, Belivuk and his right-hand man called in on their Sky phones from Montenegro (where they were carrying out three other killings) to encourage their henchmen in Belgrade to give \u201c102 percent of yourself\u201d to the torture of the latest victim. The Sky transcripts show that they asked the phone to be put close to the victim so that they could curse him and tell him they were planning to kill his father and brother and \u201ceverything you\u2019ve ever known and loved.\u201d Later, Belivuk texted again, asking one of his subordinates to describe the torture at length and \u201cdon\u2019t skip those juicy details for me.\u201d",
      "After each victim was dead, the men followed the same ritual. They used axes and knives to cut the body into small chunks, then fed them through the meat grinder, gathering the remains in bags which they upended into the Danube. They burned the bags, along with all the victim\u2019s clothes and belongings. They also destroyed the bloodied plastic sheeting and cleaned the meat grinder with acid and bleach. But that was not the end of it. In almost every case, prosecutors say, they texted the victim\u2019s family members, often pretending to be him, and found ways to extract money, drugs and cars.",
      "Jelena Velickovic told me that until the day she found out what happened to her husband \u2014 by seeing photographs of his mangled body on a Serbian TV show \u2014 she found it hard to believe that Belivuk was responsible.",
      "\u201cHe was almost a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cI met him lots of times at the stadium. My husband, too.\u201d Years earlier, when she took her first child to the stadium for a game, it was Belivuk who congratulated her. And, in keeping with Serbian custom, he even gave her money for the baby, a gift of 50 euros. \u201cHe was nice at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI could never imagine that a guy who gave us gifts for our child, that this guy could kill my husband.\u201d",
      "Jelena is a small woman with large, dark eyes, round features and a look of resigned melancholy. Tattoos cover her arms, including a recent one that says in Serbian, \u201cThe pain I feel today will be my power tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Jelena\u2019s lawyer, sitting with us, told me she believed Belivuk and his men weren\u2019t born monsters. It took the government to make that happen. \u201cBelivuk was a victim of unrealistic expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had illusions of grandeur. He and his friends became victims themselves. Someone fed them delusions.\u201d",
      "In the two years since the Belivuk gang was arrested, Vucic has repeatedly said the case marked a decisive break with the past. \u201cWe will clean the state institutions of all their collaborators,\u201d he declared at the first news conference after the arrests. He later told a group of journalists: \u201cThis is important for us, but also for ordinary citizens. Restaurant and bar owners will not have to worry about someone coming and wanting to racketeer them and then they are afraid to report it to the police because they don\u2019t know if someone in the police is well connected to these killers.\u201d It was a message calculated to appeal to Serbs who were troubled by what they heard about the Belivuk case. It may also have been aimed at the European Union, which will not admit Serbia to the club until it gets more serious about the rule of law.",
      "There were a number of reasons to doubt the president\u2019s promise. He has said similar things in the past, and Belivuk is widely viewed in Serbia as the latest in a long series of useful thugs, as replaceable as Aleksandar Stankovic before him. The bigger reason is that the Serbian authorities continue to be cozy with drug dealers and gangs. One of the more sensational recent examples was the discovery of a sprawling marijuana farm 30 miles outside Belgrade that, according to prosecutors, was being protected by police and military officers. The farm, designed to produce highly concentrated forms of cannabis, appears to have been Europe\u2019s largest.",
      "And Vucic\u2019s relationship with outlaws goes beyond Serbia. In 2018, a Kosovo businessman who is accused by the U.S. TreasuryDepartment of large-scale drug and weapons trafficking was charged in the murder of a politician there. Vucic defended him, calling him \u201ca man who defends the Serbian people and the hearths of northern Kosovo.\u201d Paradoxically, Vucic\u2019s influence in northern Kosovo is part of the reason the European Union sees him as a valuable partner. He demonstrated that power late last year during a border crisis that briefly threatened to tip into open conflict.",
      "The confrontation heated up, perhaps not coincidentally, during a European Union summit meeting in December at which Vucic reaffirmed his refusal to participate in the E.U.\u2019s sanctions on Russia. Ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo barricaded the roads, blocking the movements of the Kosovan authorities. Protesters gathered on the Serbian side of the border, including members of the People\u2019s Patrol, the Serbian nationalist organization that has documented ties to Russia\u2019s paramilitary Wagner group. Belgrade sent its own troops to the border, threatening to step in and defend the Serbs of Kosovo. Vucic then held a meeting with a group of Kosovan Serbs, and the crisis came to an end. Needless to say, the border fracas got the attention of the European Union. In mid-March, the leaders of Serbia and Kosovo tentatively agreed to an E.U.-sponsored plan to normalize relations, but Vucic has refused to commit to anything in writing.",
      "Almost a decade ago, an American scholar and analyst named Daniel Serwer helped to arrange Vucic\u2019s first public appearance in Washington, D.C. Serwer worked in the Balkans in the 1990s and he knew all about Vucic\u2019s nationalist roots. But he was disappointed with the record of other Serbian political leaders. He told me Vucic made no promises about Kosovo, but said he would move closer to the European Union. Serwer found Vucic intelligent and serious. There was some hope, he told me, that Vucic could be a \u201cNixon in China\u201d figure, capable of bringing his party\u2019s conservative base to a fuller reconciliation with Serbia\u2019s neighbors.",
      "Serwer told me that his attitude toward Vucic has changed radically. \u201cVucic is now deadly serious about the \u2018Serbian world,\u2019\u201d he said. Those words, invoked often by Serbian nationalists, convey the idea that Serbia is entitled to dominate the lands where ethnic Serbs live, including several neighboring countries. \u201cHe had the opportunity to move in a pro-E.U. direction, and he chose not to.\u201d Serwer speculated that Vucic has concluded the reforms required to join the E.U. would weaken his hold on power or perhaps even land him in jail. That is what happened to the former prime minister of Croatia, Ivo Sanader, who presided over most of his country\u2019s preparations for accession only to be arrested and imprisoned on corruption charges (he remains in prison today). Sanader\u2019s fate has become a cautionary tale for Balkan would-be reformers.",
      "The United States and the E.U. have continued to cater to Vucic, focusing their policies on economic growth and mostly ignoring his illiberalism. The Trump administration seemed especially favorable to Vucic, openly siding with him in a regional tariff dispute and forcing the collapse of a popular government in Kosovo. Trump sent an abrasive special envoy to the region, Richard Grenell, who seemed bent on brokering a Serbia-Kosovo \u201cdeal of the century\u201d to enhance Trump\u2019s prospects in the 2020 presidential election. (It did not happen.)",
      "Serwer and a number of other Balkan experts say that the United States and the European Union are missing an opportunity to push Vucic in a more democratic direction. \u201cWe have more leverage in the western Balkans than anywhere on earth,\u201d I was told by Kurt Bassuener, a scholar who has written extensively on the Balkans. \u201cAnd yet we\u2019re building our policy on Vucic and people like him.\u201d If Vucic knew he risked losing much of his Western financial and diplomatic support, Bassuener said, his calculus might change about all kinds of things, including his habit of coddling criminals and hooligans. The notion that Serbia can \u201cbalance\u201d the West against Russia is largely a mirage, Bassuener said. Russia may be Serbia\u2019s traditional ally, but Putin, who is struggling to rebuild his own shattered army, has little of substance to offer ordinary Serbs.",
      "One afternoon in Belgrade, I spent an hour talking to Boris Tadic, who served as Serbia\u2019s president from 2004 until 2012, when he lost to Vucic\u2019s party. He told me that organized crime has become so powerful in Serbia that it is difficult to know who is calling the shots. During his own time in office, he said, he was amazed to discover that the criminal gangs \u201chad better equipment and technology than our police.\u201d The cocaine cartels had become so lucrative that they could corrupt anyone. Tadic said he had fought the mafia with some success. Vucic, he said, had \u201chelped put criminals in power\u201d with the belief that he could control them. It was a dangerous gamble.",
      "\u201cWhat is the final outcome of your power if you\u2019re going to destroy the foundations of society with hooligans and criminals?\u201d he asked. Tadic glanced uneasily around us at the hotel courtyard. \u201cWho is running this country?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaybe some companions of Belivuk are sitting next to us.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Worth is a contributing writer for the magazine and former chief of The Times\u2019s Beirut bureau whose book on the 2011 Arab Uprisings, \u201cA Rage for Order,\u201d won the 2017 Lionel Gelber prize."

      "When Stephen Foglia and his fianc\u00e9e, JoAnne Crimeni, decided it was time to leave Brooklyn and put down roots, they headed south to New Jersey. Traveling through a number of areas they couldn\u2019t afford, they came upon Freehold Township, a place they knew only from having been to the mall there.",
      "\u201cRent was getting expensive, and we wanted something that was ours, not somebody else\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Foglia, 32, a carrier for the United States Postal Service. \u201cWe were still working in New York at that time, but the closer you got to the city, the more expensive it was. So we just kept heading down and decided that Freehold was where it was at.\u201d",
      "In August 2018, the couple bought a two-bedroom condominium in the Raintree development for $235,000, and two months later they married. Now they have a daughter who is nearly 2 and a second child on the way. And Mr. Foglia and Ms. Crimeni, the recreation director at the CentraState assisted living facility in Freehold, have no plans to move.",
      "\u201cWe love it here. Everything feels like what we were used to,\u201d Mr. Foglia said. \u201cIn Manalapan and Marlboro, the people are kind of flashy, but in Freehold, they\u2019re very down-to-earth.\u201d",
      "Roslyn Sibilia, an agent with ERA Central Realty Group, said clients like the Foglias, who make their way to the township from New York, typically travel south along Route 9, discovering that \u201cby the time you get to Freehold, everything seems to open up a lot more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hub, and that\u2019s what makes it desirable,\u201d said Ms. Sibilia, 52, who moved to Freehold Township from Manalapan, N.J., in 2004. \u201cWe have great park programs for parents and kids, a lot of good school choices, the mall, a major medical center. There\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d",
      "When Chris and Amy MacDougall bought their home in Freehold in 2010, Mr. MacDougall was already familiar with the township, having moved there with his family in 2000, when he was 21. Ten years later, he and his wife bought a four-bedroom 1960 colonial in East Freehold for their own growing family, paying $350,000. The MacDougalls are now very involved with their three daughters\u2019 school and sports activities: Ms. MacDougall helps with the high school yearbook, and Mr. MacDougall coaches the girls\u2019 soccer teams.",
      "A senior claims superintendent with Admiral Insurance Group, Mr. MacDougall, 44, describes the 38-square-mile township with major highways running through it as a \u201csweet spot,\u201d both geographically and demographically: \u201cSome towns are too snooty, but you don\u2019t get that facade here. In Freehold, it\u2019s real people with real jobs and real struggles. And we fit in perfectly with that.\u201d",
      "For Elizabeth Robertson, landing in Freehold was serendipitous. After 32 years of living in North Jersey, she was looking to change her life and \u201cjust threw everything up in the air\u201d in 2005. Knowing nothing about Freehold, but wanting to be near the beach \u2014 Freehold is about 18 miles west of the shore \u2014 Ms. Robertson moved first to a townhouse in East Freehold. Five years ago, she moved again, two miles south, paying $365,000 for a four-bedroom, split-level house that she shares with her daughter and two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cWhen I came here, I had no idea what kind of town this was,\u201d said Ms. Robertson, who is now 71 and retired. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve made a lot of good friends, and my grandchildren are now doing the same thing.\u201d",
      "Freehold Township is the expansive doughnut surrounding the much smaller Freehold Borough, the historic seat of Monmouth County. With shared high schools and many shared services, the township (pop. 35,367) and the borough (pop. 12,525) are frequently seen as interchangeable, although the township is more suburban, with more spacious lots and houses mostly built in the mid to late 20th century.",
      "Route 9, a major north-south highway dotted with shopping plazas and restaurants, is considered the dividing line between East Freehold, bordering Colts Neck and Marlboro, and West Freehold, bordering Howell and Jackson. East Freehold has some of the township\u2019s larger houses, most of which have access to public water and sewer systems, and is home to Poets Corner, a development with 376 townhouses and apartments. West Freehold is closer to the township\u2019s commercial activity and is home to Raintree, a gated community with more than 1,000 townhouses, condominiums and single-family houses.",
      "Naturally, both sections have their fans. \u201cPeople who live in West Freehold think it\u2019s the greatest, and those who live in East Freehold say they would never go to West,\u201d said Melissa DeSantis, 51, a broker associate with Real Broker LLC, who has made YouTube videos on both sections of the township, as well as Freehold Borough.",
      "The township also has three 55-plus adult-living communities, a mobile-home park and a sizable stock of affordable housing, including 250 units that will remain permanently affordable, said Maureen Fasano, a member of the Township Committee and a former mayor. Freehold Raceway Mall, the state\u2019s third largest mall, sits between Routes 9 and 33. CentraState Medical Center, on West Main Street, includes a 284-bed hospital, long-term care and a wellness center.",
      "The township has numerous parks as well, including a portion of the Monmouth Battlefield State Park and the Monmouth County Fairgrounds, which contribute to the more than 9,500 acres of open space. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a big commitment to green space,\u201d Ms. Fasano said, noting that the township recently increased the added tax for open space acquisitions to $0.04 per $1,000 of a home\u2019s assessed value.",
      "Freehold is considered more affordable than many of the neighboring areas. In 2022, the average sale price of a house in the township was $624,665, down slightly from 2021\u2019s average sale price of $636,276, according to the Monmouth Ocean Regional Multiple Listing Service.",
      "As of mid-February, there were 14 single-family houses on the market, along with six condominiums or townhouses and six homes in 55-plus communities. The lowest priced single-family house was a three-bedroom 1957 raised ranch house on 0.34 acres, listed for $299,900; the highest priced was a four-bedroom 2004 house on an acre, listed for $1.289 million. The lowest priced condominium or townhouse was a two-bedroom condo listed for $319,900; the highest priced was a two-bedroom townhouse listed for $427,500 (both were in the Raintree development). As for 55-plus homes, the least expensive was a two-bedroom bungalow listed for $179,900; the most expensive was a three-bedroom house in Regent Oaks, a new Toll Brothers community near Route 9, listed for $743,995.",
      "Much of the family-oriented activity takes place in Michael J. Tighe Park, a sprawling municipal park with ball fields, picnic sites, trails, a splash park and a summer park program. The 81-acre East Freehold Showgrounds is the site of numerous horse and dog shows, as well as the annual Monmouth County Fair.",
      "For indoor entertainment, residents head to the 175-acre Freehold Raceway Mall, which has an AMC movie theater and many chain stores and restaurants, or to iPlay America, a four-acre enclosed amusement park with games and rides. For evening entertainment, residents often head to Freehold Borough, with its Victorian-era Main Street lined with ethnic and upscale restaurants, or drive to nearby shoreline communities like Asbury Park or Belmar Beach.",
      "Public school students start out at one of Freehold\u2019s five elementary schools, moving on to one of two middle schools and then, depending on where they live, to Freehold Township High School, which has almost 2,000 students, or Freehold High School in Freehold Borough, which has about 1,300.",
      "As part of the Freehold Regional High School District, the township is linked to four other high schools in the area \u2014 in Manalapan, Howell, Colts Neck and Marlboro \u2014 each of which has subject-specific magnet programs to which Freehold students can apply. The Freehold Township High School\u2019s two magnet programs are in global studies and animal and botanical science; the high school in Freehold Borough has programs in culinary arts and hospitality, as well as medical sciences.",
      "In 2021-22, average SAT scores at the high school in Freehold Borough were 583 in reading and writing and 598 in math; at Freehold Township High School, they were 568 in reading and writing and 567 in math. (State averages were 557 in reading and 560 in math.)",
      "Private school options in the area include St. Rose of Lima, a Catholic school in Freehold Borough for students in prekindergarten through eighth grade, and the Peddie School, a day and boarding school in Hightstown for students in ninth through 12th grade.",
      "Many commuters catch the New Jersey Transit No. 139 bus at the Freehold Center station in Freehold Borough; the trip to Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan takes about 70 minutes and costs $16 one way or $377 for a monthly pass. Others catch the New Jersey Transit No. 67 bus at Freehold Raceway Mall and switch at Freehold Center; by that route, the trip to Port Authority takes about 90 minutes and costs $17.60 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "The closest train station is Aberdeen-Matawan, about 12 miles north. From there, the trip to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan on a direct New Jersey Transit train takes a little over an hour and costs $14.75 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "Freehold and neighboring Manalapan Township were the site of the Battle of Monmouth, one of the biggest and most important battles of the Revolutionary War. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army, led by George Washington, intercepted British troops traveling to New York City from Philadelphia in a battle that involved 26,000 soldiers and most of the major military figures of the time, including the Marquis de Lafayette, Benedict Arnold, Anthony Wayne and Alexander Hamilton. With 600 Americans killed and 700 British casualties, both sides claimed victory.",

      "Bridgeport was once unavoidable. In the middle of the last century, the waterfront Fairfield County city 60 miles from Manhattan churned out so many kinds of products, it seemed to be almost single-handedly shaping the habits of modern life. Rolling off the assembly lines there: lipstick cases, flashlights, typewriters, fans, underwear, sewing machines, cars, scissors, guns, lace, drills, helicopters and phonograph records.",
      "But some people are only familiar with the aftermath: crumbling factories languishing along major roads and railways, an inescapable reminder of a painful loss.",
      "\u201cI told my wife, \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of Bridgeport. It\u2019s too rundown,\u2019\u201d said Andy Toledo, 43. It didn\u2019t help that a favorite TV show of his, \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d mocked the city as a place of \u201cwild dogs and gas stations without pumps.\u201d",
      "But in 2021, when Mr. Toledo and his family sought to relocate to Connecticut from their cramped condo in Mott Haven, in the Bronx, they found places like Easton and Milford too pricey, driven up by the pandemic buying spree. And Mr. Toledo soon realized that parts of Bridgeport \u2014 Connecticut\u2019s largest city, with about 148,000 residents \u2014 felt revitalized, including the North End near the Trumbull border, where the Toledos bought a new three-bedroom house in December 2021 for $390,000. Mr. Toledo shares the home with his wife, Yariliz Marquez-Toledo, 42, who works remotely for a Manhattan health clinic, and their 15-year-old son (another son is in college in Boston).",
      "Even gritty areas appear to be on the mend, although the process is happening in fits and starts. Apartments, breweries and antiques shops have popped up in some of the industrial hulks. Long-empty lots that resemble prairies are being eyed as sites for housing. And a two-year-old concert venue known as the Amp has added bounce to the city\u2019s nightlife.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is reminiscent of what happened in Mott Haven,\u201d as developers try to remake a depressed area, said Mr. Toledo, who recently left his job in New York City government to work at Bridgeport City Hall and help with the comeback. \u201cThe city\u2019s turning itself around.\u201d",
      "Making peace with the old stigma often allows buyers to find a home that feels hidden in plain sight. For two decades, Janine Sjonvall, a database manager, lived a few miles away in Fairfield. Apart from occasional trips to Bridgeport for minor-league baseball games or pizza, she didn\u2019t give it much thought. It took an online house search for her to discover what was just around the corner: an upscale Bridgeport neighborhood called Black Rock, where homes are cheaper than in Fairfield, even if property taxes are higher.",
      "A three-bedroom Dutch colonial-style house there, which cost $378,000 in 2020, is her home today. \u201cIt seems everybody is moving farther out of New York; people who used to buy in Norwalk are in Stratford,\u201d said Ms. Sjonvall, 54. \u201cI just stumbled upon this place, but I\u2019m pleased.\u201d",
      "Of course, development often leads to gentrification, which can encourage landlords to evict tenants and replace them with higher-paying ones. Already, some longtime residents are moving out, said Callie Gale Heilmann, a Bridgeport resident and a founder of the advocacy group Bridgeport Generation Now.",
      "City officials seem unwilling to attach strings to force developers to incorporate affordable housing in their projects: \u201cWe do need to grow our tax base, which has remained flat for years,\u201d Ms. Heilmann said. \u201cBut we have to ask ourselves: Who is the city for? Is it for people who have lived here their whole lives?\u201d",
      "Despite Bridgeport\u2019s large population, the 15-square-mile city is small among Connecticut\u2019s municipalities. The home lots are tiny, too, making the place feel dense.",
      "But the city is mostly houses, many in the Cape Cod-style popular around World War II, when Bridgeport was humming. The Brooklawn neighborhood comprises Capes and older colonials, and Arcadia and Hughes Avenues there are part of a well-kept pocket by the Rooster River. The tall, well-maintained 1960s condo towers along upper Park Avenue are an exception; they wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Miami Beach.",
      "In the South End, aged multifamily houses sit near former factories and student housing for the University of Bridgeport. Seaside Village, a co-op with shutter-lined brick homes built during World War I for workers at munitions factories, seems ageless.",
      "Black Rock has a similar co-op, the 36-building landmark Black Rock Gardens, on Fairfield Avenue. But Tudors, Mediterranean-style and modern homes, some quite large, are more common in this set-apart area, which residents prize for its walkability, next to Long Island Sound.",
      "On the East Side, rambling Italianates in pastel hues and showy Second Empires hug the streets around Washington Park, the onetime command central for mill owners. Citywide, more than a dozen buildings or districts are on the National Register of Historic Places.",
      "Since its industrial heyday, when Hungarians, Italians, Portuguese and immigrants from many other countries poured into the factory yards, Bridgeport has been a hub for newcomers, including a surge in the 1950s of Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Today, according to census figures, the racial makeup is 42 percent Latino, 35 percent Black, 18 percent white and 5 percent Asian.",
      "In the last five years, more than 1,500 apartments have been completed, are under construction or planned, in new and converted buildings that are mostly downtown, according to the Bridgeport Building Department. A three-building complex next to Interstate 95, in a former gramophone record factory on Cherry Street and Howard Avenue that had been abandoned for decades, is completed and occupied, with 174 apartments, market-rate and affordable.",
      "At a 104-unit brick complex at Main and Golden Hill Streets, called 1188 Lofts, the lights are now on in what had been boarded-up windows. Market-rate studios there start at $1,630 a month, and one-bedrooms at $1,865.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been sort of a diamond in the rough, but we\u2019re getting discovered,\u201d said John Guedes, the president of Primrose Companies, a developer about to cut a ribbon on a former Holiday Inn at 1070 Main Street going from 267 rooms to 94 apartments. Units will come furnished with the hotel\u2019s furniture, and one-bedrooms will start at $2,500 a month.",
      "Mr. Guedes is also constructing a 92-unit building at 1269 Main, a $22 million project, and is planning to add 112 units to an office building at 855 Main. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have affordable housing in these downtowns,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause nobody will spend money at night and they will become ghost towns.\u201d",
      "In late January, there were 78 single-family homes for sale in Bridgeport, at an average list price of $510,000, according to data from Antonio Coelho, an agent with William Pitt Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.",
      "At the high end was a five-bedroom house in Black Rock listed for $1.35 million; the least expensive was a two-bedroom in foreclosure in the Hollow neighborhood, for $156,000.",
      "There were also 41 multifamily homes listed for sale, at an average price of $442,000, Mr. Coelho said. And 26 condos were available for an average of $194,000.",
      "Deal activity appears to have come back to earth after a pandemic surge, brokers say. In 2022, 666 single-family homes sold, down from 716 in 2019, according to Sotheby\u2019s, although prices remain elevated, suggesting that demand remains robust. The 2022 average sale price was $326,000 \u2014 more than 50 percent higher than 2019\u2019s average of $210,000.",
      "\u201cIn the last couple years, Bridgeport has really gone nuts,\u201d said Mr. Coelho, who emigrated from Portugal to the Hollow in 1970 when he was 12, although he lives in nearby Shelton today. \u201cIt was little rough here in the \u201970s, but there are so many positive things going on now.\u201d",
      "Although often criticized for its crime, Bridgeport\u2019s rates appear on a par with those of other comparable cities. In 2019, there were 2,506 major crimes, including assaults, robberies and car thefts, and 17 murders, according to police statistics. In 2022, by comparison, there were 1,729 major crimes, including 15 murders, suggesting that the pandemic spike has ebbed.",
      "The poverty rate is 23 percent, below New Haven\u2019s (25 percent) and Hartford\u2019s (28 percent), but higher than Stamford\u2019s (9 percent), according to the census.",
      "Frederick Law Olmsted, known as a designer of Central Park, worked his magic on two green spaces in Bridgeport: 181-acre Beardsley Park, which contains the state\u2019s only zoo, and 375-acre Seaside Park, which offers a gentle crescent of sand. A statue of P.T. Barnum, resident, mayor and circus legend, surveys the waves with a serious expression.",
      "Boldly offbeat community radio station WPKN entertains at all hours, while Fairfield Avenue in Black Rock bustles at night. In January, Park City Music Hall hosted a Van Halen tribute band and an act called Beatniks Organ Trio. Total Mortgage Arena offers hockey games and concerts, and the Amp next door \u2014 officially, the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater, a 5,700-seat conversion of a former baseball stadium \u2014 hosts bands.",
      "Steelpointe, a waterfront project planned for years, doesn\u2019t have a lot to show for itself yet, but the lighthouse-themed restaurant Boca Mediterranean Oyster Bar offers marina views.",
      "And Mongers Market, which sells items salvaged from factories inside a former screwdriver and piano factory, has been pulling in large crowds for the last few years.",
      "Bridgeport\u2019s school district, which had 39 schools and programs for about 19,000 students in the 2021-22 school year, has not been among the state\u2019s best, but perhaps is not as troubled as some think.",
      "On the state\u2019s 2022 Smarter Balanced assessment exams, given to students in third through eighth grade, 60.5 percent met standards in English, compared with 60.4 percent statewide, and 57 percent met standards in math, compared with 65 percent statewide. (Stamford, a nearby city with a 16,000-student district, didn\u2019t fare much differently: 57 percent of students met standards in English and 58 percent met standards in math.)",
      "Overall, 65 percent of Bridgeport\u2019s students are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, while the statewide figure is 41 percent. Bridgeport\u2019s six high schools have a four-year graduation rate of 76 percent, versus Connecticut\u2019s 90 percent overall rate.",
      "School officials say Bridgeport\u2019s system is chronically underfunded. Last year, spending there was $16,439 a student; in contrast, Stamford spent $19,625, according to state data.",
      "Bridgeport has a major stop on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven train line, from which 10 trains depart for Grand Central on weekdays between 6 and 8 a.m. The shortest trip takes an hour and 21 minutes; the longest takes an hour and 45 minutes. A monthly pass is about $384. The stop, downtown on Water Street, also offers Amtrak service.",
      "The Greater Bridgeport Transit bus system also offers service along more than a dozen routes within the city and beyond it.",
      "Bridgeport has enjoyed ferry service to Long Island since 1872, when crops were hauled to the city\u2019s factories. In the winter, boats carrying cars depart 10 times a day for Port Jefferson, a trip that takes an hour and 15 minutes. The fee for most vehicles is $68.",
      "Employees of a major pie bakery on Kossuth Street once passed the time in the parking lot by throwing empty pie tins back and forth. The pastime, at William Frisbie\u2019s bakery, soon became a hit with local children, according to the ",
      " at the Bridgeport Public Library, and the children turned it into a sport. Yalies in New Haven followed suit, calling the game \u201cFrisbie.\u201d In the 1950s, Wham-O, a California company, made plastic versions of the tins and tweaked the name slightly, producing the Frisbee.",

      "Hai Yang, 37, lives in a one-bedroom apartment overlooking the Byram River in downtown Port Chester, a 2.4-square-mile village in the town of Rye, in Westchester County. Since moving to the $2,700-a-month apartment a year ago, Mr. Yang has found he can walk to most everything he needs.",
      "The Metro-North train station is a three-minute walk, which makes it easy to head into New York City to visit friends. Happy hour deals and live jazz are right next door, at the Saltaire Oyster Bar. And he doesn\u2019t need a car to hit the local gym.",
      "But Mr. Yang does have a car, so he can commute to his job in Danbury, Conn., where he is an engineering manager in the medical device industry. Finding a place to park in Port Chester is not an issue \u2014 particularly compared to his experience in downtown White Plains, N.Y., where he used to live. And the village, in general, is \u201cmuch less congested,\u201d he said.",
      "Deirdre Curran, 57, moved into a townhouse across from the village\u2019s 20-acre Lyon Park last June. A retired pet sitter and dog walker, Ms. Curran had rented in the village off and on over the years, and appreciates its diversity. \u201cThere are a lot of different cultures, and you can get any kind of food you want from Central and South America,\u201d she said.",
      "She paid $515,000 for her two-bedroom home, which is convenient to downtown businesses, major highways and the Westchester County Airport. But while Ms. Curran loves her home\u2019s location, she is increasingly alarmed by the scale and pace of residential development planned for the compact downtown area.",

      "\u201cThey want to do all this major development in this tiny little village that does not have the infrastructure to handle it,\u201d Ms. Curran said. \u201cIt seems to me like an awful lot of major development in a very short period of time.\u201d",
      "The village has granted conditional site plan approval to projects with a total of more than 2,800 units over the past three years, said Stuart L. Rabin, the village manager. This flurry of development proposals is largely the result of a change in village zoning three years ago designed to encourage the redevelopment and revitalization of Port Chester\u2019s downtown, waterfront and transit-adjacent parcels, he said.",
      "\u201cThe village of Port Chester is certainly on the move,\u201d Mr. Rabin said.",
      "But the scale of the proposals has generated considerable public pushback, with some residents expressing concern that towering apartment buildings threaten to overwhelm the historic downtown and price out the many mom-and-pop businesses.",
      "John Allen, an elected member of Port Chester\u2019s board of trustees, said that while the village was \u201cripe for redevelopment,\u201d given the number of buildings in disrepair, there is a growing sense that the board allowed for \u201cthese extraordinary increases for density and asked for very little in return from developers,\u201d including having to meet more of the community\u2019s affordable housing needs.",
      "The board has recently begun to discuss a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d moratorium on development in order to study whether further changes are needed to the zoning code, he said. A moratorium would not affect projects already under construction.",
      "Port Chester is a densely developed village of 31,000 that \u201csprang to life at the crossroads of various transportation options,\u201d including a small harbor on Long Island Sound and rail lines into New York City, said Gregg Hamilton, a retired Manhattan transplant who runs the ",

      "Some remnants of its 19th- and early 20th-century industrial heyday remain. The Simons Manufacturing Company building, which once housed a major textile maker, is now a loft-style office complex. And the former headquarters of the Life Savers Candy Company now houses condominiums.",
      "In the walkable downtown area, beauty salons, restaurants and grocery stores catering to the village\u2019s majority-Hispanic population line the main thoroughfares of Westchester Avenue and North and South Main. (According to census data, the village population is 64 percent Hispanic, 28 percent white, 5 percent Black and 1 percent Asian.) Two large commercial bakeries \u2014 Neri\u2019s and J.J. Cassone \u2014 are major employers.",
      "Modest single-family and multifamily homes set close to the hilly streets surround the downtown. To the north, the streets are wider, and homes are set farther apart in suburban-style neighborhoods.",
      "A 15-acre abandoned hospital campus on the edge of downtown, ",
      ", is now set for redevelopment by Rose Associates and BedRock Real Estate Partners. The companies have received site plan approval for nearly 1,000 housing units, including 200 age-restricted units, and expect to begin demolition of the existing buildings by spring, said Richard Shea, a project spokesman.",
      "The nonprofit Carver Center supports the community\u2019s lower-income and immigrant populations with a food bank, citizenship classes, after-school programming and a teen center.",
      "As in most of Westchester County, housing inventory in Port Chester is very low and it is a seller\u2019s market, said Thomas E. Consaga, the broker-owner at Re/Max Ace Realty. Competition is particularly high among first-time buyers because home prices are considerably lower than in surrounding suburbs like Greenwich, Conn., and Rye, N.Y., he said.",
      "The median sale price for a single-family home in Port Chester last year was $645,000, almost 10 percent higher than in 2021. By comparison, the 2022 ",
      " in neighboring Greenwich was almost $3 million.",
      "As of last week, there were only about 20 single-family homes on the market, Mr. Consaga said. They ranged from a three-bedroom colonial built in 1955, listed for $475,000, to a six-bedroom colonial built in 1900, listed for $1.34 million.",
      "The median sale price for a condominium last year was $347,500; for a cooperative, it was $118,000, he said.",
      "Almost 60 percent of households in Port Chester are renter-occupied, according to census data. Over the last 12 months, the median rent for a two-bedroom was $2,800, Mr. Consaga said.",
      "That figure factors in the many older, multifamily homes in the village, but rents at the new apartment buildings are considerably higher. At Port & Main, which has a rooftop terrace and a fitness center, a 400-square-foot studio starts at $2,300 a month and an 1,150-square-foot, two-bedroom rents for more than $4,000, said Whitney Okun, who runs a development group at Houlihan Lawrence that is overseeing the project.",
      "The Capitol Theater, on Westchester Avenue, books big-name artists that draw music lovers from throughout the region. Concertgoers swarm the wide array of downtown restaurants, including El Tio, Bartaco, T&J Restaurant and Pizzeria, and Panka Peruvian Bistro.",
      "The parking lot at the Waterfront at Port Chester mall is jammed on weekends with shoppers stocking up at Costco. The mall\u2019s other draw is a 14-screen AMC movie theater.",
      "The growing arts scene includes the well-established Clay Art Center, a large complex with numerous pottery studios and classrooms, as well as a public gallery, and Ice Cream Social, a relatively new space where artists working in various media can rent private or shared studios.",
      "\u201cPort Chester is my hometown, so it\u2019s kind of a dream to be able to support the artists who are here,\u201d said Jennifer Cacciola, an artist and a founder of the center, who moved to Connecticut from Brooklyn shortly before the pandemic.",
      "The Port Chester-Rye Union Free School District serves students in all of Port Chester and about a third of the neighboring village of Rye Brook. Of the roughly 4,500 students districtwide, about 83 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino, 12 percent as white, 3 percent as Black and 2 percent as Asian, according to state education data.",
      "The district contracts with Corpus Christi Holy Rosary School to provide a prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds. Students in kindergarten through fifth grade attend one of four elementary schools; those in sixth through eighth grade attend Port Chester Middle School.",
      "Port Chester High School is on a 20-acre campus bordering Rye Brook, with about 1,600 students. Academic offerings include Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses. The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2022 was 88 percent.",
      "Port Chester station, on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven line, is in the heart of downtown. The ride to Grand Central during peak commuting times takes just under an hour; the one-way fare is $13.75, and a monthly pass is $270.",

As the factories closed, more immigrants from throughout Central and South America settled in the working-class village, opening restaurants and servicing the affluent suburbs as landscapers, day laborers, house cleaners and child-care providers. The population growth hasn\u2019t been without tensions: In 2009, a federal judge ordered the village to adopt a new voting system that would give the Hispanic and Latino population a fairer opportunity to elect one of their own to the board of trustees.

You also could band with your neighbors and form a tenants\u2019 association to \u201ccommence a legal proceeding to obtain a court order to force the landlord to fix the problem,\u201d he said.

As of last week, only about 17 rentals were available, some of them seasonal. \u201cI put one on for $2,100 a month recently, and we had swarms of people,\u201d Ms. Poola said. \u201cYou feel bad \u2014 the market is just so constricted.\u201d",
      "Downtown Niantic is the heart of the community. The stretch of Main Street along Niantic Bay draws locals and visitors alike to boutiques, shops, small restaurants and the Niantic Children\u2019s Museum. Across Main Street, on the bay, are a mile-long boardwalk, McCook Point Park and Hole-in-the-Wall Beach, which takes its name from the short tunnel beneath the railroad tracks used to reach the beach.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a beach town, but it\u2019s not like Watch Hill or Nantucket \u2014 it\u2019s very relaxed,\u201d Ms. Poola said, referring to pricier, better-known areas in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. \u201cYou can come off the beach, pull your hair back in a scrunchie and go to a restaurant downtown.\u201d",

    "name": "How to Grow Dahlias? A Ceramist Has Some Advice for You",
    "author": "New York Times",

      "It\u2019s time to unpack the dahlias, and Frances Palmer finds herself surrounded by 25 sizable cardboard cartons full of tubers that she dug up and then stored last fall in the frost-proof cellar of her barn.",
      "To complete the coals-to-Newcastle scene: Several boxes of new tubers she ordered have just arrived, too. Who could have resisted ordering them, even when already in possession of a massive overwintered inventory?",
      "Not ",
      ", a ceramist based in Weston, Conn., whose art and garden have intertwined and grown together over three decades. Each has informed the other, taking on a bit of its shape and character.",
      "Dahlias to the max \u2014 apparently there can be no such thing as too many dahlias. As she put it, \u201cThey\u2019re just so joyous.\u201d",
      "The products of her two forms of self-expression have posed for many portraits together, as Ms. Palmer, 66, has cultivated a third creative pursuit: photography. The images fill her popular ",
      " and her 2020 book, \u201cLife in the Studio: Inspiration and Lessons on Creativity.\u201d",
      "Ms. Palmer\u2019s ceramics are highly distinctive, but entirely functional. These vases, dinnerware and serving pieces are meant to be sold, and used. From the start, she wanted to document her designs, and realized she could lend a sense of scale by working in some props. Like flowers in the vases.",
      "\u201cThat was really my impetus to start gardening,\u201d she said. Once she did, no flower tugged at her harder than the dahlia.",
      "In her connection to them, Ms. Palmer is in good company among creative women, including Frida Kahlo (who grew them in her garden in Mexico, where dahlias are native, and was frequently pictured wearing them like a crown). Vanessa Bell, a member of the Bloomsbury Group, grew and painted dahlias at Charleston farmhouse in East Sussex, England, and a memorable photograph of the contemporary Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama as a child shows her holding four giant ones.",
      "That\u2019s no surprise, really, considering the flowers\u2019 vivid color palette, sculptural geometry (the shapes include preposterous pompons and balls as well as spiky cactus-like blooms) and size (from less than two inches to almost a foot across).",
      "Although she won\u2019t put a number on it, Ms. Palmer acknowledges growing \u201chundreds\u201d of dahlia plants a season, each given just enough real estate to accommodate the tomato cage supporting it. The goal: an abundant flower harvest.",
      "\u201cBecause my garden functions as a cutting garden, I just use the tomato cages, and they go cheek by jowl,\u201d she said.",
      "The plants fill two large, fenced garden areas: four 16-by-16-foot beds in one space and 30 raised beds of four-by-eight feet or longer atop an old tennis court, where she also keeps several beehives.",
      "And it\u2019s not just dahlias she grows to cut.",
      "\u201cI have all sorts of things happening,\u201d she said, ticking off a flowering cascade from spring bulbs to sweet peas, annual poppies and natives like asters and ironweed (Vernonia) that peak simultaneously with the dahlias. \u201cBut the dahlias always get the best \u2014 and the most \u2014 real estate, and everything else gets pushed in between. It\u2019s quite chaotic.\u201d",
      "Visitors to her annual Garden Conservancy Open Day (this year, it\u2019s ",
      ") don\u2019t seem to mind.",
      "Everything appears in delightful excess, unfolding toward \u201ca great crescendo in the garden,\u201d from the time the dahlias get going, by mid-July or so, right through till frost says stop and those cardboard boxes get loaded up again.",
      "Most of us will never try growing \u201chundreds\u201d of dahlias \u2014 even over many seasons. There are almost 11,000 named dahlias on the American Dahlia Society\u2019s composite list of varieties, from 1976 to the present; international groups list even more. The largest source in the United States, Swan Island Dahlias, carries more than 400.",
      "So which ones should we seek out?",
      "It\u2019s a topic that Ms. Palmer, who also recommends Ferncliff Gardens, Old House Gardens and Queen Valley Farm as sources, covers with students at the New York Botanical Garden in the Dauntless Dahlias course she has taught every March and October since 2015.",
      "\u201cThink abstractly versus specifically,\u201d she advises. Consider which colors, shapes and forms you prefer \u2014 and what scale.",
      "Don\u2019t obsess over the names of the dahlias, because if you can\u2019t find them, it\u2019s really irrelevant,\u201d she tells her students as she projects images of outstanding examples. \u201cYou can find something that looks kind of along the same lines. If you want a pink cactus dahlia, it doesn\u2019t have to be the particular one that I\u2019m showing you.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have favorites. Pressed to name names, she does: yellow, peony-shaped Meadowburn Old Tweet, for instance, and Juanita, a six-inch-across cactus type in rich red. Also Cafe au Lait, the palest peach or barely pink, which is often used in weddings.",
      "Some are extra-flashy, like Bodacious (big, bright orange petals with yellow undersides), Myrtle\u2019s Brandy (distinctive, reflexed red petals with white tips) and Deuil du Roi Albert (purple tipped in white). Bishop of Llandaff has screaming, semidouble scarlet flowers and dark purple foliage.",
      "The list goes on. She always makes room for flowers of velvety black-red (maybe giant Spartacus or smaller Paul Smith) and \u201ca good orange\u201d (Clyde\u2019s Choice can reach a foot across). Pink (perhaps the massive Otto\u2019s Thrill) and white (Walter Hardisty, another big guy) are also musts. At least one color \u2014 yellow, which she once disliked \u2014 has grown on her thanks to her relationship with dahlias.",
      "In each hue, she said, she seeks a range of shapes and sometimes shades, \u201cso that when I\u2019m putting them together in arrangement, you\u2019ve got some nice diversity of form and color and size. If you have a little bit of everything, it\u2019s so easy to put together something that looks abundant.\u201d",
      "Homegrown zinnias and marigolds are among the other ingredients in that abundance; so are copper fennel, nasturtiums and even strands of clematis vine.",
      "One simplifying tactic she suggests if you want get started: Shop according to a color or shape theme.",
      "\u201cIf you like yellow, just get yellow dahlias that are pompons or decorative or cactus,\u201d she said, \u201cso that you have a variation of shape and form. Even if you decided to just do ball dahlias one year, and only had all different colors or sizes of ball dahlias, you would have a fabulous garden.\u201d",
      "Except in Zones 8 to 10, where they are perennials, dahlias tubers are planted outside like annuals, around tomato-transplant time. Ms. Palmer plants hers in mid-May, around Mother\u2019s Day.",
      "There is no room in a greenhouse or under lights to pot up all of those overwintered tubers for a head start, but new mail-order purchases tend to arrive well before it\u2019s safe to put them outdoors and may dry out if left in their boxes. She pots those up, or at least stashes them in a tray of potting soil.",
      "In May, each tomato cage from her giant collection is called into service, gridded out in the gardens along with a stake or two to reinforce it. Beneath each one, a tuber is planted so that an inch or two of soil covers it. A tag marked with the dahlia\u2019s name is tied onto the cage.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing about planting a dahlia tuber is getting your support system in place immediately,\u201d Ms. Palmer said. As the plants grow, she uses biodegradable jute twine for further support, and maybe another stake for the tallest ones. Where cages may look out of place, you can use just bamboo stakes and twine.",
      "Also important: When the first stem pushes up six to 12 inches high, Ms. Palmer pinches the center bud to promote bushiness.",
      "A second pinch, or disbudding, can encourage long stems for cutting. As the plants get ready to produce flowers later on, they form three buds at the end of each branch; pinch off the outer two in each group. Ms. Palmer repeats this as the plants continue to set flowers.",
      "Every couple of weeks throughout the summer, she dilutes fish emulsion with water in a two-gallon sprayer, and \u201cthe roses, the tomatoes, the dahlias \u2014 everybody gets a spray, all over the garden,\u201d she said.",
      "And on they grow, until the first frost. Ideally, Ms. Palmer waits till a week or two after it blackens the plants, and then cuts them back and digs them out. But sometimes frost comes so late she has to dig before it arrives.",
      "She brushes off clods of soil and spreads the tubers out to cure in the barn for a week or so. Then she cuts the stems to maybe two or three inches long, packs the tubers into her cartons with a wood-shaving material from the farm store labeled as horse bedding, and back they go into the cellar.",
      "Oh, but wait: There\u2019s one more step. Don\u2019t forget to tie the tag on the tuber\u2019s stem before you put it away \u2014 if you can keep the exhumed darlings straight, that is.",
      "\u201cAnd I do try,\u201d Ms. Palmer said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a Kafkaesque exercise to tag the tubers with names after I cure them. Thankfully, I don\u2019t really care at the end of the day.\u201d",

      "Once they had unpacked, they noticed one big problem right away, beyond the poor insulation and the possums living in the roof: The primary living spaces in the back of the house and the backyard were dark, while the front of the house got sun all day long.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to have a lot of light, and in Australia that means a lot of northern sun,\u201d Mr. Calleja said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got street frontage on the north and want to have all your windows there, you have privacy concerns.\u201d",
      "Creating an internal courtyard was one possible solution. Searching online, the couple found ",
      ", a Melbourne-based architecture studio that had recently designed a striking courtyard house nearby.",
      "When Adi Atic and Michael Artemenko, the founders of FIGR, visited the 0.16-acre lot, they agreed that building a house with a courtyard would help. But they also thought they could do better than simply replace the old house with a new one. Looking at how the backyard was hemmed in by other houses, Mr. Artemenko said, the architects asked themselves: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we flip this on its head and do the front yard as the backyard?\u201d",
      "By pushing the new house as far back as the lot-line setback requirement would allow, they could create a more generous, light-filled yard in front. But privacy would still be an issue, and neither the owners nor their architects wanted to put up a big fence.",
      "That\u2019s when Mr. Atic and Mr. Artemenko remembered learning about the concept of a ha-ha in architecture school: a sunken fence used in 18th-century landscapes that was concealed from view. \u201cBasically, it looks like a ditch, and it prevented livestock from going in the garden area,\u201d Mr. Atic said.",
      "The architects turned this idea on its head, too: Rather than digging a ditch, they would build a landscaped earthen mound near the sidewalk, blocking sightlines from the street and creating a garden-like feeling in the yard.",
      "For the house, they designed a 2,750-square-foot, single-story structure that runs in a circle around a central courtyard and oversized glass doors that open entire walls to the outdoors. For cladding, they chose slender white brick and charred silvertop ash that run from the exterior into interior rooms, reinforcing the sense of indoor-outdoor living.",
      "Once the plans were set, the family moved into a rental down the street as demolition of the old house and construction of the new one began in July 2020. They had already ordered most of their building materials at the beginning of the pandemic, before supply-chain issues snarled other construction projects, so their new home was complete in November 2021 at a cost of about 1.5 million Australian dollars (about $990,000).",
      "The kitchen, dining area and living room are at the front of the house, taking advantage of the northern light and views of the expanded front garden. In the middle of the house are two bedrooms for the children on one side of the courtyard and a home office on the other. The primary bedroom is at the back, along with an additional sitting room and a gym; all have views of the rear garden, where the old backyard used to be.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in this property, you feel very secluded; you feel like you\u2019re in the country,\u201d Mr. Atic said. \u201cYou see greenery everywhere, even though you\u2019re five minutes from the city.\u201d",
      "The windows around the courtyard help the family stay connected. \u201cWe can see the kids from the kitchen, through the courtyard,\u201d Ms. Suemag said, so they don\u2019t need to call out to find each other. \u201cThat\u2019s probably my favorite thing.\u201d",
      "The reimagined front yard has also been embraced by the family \u2014 including their golden Labrador, Mellow, who keeps her distance from the earthen mound. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t climb the ha-ha,\u201d Mr. Calleja said. \u201cShe did once, when it was being constructed, but we arranged the boulders so she couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Much like the 18th-century ha-ha that kept farm animals where they were supposed to be, this 21st-century version has proved useful for restraining an urban pet. \u201cIt does the job,\u201d Mr. Calleja said.",

      "It\u2019s No Mow May, time for the annual campaign that advocates just what it says: Skip mowing the lawn this month, in the name of providing additional resources for early-season pollinators.",
      "I take a slightly different approach. One day during the first week of May is the only time all year that I actually do mow several increasingly large swaths of my property.",
      "My philosophy? No Mow 364 Days, I guess you could say.",
      "I started growing my first little meadow about 30 years ago, and since then I have stopped cutting a few other areas, too, except for that one day a year.",
      "In each space, new species keep showing up. They\u2019re not all desirable, admittedly, as I have made very clear repeatedly, in rude language, to the brambles encroaching on the oldest, largest area. They fight back in their own way, their thorns drawing blood. Mine.",
      "Woody invaders and all, these wilder portions of my place have been the site of a decades-long continuing-education course in the early stages of ecological succession \u2014 and a four-season delight to me and a diversity of wildlife.",
      "I just wish I\u2019d had an operator\u2019s manual when I started. Two recently published books can provide that for gardeners who are rethinking their landscapes, by helping them maintain realistic expectations while they\u2019re transitioning to a wilder style \u2014 and facing what can sometimes feel like spontaneity incarnate.",
      "\u201cEvery lawn is a prairie screaming to come out of the ground,\u201d said Benjamin Vogt, the Nebraska-based designer who owns ",
      ", when he joined me on ",
      " not long ago to talk about his 2023 book, \u201cPrairie Up: An Introduction to Natural Garden Design.\u201d",
      "\u201cNature wants to be diverse and abundant,\u201d echoed Owen Wormser, of ",
      ", on ",
      " coinciding with the release of the updated edition of his 2020 \u201cLawns Into Meadows: Growing a Regenerative Landscape.\u201d \u201cUltimately, plants just show up.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs caretakers, we have the ability to steer this to some degree,\u201d added Mr. Wormser, who is based in Western Massachusetts. \u201cBut the idea is to also let the plants and the site and nature steer it, as well. It\u2019s a collaboration.\u201d",
      "Both books guide us through planning, site preparation and aftercare. They also stress what may be the most important lesson of all: You need to cultivate patience as intently as you cultivate your looser new patch of ground \u2014 lots of it. Just as your planting style will be more relaxed, your mind-set around tidiness, order and timing must ease up, too.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re letting plants guide the way, guide the management, show us where they want to be and how they want to be,\u201d Mr. Vogt told me. \u201cAnd even if they want to vanish completely \u2014 and that\u2019s totally OK \u2014 we like that dynamic in the landscape. We want to see things changing.\u201d",
      "As Mr. Wormser writes, \u201cPart of establishing a meadow is also a lesson in letting go. Basic maintenance aside, once you\u2019ve designed and planted your meadow, your primary job is to give it the space and time it needs to reveal its own character.\u201d",
      "I garden in a rural area, and my home landscape sits on a remnant of an orchard and pasture that were there long before I arrived. Years ago, examining a grassy area uphill from my house, I was encouraged by the presence of a few key native plants I recognized. Thinking they would make good meadow ingredients, I simply stopped mowing and watched what happened.",
      "My only mowing is timed for early May, because one plant I identified in the mix was little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), a grass that is a warm-season grower. It emerges slightly later than most of the nonnative, cool-season pasture grasses around it. By mowing after those less-desirable species have sprouted but just before the bluestem arises, I knock them back, giving it the edge.",
      "In a conventional turf-grass lawn in the suburbs, this practice that I call \u201cunmowing\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t work. A meadow-style design \u2014 or one inspired by other grassland communities like prairie or savanna \u2014 would have to be intentionally planted.",
      "Choosing plants based on their looks or your hardiness zone isn\u2019t enough, both authors stress. You must identify regionally (or even better, locally) appropriate natives that match your particular site conditions.",
      "\u201cZone 5 in New York State is not the same as Zone 5 in Colorado, particularly when working with native plants,\u201d Mr. Vogt writes. The minimum winter temperatures may be similar, but the climates and plant communities are not.",
      "Rather than using the Department of Agriculture\u2019s hardiness zone maps, he starts with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ",
      ", to learn more about the greater ecosystem a property lies within.",
      "Next, he turns to native-plant search tools and guides on websites like ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " or ",
      " that offer lists of regional natives. Not all of them will be suited to your design concept, precise location or site conditions, though, so that\u2019s when the homework really begins.",
      "Narrow the possibilities by reading up on each plant, Mr. Vogt advised. A regional field guide to natives is another good tool. Your state or local native-plant society will have valuable resources to explore, too.",
      "Maybe no plant choices are more important than which grasses to use.",
      "\u201cSince grasses ground a meadow visually and are the dominant plants, choose them first,\u201d Mr. Wormser writes. He typically incorporates one or two clump-forming, warm-season grasses into a small-scale design (or up to four in a large project), which form \u201cthe backbone of my meadows.\u201d",
      "Another consideration in refining your palette: To create nature-inspired designs, Mr. Vogt suggests thinking in layers, the way nature\u2019s plant communities are structured. That means employing plants of various scales, from ground covers like sedges (Carex) and structural ones that fill the middle level, like mountain mint (Pycnanthemum virginianum), to taller, architectural types, like ironweed (Vernonia).",
      "He also recommends selecting for layers of seasonality \u2014 striving for continued visual appeal and sustained support for beneficial insects, birds and other wildlife.",
      "\u201cA natural garden has several plants at each layer,\u201d he writes, \u201cas well as plants doing their thing at different times of year.\u201d",
      "So far, my own \u201cbed preparation\u201d in each experiment has been nothing more than deciding what shape to leave unmown. But most gardeners will need to prepare their sites for planting, and both books lay out the options.",
      "A site that has been cleared of vegetation is usually the ideal starting point, they agree. But how best to get there: with repeated tillings over many months or an application of ",
      "? Or perhaps via the seemingly instant gratification of a rented sod stripper\u2019s mechanical handiwork? Or maybe you could use cardboard to ",
      " the underlying vegetation with plastic sheeting?",
      "There are ethical considerations \u2014 and practical ones. For instance, although stripping the sod allows you to plant the same day, the weed seeds in the underlying soil will germinate once they have been exposed to light. A late-summer or early-fall herbicide application may go against the organic gardener\u2019s grain, but the dead lawn that results makes a good base to sow seed into, without the tilling that could uncover those weed seeds.",
      "Whether to sow seed, plant landscape plugs or use a mixture of both is another decision that has to be made. Cost is a factor, and so is time \u2014 and time may be the biggest point of reckoning.",
      "A completely seed-sown meadow can take four or more years to come together, Mr. Vogt said. If you\u2019re using all plugs, it takes two to three years; with a mixture of the two, it takes about four.",
      "In the meantime, a nurse crop \u2014 often an annual grass like rye or other annuals \u201cfor first-year green and color,\u201d he writes \u2014 can help visually, and will limit weeds while the seed-sown perennials take hold. But it won\u2019t be the \u201cafter\u201d picture you had in mind. Not yet.",
      "That\u2019s why he has his clients sign what he calls \u201can expectations agreement\u201d before beginning a project: He wants them to acknowledge that some growing pains lie ahead, and that there is no point of fixity when it will be \u201call done.\u201d",
      "Change has surely been the one constant in my meadow experience. I now count five species of goldenrod (Solidago) \u2014 where did they all come from? What about the invasion of weeds, including that thorny Rubus? Do I pull or dig them up, risking soil disturbance that might unearth who knows what? My once-yearly mowing no longer subdues the brambles as it did years ago.",
      "\u201cA lot of this is experimentation, and really just seeing what happens,\u201d Mr. Wormser told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re skeptical about something like pulling blackberries, maybe just pull one and see what happens in a month or two.\u201d",
      "What is most reassuring about these new guidebooks is that neither author, despite his considerable depth of experience, pretends to have all the answers. Bigger forces are at work, as anyone ready to skip mowing 364 days a year will come to understand. This is a different kind of gardening.",
      "\u201cYou can plan for every contingency with your site prep and design,\u201d Mr. Wormser writes, \u201cbut nature will have the last word.\u201d",

      "Since the days of the gold rush, dreamers hoping to strike it rich have been staking their claim to a dusty 80-acre town in the Mojave Desert called Nipton. For nearly all of them, those dreams have been fool\u2019s gold.",
      "A buyer who envisioned turning the California ghost town into a testing ground for solar power died before getting his green energy idea off the ground. An attempt by a cannabis company to create a weed-themed resort was impeded by legislation that banned marijuana sales there.",
      "Ross Mollison is the most recent badlands baron. His company, Spiegelworld, bought the town on a whim last year for $2.5 million \u2014 a million or so shy of what he paid for his six-bed, five-bath apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn.",
      "As the founder of Spiegelworld, a live entertainment company producing sybaritic adult circuses in Las Vegas, Mr. Mollison specializes in spectacle and calls himself an \u201cImpresario Extraordinaire.\u201d But even hedonists must occasionally fast. In the desert sun of Nipton, where visitors now can find little beyond a peeling one-room schoolhouse, an empty general store, a five-bed hotel and a small cluster of forgotten cabins, he is trying to build an oasis of escape \u2014 a circus sanctuary.",
      "This unincorporated town, with no local government and a penchant for attracting homesteaders who prefer to stay off the grid, can become a retreat for circus performers to workshop new acts and a luxury attraction for tourists who could stop there on the way to Las Vegas, Mr. Mollison said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not approaching it like a developer. I want Nipton to look like it does now, but more beautified, with a globally significant, interesting restaurant that is somewhere between Francis Mallmann and the French Laundry,\u201d he said, referencing well-known restaurateurs as he described plans for multiple eateries, a hotel, solar panels and a runway for small planes, all with a big top twist. \u201cMaybe we stick a trapeze in the middle, or a high wire that\u2019s 1,000 feet off the ground. Or is that too P.T. Barnum?\u201d",
      "The resurrection plan has not gone unnoticed by the town\u2019s handful of locals, who have watched men like Mr. Mollison come and go. Like his circus attractions, Mr. Mollison is a bit of a curiosity. He has a fondness for foul language, especially the word that begins with the letter F. He is unabashed about his taste for the refined, and his distaste for the conventional. His employees say he pushes them to constantly go weirder and wilder in their thinking, and is often willing to make huge investments of both time and money to see how that thinking plays out.",
      "\u201cMy first week on the job, we had coffee, and he said, \u2018Look, I want to hear every stupid idea you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d said David Anthony, general manager of \u201cAtomic Saloon Show,\u201d a Spiegelworld production at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. \u201cOf all the people I know who would have bought a town, Ross makes sense.\u201d",
      "Mr. Mollison grew up in Melbourne, Australia, and Nipton\u2019s topography \u2014 studded with eucalyptus, a tree mostly native to the Land Down Under \u2014 reminds him of home. \u201cIt smells like Australia,\u201d he said.",
      "Perhaps the man is meeting the town. There is only one paved road, and little aside from sand, shrubs and cholla cactuses for miles. The Union Pacific railroad train regularly barrels down the tracks that border the town, its whistle splitting the air. The nearest hospital is an hour away; to send or pick up mail, residents must drive to post office boxes across the Nevada border. Without taxation for city management services, fire and police support, while technically available from other nearby towns in San Bernardino county, can be spotty.",
      "It takes a certain kind of person to live so remotely. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small town,\u201d said Alex Strebel, who along with her husband, Frank, was tapped as Nipton\u2019s caretaker shortly after Spiegelworld\u2019s purchase. \u201cIf you sneeze when you\u2019re driving by, you\u2019re going to miss it.\u201d",
      "Nipton currently has fewer than two dozen residents, primarily clustered in a small RV park. Most are seasonal miners who stay for a few months at a time and keep to themselves; others, like Jim Eslinger, have lived there since 2009 and are offering themselves as informal partners to Spiegelworld.",
      "\u201cThis is my idea of paradise out here,\u201d said Mr. Eslinger, 66, a former long-haul trucker who grew up in Washington State and came to Nipton in 2009 after 18 years on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s like Hotel California \u2014 I checked in and I never plan to leave.\u201d",
      "He refers to himself as Nipton\u2019s Mayor Jim. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see what Spiegelworld has in store, and to help them make their dreams come true. I don\u2019t care, I just enjoy living out here.\u201d",
      "Nathan Will, 30, an industrial construction worker from Plain City, Ohio, came to Nipton last January to take a job at the nearby rare earth mineral mines. His wife and 1.5-year-old son are waiting for him back home, and nights in his camper with his two dogs, Max and Honey, can be quiet.",
      "When Spiegelworld first took over, he wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.",
      "\u201cAt first, I was just thinking, what does a circus want with an old town in the middle of nowhere?\u201d Mr. Will said. \u201cThe first time they brought all the performers out here, in their outfits and costumes, it was a culture shock. But it\u2019s gotten cleaner and more dependable, and you have someone here if something goes wrong.\u201d",
      "Mr. Mollison said he has made it a priority to include the local residents in his plans for Nipton, and in a smattering of small events that Spiegelworld has held on the grounds so far, he has made sure to invite them.",
      "In late February, Mr. Mollison decided to give a party in Nipton. Two dozen Spiegelworld performers and employees drove in from Las Vegas. And as they gathered in Nipton\u2019s abandoned saloon for a festive sukiyaki dinner, inspired by a hot pot soup Mr. Mollison had recently enjoyed in Japan, Mr. Will and Mr. Eslinger were guests at the table.",
      "\u201cMy biggest hope for Nipton is you don\u2019t forget what makes us special,\u201d Mr. Will said, raising a beer in a toast while everyone else sipped sake cocktails. \u201cFamily comes from a lot of places other than blood, so if Nipton keeps this, sticking together with the people, it will thrive.\u201d",
      "First a gold rush outpost in the early 1900s, Nipton later served as a bolt-hole for silent film stars looking for a respite from Hollywood, and even the setting for a postapocalyptic video game. But after the gold rush stalled and the mining industry declined, Nipton\u2019s appeal, rooted largely in having a general store and a rail station, faded. The boomtown went bust by the middle of the 20th century.",
      "Nipton\u2019s latest chapter begins in the 1980s, when Gerald Freeman, a gold miner eager to make the shift to renewable energy, purchased the town. After decades of disuse, it was largely abandoned. He fixed up its store and cafe into an old-timey destination for tourists seeking a taste of the American West and ",
      " amid the yucca and gum trees.",
      "But he was only about halfway to that goal when he died in 2016. His wife, Jennifer Lang, then sold Nipton for $5 million to American Green, a cannabis company with plans to turn the town into a weed-themed resort geared toward Instagram marijuana influencers. But after only a year, American Green sold Nipton to a subsidiary, who ended up defaulting in payments. Ms. Lang forced a foreclosure and put the town back on the market. In 2021, Mr. Mollison stepped forward.",
      "Mr. Mollison, who signed a $75 million deal with Caesar\u2019s Entertainment in 2021 and reportedly dropped $30 million just on the artwork for his Las Vegas restaurant Superfrico, brings an immense amount of muscle to a town long accustomed to fending for itself.",
      "In every Spiegelworld production \u2014 there are currently four on the Las Vegas Strip, with two more in the works, and two headed soon for Atlantic City \u2014 he is notoriously detail oriented, furiously sweating the small stuff. He\u2019s just as hands-on in Nipton, where on a recent visit he was found jumping excitedly inside a recently converted Spartan Imperial Mansion trailer to review the craftsmanship and map out precisely where future overnight guests would sit and sleep.",
      "Alex and Frank Strebel are production managers, the back-of-house crew who keep theater performances running behind the scenes. They met Mr. Mollison three years ago when he hired them to build props for OPM, Spiegelworld\u2019s space-age themed variety show at The Cosmopolitan hotel. Mr. Mollison liked their handiwork, and he also liked their lifestyle: The couple, both 35, met at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and were living largely off the land of their home in Pahrump, Nev., a town of 40,000 straddling the California border.",
      "They had what it takes, he felt, to turn Nipton around.",
      "\u201cWe rolled up our sleeves and fired up the tractor,\u201d Mr. Strebel said. \u201cOur contractors are two hours away, but we have experience in doing things locally since we built our own house.\u201d",
      "The couple have been living full-time in Nipton since last May, sharing a camper van with their five chickens and two dogs and performing cleanup work that includes repairing septic systems and fixing electric lines.",
      "They\u2019ve also hauled out trash \u2014 a lot of it. At only 80 acres, Nipton has one real road and a smaller footprint than the Mall of America. But Mr. and Ms. Strebel found rotting mattresses, pieces of an old stagecoach, a clogged septic tank and 300 tons of assorted junk when they arrived. After months of cleanup by both tractor and golf cart, they\u2019re now focusing on low-water landscaping and rehabbing the funky public art and rusting aluminum trailers left behind by previous owners.",
      "They\u2019ve taken care to preserve some of the town\u2019s wackier art pieces, including Fly By, a 24-foot-high glass manta ray by Peter Hazel, and Perpetual Consumption, a 26-foot-high sculpture by Clayton Blake in which stacked shopping carts form loop-the-loops meant to symbolize American consumerism. That piece was originally created for Burning Man and brought to Nipton in 2018 by American Green.",
      "Next on the docket is the repurposing of the town\u2019s vacant general store, which was once a destination for Nevada drivers looking to purchase California lottery tickets (thanks to its powerful casino industry, the lottery is prohibited in Nevada), as well as its saloon, where Mr. Mollison threw his dinner party in February.",
      "The town has several one-room cabins that also lack plumbing and are heated in the cold desert nights by freestanding potbellied stoves. Mr. Mollison plans to move those to the other side of Nipton\u2019s main road and allow his performers to individually design and outfit them. The result will be an artist\u2019s village, tentatively named Spiegelville, where performers can stay when coming to Nipton to workshop performances. For tourists, tricked-out aluminum trailers and a planned luxury hotel will, he says, offer plusher accommodations.",
      "Gypsy Wood, an Australian burlesque dancer who performs in OPM, arrived at the February dinner party in her red convertible with her dog Marcello. Like many of Spiegelworld\u2019s artists, circus life was handed down to her by her parents, who were traveling performers in her hometown Adelaide, Australia.",
      "Gypsy is her given name \u2014 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have chosen this as my stage name. I would have chosen something else, like Annabella,\u201d she said \u2014 and she said she is counting the days until the dream of Spiegelville is a reality.",
      "\u201cCircus life is like being on a bus trip that you can\u2019t get off. Vegas is so seductive in that way. But you can\u2019t leave, and there are like three coffee shops so you see everyone all the time. Nipton might be an escape from the drama,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will help you get yourself together.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s certainly been the case for Niko Novick, who has been living in one of those toiletless cabins since last July. Mr. Novick, 32, who refers to himself as Spiegelworld\u2019s \u201ccocktail clown,\u201d runs the beverage program for the company, designing for the multiple bars at each of the company\u2019s three shows, as well as ",
      ", their twisted, debaucherous take on dinner theater where Italian dishes are served with a side of strippers, acrobats and raunchy comedy.",
      "He has a house in Los Angeles, three hours away by car, but prefers to be at Nipton with the company of Mala, his 13-year-old dog. He uses an outdoor shower and restroom, or pops into one of the two bathrooms at the town\u2019s tiny Hotel California, where the actress Clara Bow often stayed in the 1920s. Today, its five bedrooms serve as guest quarters for friends of Spiegelworld who stay the night.",
      "\u201cDeep down, I love solitude,\u201d he said. \u201cComing here allows me to recharge. And that\u2019s when creativity is most rampant.\u201d",
      "Mr. Mollison is committed to fostering that creativity, so much so that he estimates he\u2019ll spend around $20 million to make his dreams for Nipton come true. But he isn\u2019t rushing the process. \u201cPeople come to Las Vegas, and dinner theater is like, someone pretending to be Frank Sinatra and you\u2019ve got to sit there for 30 minutes waiting for it to end,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing about this place is that it\u2019s a surprise, and it\u2019s different from what\u2019s out there. We\u2019re in no hurry.\"",
      "A few hours before the dinner party was set to begin, Mr. Mollison got into his Cirrus airplane and flew over the town, grinning while surveying his purchase from the sky.",
      "He wasn\u2019t thinking about the town\u2019s history of failed endeavors. He was only thinking about his delight in planning its future.",
      "\u201cI want Nipton to be growing as long as we have great ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so excited about this idea. It\u2019s just so much fun.\u201d",

      "The singer and his songs were highly religious. His concert venue, on a kibbutz developed by secular leftists, was definitely not. His audience of many hundreds? It was somewhere in between: some secular, some devout, an unusual blending of two sections of a divided Israeli society that rarely otherwise mix.",
      "Ishay Ribo, 34, is among a crop of young Israeli pop stars from religious backgrounds, some from Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, whose music is attracting more diverse listeners, and featuring prominently in the soundscape of contemporary Israeli life.",
      "This has surprised Mr. Ribo himself.",
      "\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d play to this kind of crowd,\u201d he said, backstage after the show earlier this year at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel, a town in northern Israel originally founded as a collective farm. A decade ago, he said, \u201cThis kind of crowd just didn\u2019t really exist.\u201d",
      "In addition to Mr. Ribo, other singers from a religious background \u2014 like Nathan Goshen, Hanan Ben-Ari, Akiva Turgeman and ",
      " \u2014 have also in recent years gained a wider audience. And their popularity reflects a changing Israeli society.",
      "The religious right has expanded its influence on politics and society, escalating a clash between secular and sacred visions of the country that ",
      ". At the same time, religion has taken on a more prominent, and less contentious, role in the mainstream music scene.",
      "In less than two decades, religious singers have moved from the cultural fringe to widespread acclaim, \u201cnot only among their people, but in all Israel,\u201d said Yoav Kutner, a leading Israeli music critic and radio presenter.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to the words,\u201d Mr. Kutner added, \u201cthey sound like Israeli pop.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo is perhaps the clearest example of this shift. Forgoing the erotic and the profane, his wholesome songs are often prayers to God \u2014 but sung to pop and rock music played by his band of guitarists. ",
      "Cause of causes",
      "he addresses God in one of his biggest hits. \u201cOnly you should be thanked for all the days and nights.\u201d",
      "In 2021, that track, \u201cSibat Hasibot,\u201d was the most played song on Israeli radio stations, religious and secular alike.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of my duty,\u201d Mr. Ribo said in a recent interview. \u201cTo be a bridge between these two worlds.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s journey toward that bridging role began in the early 2000s, on the bus to his religious school.",
      "His family had immigrated from France a few years before. They led an ultra-Orthodox and ascetic life on a settlement in the occupied West Bank, just outside Jerusalem.",
      "The family did not have a television, and Mr. Ribo attended an ultraconservative Jewish seminary. He listened to music on religious radio stations \u2014 often liturgical poems sung in synagogues. He typically heard secular music only on the bus to school, playing from the driver\u2019s radio.",
      "\u201cI had this musical ignorance,\u201d Mr. Ribo said.",
      "At age 11 or so, he began recording simple songs on a portable cassette player. Then as now, his lyrics were infused with piety, Mr. Ribo said. But the tunes were inspired by the mainstream singer-songwriters he\u2019d heard on the school bus.",
      "Some four years later, Mr. Ribo bought a guitar and formed a band with another seminary student. He began to practice and dress as a Modern Orthodox Jew, forgoing the dark coats and wide-brimmed hats of the ultra-Orthodox for jeans and sweaters.",
      "But his awareness of contemporary music and its customs was still patchy. At his band\u2019s first gig, Mr. Ribo played with his back to the audience, unaware of the need to engage with the crowd.",
      "Unlike many Israelis from ultra-Orthodox Jewish backgrounds, he paused his religious studies at age 22 to serve for two years as a conscript in the army. After finishing service in 2013, he tried to build a hybrid musical career \u2014 playing religious music to both secular and devout audiences.",
      "He imagined his melodies might sound like Coldplay, the popular British rock band, but his lyrics, he added, \u201cwould be about God and faith.\u201d",
      "The challenge was that there were few templates then for such a crossover career.",
      "Only a few religious artists, like the folk singer ",
      ", had built a secular following. The most successful religious artists were often those, like Etti Ankri and ",
      ", who had started out secular, became more devout, and then took their original audiences along with them.",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s problem, initially, was that the music industry \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what I had to offer,\u201d he said.",
      "When he sent his music to mainstream record labels, they all turned him down.",
      "Mr. Ribo forged ahead, self-releasing the first of five albums in 2014. He hired a secular manager, Or Davidson, who marketed him as if he was a secular client \u2014 booking him to play at mainstream venues and securing him airtime on nonreligious radio stations. Gradually, his secular fan base expanded.",
      "It was sometimes a fraught balancing act.",
      "Religious Jews criticized him for playing at secular concert halls. Secular Jews opposed his performances at religious venues where men and women sat separately. And when he played to both audiences at secular venues, the staff could not provide kosher food for his religious fans. Even his parents were too religiously observant to attend some of the venues.",
      "But the two-pronged approach ultimately worked. Four of his five albums were classified as gold or above \u2014 selling more than 15,000 copies in the small Israeli market. Secular pop legends, including Shlomo Artzi, began to perform duets with him, and he began to build an audience among diaspora Jews. Later this year, he is scheduled to headline Madison Square Garden, Mr. Davidson said.",
      "To an extent, Mr. Ribo\u2019s appeal is rooted simply in the catchiness of his songs, his clean-cut demeanor and sincere performances.",
      "\u201cEven though I\u2019m secular, I came to watch him because he\u2019s lovely,\u201d said Adiva Liberman, 71, a retired teacher attending his concert at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel.",
      "\u201cNot everyone is paying attention to the lyrics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re just attracted to the melody.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise comes amid not only a political shift rightward in Israel, but demographic changes as well. Religious Israelis, who have ",
      " than secular Israelis, are the fastest-growing part of the population, allowing them to exert greater cultural influence.",
      "Daniel Zamir, an Israeli jazz star who turned religious as an adult, said Mr. Ribo\u2019s broad appeal is part of \u201ca bigger process of Israeli society moving toward tradition.\u201d",
      "Simultaneously, Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise embodies a converse but complementary trend: greater willingness among some religious musicians to cater to and mix with mainstream audiences, and greater demand among religious audiences for music with a more contemporary sound.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca dual process,\u201d Mr. Zamir said. Mr. Ribo is emblematic of \u201cthis new generation that saw that you could be religious and also make great music,\u201d Mr. Zamir added.",
      "For some secular consumers, the rise of \u201cpop emuni\u201d \u2014 \u201cfaith pop\u201d in Hebrew \u2014 has been jarring. \u201cI am not interested in hearing prayers on my radio,\u201d ",
      " Gal Uchovsky, a television presenter, in a 2019 article about the proliferation of Mr. Ribo\u2019s music. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to explain to me, even in songs that brighten my journey, how fun God is.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s latest song, \u201cI Belong to the People,\u201d also caused discomfort among liberal Israelis. Released in early April, it is an attempt to unite Jews at a time of ",
      " in Israel. But critics said it unwittingly sounded condescending to people from other faiths, implying they were idolatrous.",
      "Mr. Ribo has also caused discomfort within the religious world. Some ultra-Orthodox Jews, particularly their religious leaders, feel he has delved too far into secular society.",
      "Early in his career, Mr. Ribo personally felt so conflicted about this that he sought his rabbi\u2019s approval for his work. To avoid alienating his religious base, there are still some lines he refuses to cross.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to write a classic love song \u2014 but I won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Ribo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job or duty.\u201d",
      "Still, some feel he has already compromised too much. In a popular ",
      " performed by an ultra-Orthodox comedy duo, an ultra-Orthodox man is asked if he knows any secular singers.",

      "Although the judge had steeled himself for a grueling fight, the cannabis case was over in mere minutes.",
      "The defendant had been caught in his parents\u2019 house with 7.5 ounces of marijuana, and the judge was getting ready for the prosecution to try him as an adult since he was just 18, and technically could be held responsible under the adult laws.",
      "But the district attorney said he planned to try the case under Germany\u2019s youth laws.",
      "That gave Judge Andreas M\u00fcller an opening. Presiding over the courtroom in the traditional black robe and white tie, he immediately threw out the case, citing a youth court statute that encourages rehabilitation rather than punishment.",
      "\u201cMaybe one day, when you\u2019ve had the chance to learn to become an able businessman, you can become a cannabis entrepreneur,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller told the defendant, eliciting chuckles in the courtroom in\u00a0Bernau bei Berlin, a small, picturesque community north of the German capital. The defendant, Justin H., whose surname is protected by Germany\u2019s strict privacy laws, was too stunned to react other than to nod.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller is famous in Germany for his relentless criticism of the law criminalizing cannabis possession. Often with obvious anger in his voice, he has\u00a0argued against Germany\u2019s cannabis law in numerous TV discussion panels; at pro-cannabis demonstrations; in a book; and even in a ",
      ", all while serving as an active judge. In his courtroom, where he hears mainly youth but also adult cases, he has repeatedly thrown out minor possession cases.",
      "\u201cIt makes me so mad to see so many young people locked up and criminalized just because they use cannabis and not alcohol,\u201d he said during a cigarette break at Bernau\u2019s busy municipal court.",
      "Part of his anger arises both from the frequency of cannabis arrests \u2014 181,000 on minor possession or use charges in 2021 \u2014 and the billions of euros spent enforcing what he said was the \u201cabsurd\u201d law against getting high.",
      "In 2020, Judge M\u00fcller wrote the first complaint to Germany\u2019s highest constitutional court, asking it to overturn the cannabis law. Other judges followed, and the court is now reviewing 10 drug cases sent by three different courts in Germany.",
      "\u201cFor young people like us, it\u2019s pretty inspiring to have someone from an older generation, who is a judge, advocate for a thing that maybe goes against conventional opinion,\u201d said the rapper GReeeN, 33, who often sings favorably about cannabis. \u201cIt\u2019s important \u2014 we need people like him for change.\u201d",
      "GReeeN, whose real name is Pasquale Denefleh, knows the judge from a video they made together. The judge, playing himself, raps about the evils of cannabis prohibition. \u201cSmoking weed is not criminal; smoking weed is normal,\u201d he sings.",
      "The German government has begun taking the judge\u2019s side in the cannabis debate just as the judge, 61, is preparing to retire from the bench.",
      "In mid-April, Karl Lauterbach, the country\u2019s health minister, presented a plan legalizing cannabis for personal use; in the coming months, a more comprehensive plan that would eventually legalize and tax the sale of cannabis is expected to be proposed.",
      "After years of a conservative-run government, the new center-left coalition under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, has signaled it is likely to approve the proposal, which would make Germany the first European country where not only the possession but also the public sale of cannabis is not just decriminalized, but legalized.",
      "Although the changes to the law would have come without his help, Judge M\u00fcller and others believe he played a small part in the overhaul.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that he was instrumental in showing that demands for reform were not just coming from the cannabis community, but from a more established perspective, too,\u201d said Ates G\u00fcrpinar, a member of Parliament and the drug policy spokesman for the far-left Die Linke party, which supports legalizing cannabis.",
      "Before the coalition\u2019s latest plan was announced, Judge M\u00fcller had threatened to organize street protests to put pressure on the government.",
      "That pugnaciousness is a signature part of the judge\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cBecause of his rough edges, he\u2019s not just well-known, he\u2019s also feared,\u201d Mr. G\u00fcrpinar said. \u201cHe will just fire off things even if he knows that it could irritate potential allies.\u201d",
      "Judges in Germany wield a lot of power in their courtrooms, but with a few exceptions \u2014 like a judge ",
      " last December \u2014 they tend to stay out of the political fray.",
      "Not so Judge M\u00fcller, who regularly gets into spats on Twitter, where he has 60,000 followers. He also is the deputy director of the German chapter of LEAP, or Law Enforcement Action Partnership, a cannabis advocacy group run by law-enforcement officers, lawyers and politicians.",
      "Some law-enforcement officials say the judge does not\u00a0sufficiently separate his activism from his day job. In 2020 the local district attorney\u2019s office applied to have him recused from hearing cannabis cases. Ricarda B\u00f6hme, a prosecutor, said in an interview that given \u201cthe objective overall view of his public statements\u201d the judge could in \u201cno way be able to reach an unbiased decision\u201d on such matters.",
      "But a higher court ruled for the judge and he was able to continue hearing those cases.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller was born in the town of Meppen in Lower Saxony. His father, traumatized by his experience as an 18-year-old soldier in World War II, drank himself to death when the judge was 11. His brother spent time in jail on a drug charge and died young. Judge M\u00fcller was the first member of his extended family to graduate from high school.",
      "\u201cIt was a present to my mother,\u201d he said about his career choice.",
      "Starting in Bernau as a judge in 1997, Judge M\u00fcller was part of a generation of judges from the former West Germany who came to the former East Germany to help modernize and democratize the judicial system after the collapse of communism.",
      "For all the leniency he has shown in cannabis trials, he has a reputation as an unsparing judge in other cases.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve sent quite a few people to prison,\u201d he said. A tabloid started calling him \u201cJudge Merciless\u201d until he threatened legal action.",

      ", the leader of North Korea.",
      "Dan-o McShane, as the former U.S. Navy officer is known, had been stationed in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea for six years. Like the rest of the world, he learned of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to meet Mr. Kim in the DMZ on Twitter \u2014 only a day before the meeting was to take place.",
      "Suddenly, the lieutenant commander was thrust into making frantic preparations, his retirement plans scuppered.",
      "\u201cThat started a whole 24-hour communication event that would result in multiple messages passed overnight,\u201d said Commander McShane, who was the American-led United Nations Command\u2019s top military officer at the border in the village of Panmunjom at the time.",
      "\u201cI lay down on the couch for a minute and then at 4 a.m., North Korea would call because they\u2019re working just as hard on their side because Kim Jong-un\u2019s going to come down to them and that\u2019s probably a bigger cult of personality than the Donald Trump cult of personality.\u201d",

      " as the sole point of contact between the two enemies.",
      "Each side has since assigned a joint duty officer\u200b at Panmunjom to help enforce the cease-fire. On the U.N. side, an American Navy officer has typically served a year or two under the U.N. flag. Commander McShane served for a record eight years, from 2013 to 2021, becoming the longest-serving U.N. joint duty officer at Panmunjom in history. He now teaches guitar to wounded American veterans at Camp Humphreys, south of Seoul, as part of a program sponsored by the American Red Cross and the Wounded Warrior Project.",
      "During that time, he faced off with North Korean troops, prepped for the Trump-Kim summit, saw tensions ebb and flow with the political mood and witnessed some of the most \u200bhair-raising \u2014 and \u200bbizarre \u2014 moments \u200bat the DMZ, the world\u2019s most heavily armed border.",
      "His first night on the job, a land mine exploded nearby. The next night, two went off. Soon, he stopped registering them; the DMZ is strewn with two million land mines. Animals step on them all of the time. It was \u201ca bit of a culture shock,\u201d Commander McShane recalled.",
      "Twice a day \u2014 at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. \u2014 he rang his North Korean\u00a0counterpart on a peach-colored phone the U.N. Command operated to ensure that the hotline was open.\u200b The messages were usually mundane: \u201cWe\u2019re trimming the grass over here. Don\u2019t shoot us!\u201d he said.",
      "Some U.S. soldiers in Panmunjom liked to call themselves the \u201cMerry Mad Monks of the DMZ\u201d because serving in such an isolated, off-limits spot was like living in a monastery. They organized cookouts and teed off at \u201c",
      ": a one-hole, par 3 surrounded on three sides by land mines.",
      "Unfamiliar with Navy abbreviations like LCDR, for lieutenant commander, Army soldiers stationed at the DMZ nicknamed Commander McShane \u201cthe Lord Commander,\u201d a reference to the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "He remembered once spotting a white dog ambling around Panmunjom. He fed and played with it for two weeks until it trotted across the demarcation line\u200b\u200b, \u201clike he\u2019s done it 1,000 times.\u201d",
      "The dog went up the stairs of the gray Stalinist building on the North Korean side. A soldier opened the door and the dog walked right in, never to be seen again. \u201cThe joke was, of course, that he\u2019s a spy,\u201d Commander McShane said.",
      "At Panmunjom, North Korean and U.S. officers occasionally meet in person, even talking baseball. The North Koreans loved Doritos and South Korean Choco Pies, Commander McShane said. The U.N. officers also brought Marlboro cigarettes and Johnnie Walker whiskey as gifts.",

      " before making it to the South, shot but alive. By then, the hotline was no longer working; the North Koreans had switched it off to protest U.N. sanctions imposed on the country after its third nuclear test in 2013.",
      "After the soldier\u2019s defection, Commander McShane and his \u200byoung \u200btranslator were ordered by his higher-ups to go outside with a bullhorn to deliver a message, standing near the borderline.",
      "It was dark and raining. Earlier that day, \u200bhe had heard \u200ba single gunshot from the North\u200b, likely the sound of \u200ban officer killing himself, knowing his fate for failing to stop the defector, Commander McShane recalled.",
      "Commander McShane used the bullhorn to\u200b invite the North to a joint investigation\u200b of the defection. \u200bBack in his office, \u200bhe saw a \u200bNorth Korean \u200bflashlight blinking\u200b at him\u200b, and he was ordered to go back outside and repeat the message. His translator hid behind a brick wall until she had to repeat the message in Korean.",
      "\u201cThey never replied to that series of messages, but that was the only time I ever felt super unsafe giving a message,\u201d the commander said.",
      "The Navy kept extending Commander McShane\u2019s tour because it had difficulty finding a qualified replacement. A joint duty officer at Panmunjom must be a lieutenant commander with a master\u2019s degree in East Asian studies and rigorous Korean language training. On the day of the Trump-Kim summit, the Navy extended his tour for the fifth time.",

The North Korean \u201cguys are just furious with me,\u201d he recalled. They wondered, \u201c\u2018How can you not have all this American stuff up here?\u2019\u201d",

      "A Marine Corps helicopter had to bring more American flags from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. He used coat hangers for a flag spreader.",
      "Daniel Edward McShane III speaks with a slight Southern accent and calls himself \u201ca little talky.\u201d Born in Charlotte, N.C., in 1970, he joined the Navy in 1999, and flew over Afghanistan and Iraq before being ",

      "Soldiers at Panmunjom would later tease him, calling Ms. Kim his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d",

Commander McShane\u2019s top boss, U.S. Army Gen. Robert B. Abrams, told\u200b him: \u201cDon\u2019t let that tree die.\u201d (He added that the general was \u201ca little more forceful than that.\u201d)",
      "For a couple months, Commander McShane used a hose to water the tree himself. \u201cIn the DMZ, there are very few things you can point to as a visual kind of containment of hope,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep that thing going.\u201d",

      "\u201cTienen un buen espacio\u201d, le dijo el papa, trazando un cuadrado con las manos durante una audiencia privada el mes pasado, al reverendo Andrew Small, quien gestiona la comisi\u00f3n del papa para combatir los abusos sexuales. \u201c\u00bfYa se mudaron?\u201d.",
      "Desde que Francisco cre\u00f3 la Comisi\u00f3n Pontificia para la Protecci\u00f3n de Menores en 2014, el personal ocupaba, y desbordaba, una antigua residencia del Vaticano cerca del apartamento del papa. Si bien la ubicaci\u00f3n al principio suger\u00eda una proximidad al poder, en la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada la comisi\u00f3n ha visto c\u00f3mo su influencia se ha erosionado debido a los intereses arraigados del Vaticano y las deserciones. Small dijo que su personal deb\u00eda tomar prestadas oficinas en la Santa Sede \u201ccomo beduinos\u201d cuando los obispos se reun\u00edan con ellos. Coment\u00f3 que para los sobrevivientes de abusos era dif\u00edcil encontrar su rinc\u00f3n escondido.",
      "As\u00ed que en a\u00f1os recientes, la comisi\u00f3n busc\u00f3, sin aspavientos, un cambio, aunque fuera un cambio de direcci\u00f3n, para reafirmar lo importante que es para la Iglesia proteger a los ni\u00f1os. La b\u00fasqueda de un lugar termin\u00f3 el mes pasado, cuando la comisi\u00f3n se hizo del control de unas oficinas libre de renta en un majestuoso ",
      " del siglo XVI controlado por la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica en pleno centro de Roma.",
      "La comisi\u00f3n asegura que las nuevas oficinas, de las que hasta ahora no se hab\u00eda informado, en el Palazzo Maffei Marescotti, que se encuentra a unos pasos del Pante\u00f3n, revelan un compromiso concreto con las v\u00edctimas y una clara respuesta a algunas fuerzas del Vaticano que, en su opini\u00f3n, preferir\u00edan que el tema de los abusos sexuales permaneciera oculto o distante.",
      "Lejos de ser un exilio, Small defini\u00f3 el traslado como una expansi\u00f3n hacia una sede mundial en Roma que pueda servir de monumento a \u201cla masacre silenciosa de la infancia de las personas\u201d y dejarles claro a los sobrevivientes que \u201ctienen derecho a estar en un lugar hermoso\u201d.",
      "\u201cEs muy significativo\u201d, dijo en una entrevista Sean O\u2019Malley, arzobispo de Boston y presidente de la comisi\u00f3n.",
      "A pesar de ser \u201cestupendo\u201d haber estado en unas oficinas a pocos pasos del papa, afirm\u00f3, \u201cnos dimos cuenta de que no era tan accesible como nos gustar\u00eda\u201d. O\u2019Malley coment\u00f3 que los sobrevivientes de abusos sexuales por parte de cl\u00e9rigos a menudo se sienten inc\u00f3modos al entrar en una iglesia cat\u00f3lica: \u201cTener que entrar en el Vaticano y pasar por la Guardia Suiza y los gendarmes y todo lo dem\u00e1s puede ser bastante intimidante\u201d.",
      "La ubicaci\u00f3n dista de ser el \u00fanico problema de la comisi\u00f3n. Durante d\u00e9cadas, la Iglesia ha estado polarizada en torno a la asignaci\u00f3n de responsabilidad de su jerarqu\u00eda a la hora de encubrir abusos, a la voz que debe darse a las v\u00edctimas dentro de una instituci\u00f3n herm\u00e9tica y a la conveniencia de adoptar un enfoque m\u00e1s gradual o contundente hacia una reforma.",
      "Francisco anunci\u00f3 la creaci\u00f3n de la comisi\u00f3n en 2013, en medio de preocupaciones de que no tomaba en serio el tema, pero su funci\u00f3n termin\u00f3 siendo solo de consultor\u00eda. Los comisionados, entre los que hab\u00eda algunos sobrevivientes, acabaron renunciando en se\u00f1al de protesta, y acusaron al Vaticano de obstruccionismo.",
      "Con o sin oficinas nuevas, la inestabilidad no ha terminado. El mes pasado, Hans Zollner, jesuita alem\u00e1n, quien tal vez sea el mayor experto de la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica en la lucha contra los abusos y el miembro m\u00e1s destacado de la comisi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n renunci\u00f3.",
      "Cuestion\u00f3 la independencia de la comisi\u00f3n y la ",
      " por no brindar \u201cresponsabilidad, cumplimiento, rendici\u00f3n de cuentas y transparencia\u201d.",
      "\u201cEl padre Hans no estuvo muy presente con nosotros el a\u00f1o pasado, as\u00ed que me sorprendi\u00f3 mucho\u201d, dijo O\u2019Malley sobre la contundente declaraci\u00f3n de Zollner, y a\u00f1adi\u00f3: \u201cNo entiendo cu\u00e1les son sus motivaciones para irse, pero trataremos de entender y abordar sus preocupaciones\u201d.",
      "Cuando se le pregunt\u00f3 al cardenal si pensaba que Zollner, de quien algunos de los miembros de la comisi\u00f3n sospechaban que estaba intentando crear un centro de protecci\u00f3n de menores paralelo en una universidad pontificia romana, intentaba sabotear la comisi\u00f3n, respondi\u00f3: \u201cA estas alturas, no s\u00e9 lo que piensa\u201d (Zollner no respondi\u00f3 a una solicitud de comentarios).",
      "O\u2019Malley prefiri\u00f3 hablar sobre la apertura de las nuevas oficinas de protecci\u00f3n en Sudam\u00e9rica y de las nuevas medidas de rendici\u00f3n de cuentas que Francisco consagr\u00f3 en la legislaci\u00f3n eclesi\u00e1stica el mes pasado.",
      "El cardenal manifest\u00f3 que el papa hab\u00eda aprobado de manera expl\u00edcita la visibilidad que proporcionaba la nueva sede de la comisi\u00f3n en el coraz\u00f3n de Roma, lo que, seg\u00fan O\u2019Malley, deber\u00eda ayudar a \u201cdisipar los temores de que estamos siendo exiliados del Vaticano\u201d.",
      "Sin embargo, encontrar ese espacio no fue tarea f\u00e1cil.",
      "Small, un veterano del Capitolio gracias a su gesti\u00f3n como asesor de pol\u00edtica exterior de la Conferencia Episcopal de Estados Unidos, dijo que para encontrar el lugar adecuado tuvo que recurrir a las lecciones que aprendi\u00f3 en Washington sobre \u201calinear intereses\u201d y respondi\u00f3 a los portazos de rechazo con un decidido: \u201cBueno, ya lo veremos\u201d.",
      "Muchas veces se top\u00f3 con una actitud de rechazo t\u00edpica de la actitud \u201cNIMBY\u201d (acr\u00f3nimo en ingl\u00e9s de \u201cNo en mi patio trasero\u201d), en la que los propietarios de las iglesias ve\u00edan a la comisi\u00f3n \u201ccomo una cl\u00ednica de metadona\u201d.",
      "\u201cNadie la quiere en su patio trasero\u201d, coment\u00f3.",
      "En 2021, Small se encontr\u00f3 con el Palazzo Maffei Marescotti, una propiedad de la Santa Sede fuera del Vaticano que alberga oficinas de caridad, una oficina de correos y la oficina de peregrinaje de la Iglesia. El exdirector de esa oficina, monse\u00f1or Liberio Andreatta, quien est\u00e1 a cargo del edificio, vive en el palazzo y es una figura con buenos contactos y conocida en los c\u00edrculos clericales y pol\u00edticos romanos por su amplia cartera inmobiliaria.",
      "O\u2019Malley le escribi\u00f3 una carta al secretario de Estado del Vaticano en la que indagaba sobre la propiedad u otras ubicaciones adecuadas y tambi\u00e9n recurri\u00f3 al Administraci\u00f3n del Patrimonio de la Sede Apost\u00f3lica, la oficina que se encarga de la gesti\u00f3n de los inmuebles de la Iglesia, que en esencia respondi\u00f3 con un cartel de \u201cno hay habitaciones disponibles\u201d.",
      "Small coment\u00f3 que el equivalente de la alcald\u00eda para la Ciudad del Vaticano tambi\u00e9n le dijo a la comisi\u00f3n que se olvidara de los planes de expansi\u00f3n en las oficinas que ten\u00eda en el Vaticano y les inform\u00f3 que tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan ser desalojados para brindarle espacio a los cardenales que necesitaran alojamiento en caso de que se celebrara un c\u00f3nclave para elegir al pr\u00f3ximo papa (el Vaticano declin\u00f3 hacer comentarios).",
      "Al final, Small afirm\u00f3 que su insistencia y la carta de O\u2019Malley hicieron que Andreatta accediera mostrarles unas peque\u00f1as habitaciones en la azotea del palazzo que Small describi\u00f3 como \u201crepletas de palomas\u201d.",
      "En noviembre pasado, O\u2019Malley fue a realizar una inspecci\u00f3n del sitio y le mostraron una serie de habitaciones en ruinas y con techos altos, que estaban disponibles si la comisi\u00f3n pagaba los costos de su restauraci\u00f3n. Mientras la comisi\u00f3n estudiaba la posibilidad de realizar una campa\u00f1a de recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos, una reorganizaci\u00f3n de la oficina del vicario de Roma llev\u00f3 al obispo Baldassare Reina, un siciliano simpatizante, a ocupar el cargo de vicerregente. Seg\u00fan Small, Reina ejerci\u00f3 m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n sobre Andreatta y consigui\u00f3 que el papa aprobara las nuevas oficinas en unas salas menos grandiosas pero m\u00e1s pr\u00e1cticas, ubicadas al otro lado del pasillo.",
      "\u201cTrabajamos con discreci\u00f3n\u201d, escribi\u00f3 Andreatta en un comunicado, y agreg\u00f3 que las visitas al lugar sirvieron \u201cpara definir mejor las necesidades y la disponibilidad\u201d de la comisi\u00f3n y que \u201ctodo lo dem\u00e1s es una reconstrucci\u00f3n fantasiosa\u201d.",
      "Una tarde reciente, algunos miembros del personal entraron a las oficinas por primera vez. Small pidi\u00f3 con cautela al conserje del edificio que le ense\u00f1ara los espacios comunes del palazzo en el segundo piso.",
      "\u201cPor supuesto\u201d, dijo. \u201cEsta es su casa\u201d.",
      "Detr\u00e1s de la puerta, aguardaban cornisas doradas, frisos pintados de paisajes y escudos de armas, as\u00ed como yeser\u00edas ornamentales de querubines y \u00e1ngeles. Small imagin\u00f3 el espacio como un lugar ideal para organizar eventos de recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos y la sesi\u00f3n plenaria de la comisi\u00f3n en mayo, pero tambi\u00e9n para las intervenciones de las v\u00edctimas, incluidas lecturas de diarios que deber\u00edan ser \u201chonrados y respetados para que aprendamos del pasado\u201d.",
      "Small ten\u00eda dise\u00f1os de una capilla deteriorada del siglo XVI con vidrieras junto a sus oficinas en el piso de arriba, e imagin\u00f3 una capilla sin denominaci\u00f3n para que las v\u00edctimas que hab\u00edan perdido la fe pudieran recuperar alguna medida de espiritualidad, y \u201cno necesariamente a trav\u00e9s de la Iglesia que los lastim\u00f3 tanto\u201d.",
      "Mientras los t\u00e9cnicos del Vaticano llegaban para instalar el acceso a internet en las nuevas oficinas, el personal de la comisi\u00f3n recorri\u00f3 las habitaciones m\u00e1s augustas pero decr\u00e9pitas al otro lado del pasillo, que estaban disponibles para la comisi\u00f3n si lograban renovarlas.",
      "Rosanna Giacometto, una especialista en traumatolog\u00eda de 50 a\u00f1os, revis\u00f3 la gran pantalla plana en la pared en busca de puertos, \u201cHDMI\u201d, afirm\u00f3. \u201cEsto es importante\u201d. A unos metros de distancia, Sheila Kinsey, una veterana de los refugios para abusos sexuales en Estados Unidos, admir\u00f3 la pintura del techo que mostraba caballos m\u00edticos impulsando una carroza y reflexion\u00f3 sobre \u201cintentar descifrar a d\u00f3nde vamos como equipo\u201d.",

      "Desde su natal Rumania hasta un intento fallido de solicitud de asilo en B\u00e9lgica y despu\u00e9s un divorcio y dificultades econ\u00f3micas, la enfermedad de Iosif ha exacerbado crisis de su vida que casi siempre se han salido de control.",
      "Sin embargo, sentado a la mesa del comedor por cuyas puertas de cristal se ve el bosque, parec\u00eda tranquilo.",
      "Hablaba acerca de sus labores cotidianas (alimentar al burro, lavar los trastes), sus pasatiempos preferidos (leer la Biblia, ir de compras), sus preocupaciones (olvidarse de tomar las pastillas, gastar m\u00e1s de la cuenta).",
      "En la sala de estar, los sonidos de los dibujos animados llenaban el ambiente. Etty, de 71 a\u00f1os, y Luc Hayen, de 75, estaban fascinados viendo un programa infantil de un rat\u00f3n en una descabellada aventura. En un sof\u00e1 color crema hab\u00eda un gato acurrucado.",
      "Todos ellos viven con Ann Peetermans, una cosmet\u00f3loga de 47 a\u00f1os, y su hijo adolescente, gracias a un acuerdo a largo plazo mediante el cual personas con enfermedades mentales se mudan con familias de la localidad.",
      "Se trata de un tipo de atenci\u00f3n psiqui\u00e1trica que, de acuerdo con los archivos, ha existido en Geel desde el siglo XIII. A mediados del siglo XIV, los lugare\u00f1os empezaron a construir una iglesia para Santa Dimpna, la santa patrona de los enfermos mentales, y la llegada de peregrinos a Geel no se hizo esperar. Se alojaban en las granjas de los campesinos de la localidad, donde trabajaban la tierra al lado de sus nuevas familias.",
      "Tanto la iglesia como esa tradici\u00f3n siguen en pie.",
      "Para finales del siglo XIX, casi 2000 hu\u00e9spedes viv\u00edan con los habitantes de Geel. En la actualidad, este pueblo de 41.000 habitantes en Flandes, la regi\u00f3n de B\u00e9lgica donde se habla neerland\u00e9s, alberga 120 hu\u00e9spedes en las casas de los lugare\u00f1os.",
      "Eso ha convertido a Geel tanto en un modelo de un prototipo diferente de tratamiento psiqui\u00e1trico como en un caso at\u00edpico, el cual ha tendido a generar desconfianza a lo largo de los siglos (hasta The New York Times en un ",

      "Esa desconfianza no hizo m\u00e1s que aumentar cuando el modelo de Geel choc\u00f3 con la psiquiatr\u00eda, un campo de la medicina que estaba en constante desarrollo. Sin embargo, en \u00e9pocas m\u00e1s recientes, la ciudad ha sido reconsiderada como el s\u00edmbolo de una alternativa compasiva al abandono o la reclusi\u00f3n que se destina en otros lugares para quienes padecen alguna enfermedad mental.",

      "Para Sacks, quien hab\u00eda visitado Geel, la respuesta era aceptar la enfermedad mental como una particularidad individual y no como una discapacidad estigmatizante.",

      "Desde la d\u00e9cada de 1860, Geel ha tenido su propio hospital psiqui\u00e1trico estatal, el cual es el eje y la red de seguridad de este programa.",
      "Wilfried Bogaerts, uno de los psic\u00f3logos principales de ah\u00ed, se\u00f1al\u00f3 que encontrar pacientes para el programa de hogares de acogida no ten\u00eda que ver tanto con su diagn\u00f3stico, sino m\u00e1s bien con qu\u00e9 tan estables eran sus trastornos. Entre los hu\u00e9spedes hay personas con esquizofrenia u otros tipos de psicosis grave, pero que siguen un tratamiento y son capaces de ser funcionales dentro de una familia.",
      "Se realiza un emparejamiento de los posibles hu\u00e9spedes con familias que ya han sido evaluadas y cuyos hogares han sido aprobados para hospedar a alguien.",
      "A las familias de acogida nunca se les revela el diagn\u00f3stico, a menos que el hu\u00e9sped quiera compartirlo. Los trabajadores sociales se enfocan m\u00e1s bien en preparar a las familias para el tipo de comportamientos que deben esperar, el r\u00e9gimen de medicaci\u00f3n y las se\u00f1ales de alerta que deben notificar de inmediato.",
      "Algo fundamental para la confianza en este acuerdo es que hay trabajadores sociales disponibles las 24 horas del d\u00eda en el hospital cercano.",
      "\u201cEl cuidado en hogares de acogida es un tratamiento psiqui\u00e1trico, lo cual implica que todo el personal que se puede encontrar en un hospital psiqui\u00e1trico t\u00edpico participa en el tratamiento del hogar de acogida\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Bogaerts.",
      "El gobierno de B\u00e9lgica les proporciona a las familias de acogida una remuneraci\u00f3n de 23 a 28 euros (25-30 d\u00f3lares) al d\u00eda por cada hu\u00e9sped, cantidad que, a decir de todos, no es suficiente.",
      "Adem\u00e1s, el programa se ha estado reduciendo de manera constante en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, pero tanto la comunidad local como el hospital est\u00e1n tratando de revertir esa tendencia. Hace poco, B\u00e9lgica present\u00f3 una solicitud para que la UNESCO, la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Educaci\u00f3n, la Ciencia y la Cultura, reconozca el programa de hogares de acogida de Geel como un \u201cpatrimonio cultural intangible\u201d. Los responsables del programa tambi\u00e9n han puesto en marcha una campa\u00f1a publicitaria para que m\u00e1s familias quieran ofrecer hogares de acogida.",
      "\u201cCreo que es importante que mis nietos, por ejemplo, aprendan a vivir con personas que sufren esos trastornos\u201d, coment\u00f3 Greet Vandeperre, de 66 a\u00f1os, quien encabeza un grupo comunitario que representa a las familias de acogida, a los hu\u00e9spedes, al hospital, al pueblo y a la polic\u00eda.",
      "Para muchos, los hu\u00e9spedes se convierten en familia. Los nietos peque\u00f1os de Ingrid Daems y Hugo Vanopstal conocen a Janina Bak, la hu\u00e9sped de sus abuelos durante 18 a\u00f1os, solo como \u201ct\u00eda Nina\u201d. No est\u00e1n seguros de c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n emparentados exactamente, pero en visitas semanales a lo largo de sus vidas, se han sentado en su regazo, comido con ella y celebrado con ella.",
      "Cuando Bak se enferm\u00f3 gravemente con un problema hep\u00e1tico, pas\u00f3 nueve semanas en coma y un total de cuatro meses en el hospital, Daems estuvo all\u00ed para ayudarla a superarlo y darle la bienvenida de regreso a casa.",
      "\u201cElla es mi \u00e1ngel guardi\u00e1n\u201d, dijo.",
      "La trayectoria de varias d\u00e9cadas que Vandeperre ha tenido en el cuerpo de polic\u00eda de Geel le otorga una visi\u00f3n acerca de las preguntas que surgen con frecuencia a partir de la experiencia del pueblo: \u00bfes seguro este enfoque?, y \u00bfel modelo de Geel solo puede existir en Geel?",
      "Es com\u00fan que las autoridades de Geel se encuentren con hu\u00e9spedes que se comportan de manera extra\u00f1a en p\u00fablico o que incluso no respetan la ley, coment\u00f3 Vandeperre. Pero gracias a la cultura de los hogares de acogida de este pueblo, saben c\u00f3mo calmar estas situaciones y llamar de inmediato al hospital psiqui\u00e1trico.",
      "Este enfoque se diferencia del de Estados Unidos y otros lugares, donde es posible que lo primero que se haga sea llamar a las fuerzas del orden cuando alguien est\u00e1 teniendo una crisis de salud mental. En muchas situaciones en las que participan polic\u00edas con un entrenamiento inadecuado, los resultados pueden ser ",
      ".",
      "Ellen Baxter, por ejemplo, cree que se pueden replicar los elementos fundamentales del modelo de Geel y ha pasado los \u00faltimos 35 a\u00f1os de su vida tratando de recrearlos en Nueva York.",
      "En 1975, Baxter, fundadora y directora de Broadway Housing Communities, una organizaci\u00f3n neoyorquina de beneficencia en el tema de la vivienda, estaba reci\u00e9n egresada de la licenciatura en psicolog\u00eda cuando, impaciente por saber m\u00e1s sobre el programa de familias de acogida, se fue un a\u00f1o a vivir a Geel. Regres\u00f3 a Nueva York y comenz\u00f3 a recabar fondos para construir edificios donde las personas con trastornos psiqui\u00e1tricos pudieran vivir dentro de una comunidad.",
      "El desarrollo m\u00e1s reciente, en el vecindario Sugar Hill de Harlem, es el que ella cree que se asemeja m\u00e1s a un \u201cGeel vertical\u201d. Este alberga familias y adultos solteros, algunos de los cuales viven con enfermedades mentales y muchos otros que no las padecen. Este complejo cuenta con un centro de cuidado diurno y un museo que atrae a quienes no viven en \u00e9l. Ah\u00ed todos se conocen.",
      "\u201cSe requieren dos elementos: un buen dise\u00f1o y tiempo\u201d, puntualiz\u00f3 Baxter en una entrevista.",
      "\u201cLa vida tiene que ver m\u00e1s con el pragmatismo de la cotidianeidad: hay contratiempos, hay gente que fallece y ni\u00f1os que nacen\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cLa proximidad de la experiencia dentro de una comunidad hace que los valores afloren, que no abandonemos a los ancianos ni a los enfermos mentales ni a los discapacitados\u201d.",
      "Bogaerts, el psic\u00f3logo, recuerda que la polic\u00eda fue llamada solo dos veces para resolver problemas importantes relacionados con los internos en Geel durante las dos d\u00e9cadas.",
      "Pero los incidentes ocurren.",
      "\u201cAlgunos d\u00edas son un poco m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles que otros\u201d, dijo Peetermans.",
      "Liliane Peeters, de 63 a\u00f1os, y su esposo, Jozef Vleugels, de 65, hab\u00edan estado albergando a un hu\u00e9sped durante 11 a\u00f1os cuando decidieron acoger a una segunda persona.",
      "Como una madre cuyos hijos ya no viv\u00edan en casa y que se hab\u00eda jubilado recientemente, Peeters sinti\u00f3 que su hogar ten\u00eda espacio para uno m\u00e1s. Despu\u00e9s de algunos ajustes menores, como averiguar que el nuevo hu\u00e9sped ten\u00eda problemas para hacer s\u00e1ndwiches, las cosas parecieron calmarse.",
      "\u201cQuer\u00eda asumir ese cuidado, tengo eso en alg\u00fan lugar dentro de m\u00ed\u201d, dijo. \u201cDe hecho, quer\u00eda a alguien para quien pudiera hacer los s\u00e1ndwiches\u201d.",
      "Un problema era que el ba\u00f1o estaba en un piso diferente al dormitorio del hu\u00e9sped, al pie de unas escaleras empinadas, y por la noche, Peeters le pidi\u00f3 que no lo usara para evitar ca\u00eddas.",
      "Una ma\u00f1ana, se despert\u00f3 y encontr\u00f3 al hu\u00e9sped en crisis despu\u00e9s de haber defecado en el piso del dormitorio. Peeters consigui\u00f3 guantes y un cepillo. Un asistente social la ayud\u00f3. El hu\u00e9sped regres\u00f3 al hospital.",
      "\u201cHay l\u00edmites en la atenci\u00f3n que las personas pueden dar y dar\u00e1n\u201d, dijo Bogaerts, el psic\u00f3logo. \u201cSi pasan cosas as\u00ed, si alguien ya lleva 10, 15 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s viviendo en una familia de acogida, entonces lograr\u00e1 encontrar una soluci\u00f3n\u201d. Agreg\u00f3: \u201cPero si sucede al principio, es demasiado\u201d.",

      "Chernobyl was also one of the first areas Russian tanks rolled through as they swept out of Belarus in the hopes of seizing Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, about 75 miles to the south. And it was one of the first places they were driven out, forced to withdraw at the end of last March.",
      "Visiting the zone a year later, past calamity and current tragedy intersect in strange and fascinating ways.",
      "The meltdown in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, has tainted the land for hundreds of years to come and laid bare the dangers of a political culture built on lies. It contributed to the demise of the Communist system and the collapse of the Soviet Union.",
      "Russia\u2019s invasion was justified with other Kremlin lies: that Ukrainian statehood was a myth, and that Kyiv was ruled by Nazis.",
      "Before the war, ",
      ", once home to tens of thousands of atomic workers before it was abandoned, had become a dark tourist attraction for those drawn to post-apocalyptic desolation. The Soviet-era apartment blocks crumbled as wolves prowled the hallways. A Ferris wheel in an amusement park that was scheduled to open on May 1, 1986, gathered more rust with each passing year.",
      "Visiting the villages around Chernobyl offered a chance to step into a moment frozen in time, with everything left where it was more than three decades ago. Children\u2019s toys sit in yards thick with brush. Tattered clothes are strewn in bedrooms where residents left them as they fled. A dusty cradle glimpsed through a broken window pane offers a reminder that in a now-dead place, there was once new life.",
      "Now, with cities across Ukraine obliterated, the ruins of Chernobyl feel less otherworldly than grimly familiar. Distant explosions set off by animals stepping on mines laid by the Russians are a reminder that this land from the past is very much part of the present.",

      "\u201cThis is the time when over 5,000 Russian military vehicles entered the zone, drove along the ground roads, and then soldiers started digging the trenches,\u201d Mr. Kirejev said. \u201cThey churned up the radioactive dust that was in the upper layer of the ground.\u201d",

      "Even a quick look at the bunkers the Russians carved out in the most contaminated parts of the zone made clear how careless they had been. The soldiers also set fires and cooked on dirt so radioactive that it made a Geiger counter leap off the charts when tested on a recent visit. There are conflicting reports about whether Russian soldiers fell sick from radiation poisoning.",
      "For the small band of aging residents who remain in the zone, the Russian invasion and the nuclear disaster are catastrophes that bookend their lives.",

      "Before the meltdown, Ms. Voloshyna said, Chernobyl was a company town known for its great natural beauty. She was 36 and the director of the local kindergarten when the night sky lit up before dawn on April 26, 1986. In the days after the meltdown, she joined other residents in shoveling sand into sacks that were flown by helicopters and dumped in the reactor.",

      ". Then the power and water were cut off. But Ms. Voloshyna was determined to stay in the home built by her grandfather more than half a century earlier, nestled on the banks of the Pripyat River.",
      "Unlike when the meltdown happened, the danger from the Russians who stormed in last winter was immediately clear. That night, one resident, Evgen Markevych, 86, put his thoughts down in his diary.",

    "name": "As Gaza Celebrates Eid, a Gift for Women \u2014 and a Duty for Men",
    "author": "Raja Abdulrahim",

      "GAZA CITY \u2014 On the morning of Eid al-Fitr, Arafat Helles will start the day with a special prayer at the mosque to mark the end of Ramadan, and eat a breakfast of salty cheeses to line his stomach for what is to come. Then, he will set out with his three brothers and father across the Gaza Strip.",
      "They will begin with their mother but eventually visit some 15 sisters, aunts and nieces, doling out dinars and shekels as part of a Palestinian custom of men marking the Muslim holiday by giving an eidiya, a gift of money, to female relatives.",
      "The visits will follow an almost choreographed routine. At each home, the men will be plied with coffee and sweets. After little more than 15 minutes, the social calls will end \u2014 a rarity in a society where such visits may last for hours, and often end in an invitation to stay for dinner.",
      "\u201cThis is the eidiya visit,\u201d said Mr. Helles, 48, a professor of social services at Al-Quds Open University, in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our important traditions.\u201d",
      "Giving an eidiya has long been a practice among Muslims \u2014 though it has no religious basis \u2014 and is believed by some to date back 1,000 years to the Fatimid dynasty and the practice of emirs giving gold coins or gifts during festivities.",
      "But in most Muslim cultures, adults give an eidiya to children, sometimes in small, token amounts. Palestinians give the money to both children and adult female relatives, making the tradition far more expensive, with the kind of financial burden and expectations that Christmas gift giving has in the West. The amounts can range from 20 shekels, about $6, to 365 shekels, about $100.",
      "These days, coming up with the money for the eidiya is especially onerous.",
      "The 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt has undermined the living conditions of more than two million Palestinians, and led to a nearly 50 percent unemployment rate that is among the highest in the world.",
      "To give the eidiya, some men will go into debt. Others will wait until their wives get their eidiya from relatives before turning around and using that money to give the gift to their other female relatives.",
      "\u201cHowever bad one\u2019s financial situation is, we have to go and give,\u201d said Mr. Helles\u2019s father, Hamid al-Abid Helles, 74. \u201cThis is a tradition we won\u2019t abandon.\u201d",
      "The practice comes at the end of a month of already added expenses for Ramadan, with the elaborate dinners after daily fasts, and decoration of homes and purchase of new clothes to be worn on Eid. In the weeks leading up to the holiday \u2014 which this year begins on Friday \u2014 shopping districts in Gaza were packed, with seasonal religious music just audible over the din of shoppers and honking horns.",
      "At each relative\u2019s house, Mr. Helles, his brothers and father will be served strong Turkish coffee, Eid date ",
      " and chocolates \u2014 part of the Eid diyafah, or hospitality. They will eat just enough to be polite but remain conscious that at the next stop they will be offered the same spread and encouraged to indulge.",
      "\u201cBy the end we have a stomachache,\u201d said Mr. Helles, a father of six. \u201cWe put all the chocolate in our pockets and tell them we\u2019ll eat it later.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe comes back home and his pocket is bulging with chocolates,\u201d said his wife, Basima Helles, 44.",
      "During each visit, the men will keep an eye on their watches. After 15 minutes, they\u2019ll begin making moves to leave, and call to the women of the house to accept the eidiya. The women, in turn, will protest out of politeness. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no need,\u201d they\u2019ll say. Some will put their hands behind their backs to avoid being handed the money.",
      "To lessen the embarrassment of bills being pressed into palms, shops across Gaza are now offering eidiya cards and small boxes to put the money in, to make the custom feel more like gift giving and less transactional. Some cards mention every female relation that could be on the receiving end of an eidiya: my granddaughter, my wife, my mother-in-law.",
      "Every year Ms. Helles tells her own brother not to give her an eidiya, because she knows that his financial situation is precarious, and that she is one of six sisters.",
      "\u201cWe say, \u2018we forgive you, we excuse you,\u2019 but he\u2019s not willing to come empty-handed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe considers this a social obligation.\u201d",
      "The next day, when women go to visit their families for Eid, she will return the money by giving it as an eidiya to his children.",
      "As the economic situation in Gaza has worsened in recent years, men unable to afford the gift giving have stopped visiting relatives altogether during Eid to avoid embarrassment.",
      "But religious leaders urge men not to abandon a religious obligation \u2014 visiting family \u2014 for the sake of a cultural one \u2014 the eidiya.",
      "That message hasn\u2019t always been heeded.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have an eidiya, it\u2019s better not to go,\u201d said Abdulmutee Matar, 31. \u201cBecause they are accustomed to when you greet them and shake hands, you have money in your hand. If your hand is empty .\u2026\u201d he trailed off, waving his empty hand in the air for emphasis.",
      "He used to give 50 shekels each to his wife, mother, four sisters and eight aunts when he ran his family\u2019s third-generation clothing store. But three years ago, he had to close the shop.",
      "Since then, he has only had occasional work but is still unwilling to give up the tradition. His mother, a teacher, gives him money so he can at least go see his sisters to give the eidiya. He no longer visits his aunts on Eid.",
      "For women, the eidiya can be an extra financial boost.",
      "Last year, Hanadi Tawaahena\u2019s father gave an eidiya to her three sisters and mother but not to her. He told her that was because she had a home baking business and was making her own money.",
      "\u201cThe eidiya is important, even if I work,\u201d said Ms. Tawaahena, 34, last week as she made Eid cookies in a house smelling of ghee and semolina flour. The sweets\u00a0will be part of the diyafah in homes across Gaza. She said it was not just a matter of money, but a matter of principle and being part of a longstanding tradition.",
      "She added with a laugh, \u201cI told him, \u2018Don\u2019t do that again.\u2019\u201d",
      "For other women, it is about the money, and they plan well in advance what to do with their haul, including buying a needed household item or clothes for their children.",
      "Ms. Tawaahena\u2019s sister, Shoroq, 28, was rolling out ground dates to stuff the cookies. She had already made plans with her friends to take their eidiya money and spend it at Gaza City\u2019s boardwalk and restaurants.",
      "\u201cWomen on Eid become rich,\u201d Hanadi Tawaahena said, with another laugh.",
      "Sitting on the other end of the table, rolling out dough, the sisters\u2019 mother, 50-year-old Ashjan, agreed.",
      "\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cthey make the men poor.\u201d"

      "On a recent sunny morning on the banks of the Adda River in northern Italy, schoolchildren on a class trip to Imbersago \u2014 the \u201cTown of the Ferry of Leonardo da Vinci\u201d \u2014 gathered next to a moored boat and listened as a guide explained how the flights of the river\u2019s birds, the formations of its rocks and the workings of its ships inspired Leonardo\u2019s genius.",
      "\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it move?\u201d one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, \u201cService suspended.\u201d It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.",
      "\u201cThe water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,\u201d answered Sara Asperti, 45. \u201cAlso, they\u2019re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.\u201d",
      "Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks\u00a0of the Adda\u00a0belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and ",
      " the motorless ferry around 1513. Later, the invention of the ferry, or its improvement, was attributed to him, though locals say no one knows for sure.",
      "In the past century, reproductions of the original\u00a0ferries have linked Italy\u2019s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.",
      "But a year after Italy\u2019s worst drought in seven decades \u2014 when much of Europe gasped for precipitation \u2014 a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country\u2019s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not Moses,\u201d she responded.",
      "This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls \u201cLeonardesque\u201d ferries has become a stationary landmark.",
      "\u201cIf it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,\u201d said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago\u2019s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was \u201cthe family jewel of the town \u2014 we cannot be left without it.\u201d",
      "The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was \u201cevidence of a global problem.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.\u201d",
      "But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry\u2019s immobility since May.",
      "\u201cBureaucracy,\u201d said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.",
      "Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.",
      "The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn\u2019t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals \u2014 \u201cYou should see the hair on this guy,\u201d he said, cupping the phone \u2014 remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.",
      "\u201cI mean Leonardo wasn\u2019t a moron,\u201d he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s to scale; it\u2019s worth 500 euros,\u201d or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.",
      "\u201cThe force of the ferry is these,\u201d Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.",
      "What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring \u201cThe Human Face of the Ferry\u201d and its pilots over the past century. \u201cHarvard, Harvard, Harvard,\u201d Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. \u201cThey all went to Harvard.\u201d",
      "Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.",
      "\u201cI thought with my license I could do it,\u201d Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo\u2019s sketch and an excerpt from Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d about Charon, \u201cferryman of the damned.\u201d",
      "A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association \u2014 which has the ferry as its logo \u2014 Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really long process,\u201d said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.",
      "In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.",
      "Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant \u201cwe will suffer this summer.\u201d",
      "Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and \u201ckeep the tap closed\u201d to ensure the lake\u2019s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area\u2019s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.",
      "Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where \u201cI found a lot of dead fish.\u201d",
      "Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo\u2019s \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of that is usually covered with water,\u201d Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. \u201cIn 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen the river like this.\u201d",
      "Near Imbersago\u2019s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.",
      "\u201cThere used to be people in the piazza,\u201d he said, as the iron hissed. \u201cThose times are finished.\u201d",
      "Evening fell and the day\u2019s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s months that it doesn\u2019t rain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.\u201d",
      "Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s two drops,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d"

      "BORNE SULINOWO, Poland \u2014 Set in a thick forest, ringed by limpid lakes and free of violent crime, the town of Borne Sulinowo in northwestern Poland has undeniable bucolic charm \u2014 except for the ghosts on every eerily quiet street of the Nazi and then Soviet soldiers who built it.",
      "Governed for the past three decades by Poland, the town was controlled by and part of Germany before World War II; seized by the Red Army in 1945; and occupied by Moscow\u2019s forces until 1992. For a time, it embraced its dark side, eager to attract visitors and money to a forlorn and formerly forbidden zone so secret it did not appear on maps.",
      "Military re-enactors, including enthusiasts from Germany and Russia, visited each year to stage a parade, dressed in Soviet and Nazi uniforms, which are banned from public display in Germany.",
      "A Polish businessman opened the Russia Hotel, decorating it with photographs of himself and a friend dressed in Russian military uniforms and with communist-era banners embroidered with images of Lenin. His other ventures in the town included a cafe named after Rasputin and boozy, Russia-themed corporate events.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion of Ukraine stopped all that. Kitsch became offensively creepy.",
      "\u201cEverything changed very quickly,\u201d said Monika Konieczna-Pilszek, the manager of the Russia Hotel and daughter of its founder. Online reviews, she said, suddenly went from \u201ccommenting on our food to talking about burning us down.\u201d",
      "She told her father they had to change the name. \u201cInstead of attracting people it was repelling them,\u201d she said. The inn is now called the Borne Sulinowo Guesthouse. A big Soviet banner hung in the hallway next to its restaurant has been turned round so Lenin is no longer visible.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to be reminded of Russia these days,\u201d Ms. Koniecnza-Pilszek said.",
      "Dariusz Tederko, a local official responsible for promoting the town, lamented that the war in Ukraine \u201chas turned everything upside down.\u201d The military re-enactors, he said, are no longer welcome. The Russians couldn\u2019t come anyway because of a government ban.",
      "Trying to draw more Poles and Western Europeans, he now promotes the town\u2019s less triggering charms. \u201cWe have lots of beautiful heather,\u201d he said, waving a brochure with pictures of hiking trails and wildflowers.",
      "But he misses the prewar days when Russia was \u201cnot so sensitive,\u201d and Borne Sulinowo did not have to feel ashamed about the one thing that set it apart from countless other places in Poland offering pleasant scenery and pretty flowers.",
      "He said he was still in touch with retired Russian soldiers, including one now working in the Kremlin, who served here during the Cold War and who used to return regularly for trips down memory lane.",
      "Unlike many Poles, residents of Borne Sulinowo often harbor little personal animosity toward Russians. They are appalled by the bloodshed in Ukraine but blame Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.",
      "During the Soviet era, the town \u2014 home to more than 10,000 soldiers of the Northern Group of Forces \u2014 was a world unto itself, scrubbed from maps and off limits to Poles without special entry passes, though many still sneaked in to buy food and vodka.",
      "Renata Szmurlo, a nurse who grew up in a Polish town near the Soviet zone and moved to Borne Sulinowo with her family after the Russians left, recalled a carefree youth of cycling past military checkpoints with her friends to visit the town\u2019s shops. They accepted Polish currency but, stocked with supplies from Moscow for Soviet officers, had more goods than Polish ones.",
      "\u201cThe Russians were great guys,\u201d she recalled.",
      "When the town was part of Germany, Hitler visited, arriving by train in 1938 to inspect what was then a secret military training ground, set up in the forest so that Nazi commanders could furtively practice the blitzkrieg tactics that, just a year later, would plunge Poland and then the rest of Europe into World War II.",
      "\u201cIf you just look at the trees and buildings, everything here looks OK, but if you know the history of this place it makes your skin crawl,\u201d said Dariusz Czerniawski, a former teacher who moved to Borne Sulinowo shortly after the last Russians pulled out. They left a ghost town of empty, dilapidated barracks, suddenly silent shooting ranges and fields rutted with tank tracks.",
      "After a year under the control of the Polish army, Borne Sulinowo reappeared on maps in 1993 as just another Polish town, inhabited by a few early pioneers like Mr. Czerniawski. \u201cIt was so quiet, I wanted to scream,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe silence and emptiness were terrifying.\u201d",
      "Over time, more Poles arrived, attracted by cheap housing and the chance for a fresh start. The town now has nearly 5,000 year-round residents and many more people during the summer. It still feels empty and isolated.",
      "The main road \u2014 Adolf Hitler Strasse during the Nazi period and Stalin Avenue after 1945 \u2014 is now Independence Street.",
      "Lined with gimcrack Soviet apartment blocks intermingled with sturdy villas left by the Germans, it has a few shops, a defunct pizza place and the Sasha Cafe, run by a Russian-speaking man from eastern Ukraine, who first came here as a young photographer working for the Soviet military command.",
      "A target of suspicious whispering by locals and scrutiny by Polish authorities, he recently put his property up for sale.",
      "Mr. Czerniawski, the early pioneer, today runs the town\u2019s museum and has spent a lot of time thinking about how to deal with the past.",
      "\u201cIt would perhaps be easier to demolish the whole town,\u201d he said, \u201cBut what would that give us \u2014 just a big empty space with no memory of anything?\u201d",
      "Borne Sulinowo, he believes, needs to survive as a \u201cunique place built by the two most brutal totalitarian systems of the last century\u201d \u2014 and as a reminder of where such systems lead. \u201cUsually to war,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe have to remember our bad past so that we can learn something for the future,\u201d he said.",
      "He has resisted suggestions to remove from the museum a mannequin dressed in a Russian military uniform and has rejected demands that the Soviet-designed tank opposite the entrance be taken away. Some residents threatened to destroy it.",
      "But the tank, Mr. Czerniawski noted, was put there",
      "by Polish authorities, who took it from a Warsaw military museum. \u201cIt is Soviet design but was made in Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is part of our history \u2014 perhaps not the glorious history we would like \u2014 but it is ours,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cEntry Categorically Forbidden. Danger of death or disability,\u201d read signs put up in front of the crumbling, weed-clogged bunkers.",
      "Until the warheads were taken back to Russia in 1990 as the Soviet Union unraveled, they were part of the Vistula Program, a top-secret deployment of nuclear weapons in Poland that began in the 1960s. Throughout the Cold War, Moscow insisted it had no nuclear weapons in Poland while accusing the United States of threatening peace by putting its own warheads in Europe.",
      "For Jan Chmielowski, a Pole who first visited Borne Sulinowo in 1994 and \u201cimmediately fell in love with this strange place,\u201d the Soviet past was for years \u201cjust a big sad joke\u201d because everything left by the Russians seemed to be falling apart.",
      "He bought an old German villa, turned it into a guesthouse and, inspired by the Russia Hotel next door, began organizing corporate team-building events featuring vodka, surly Soviet-style service and mock arrests by fake Russian officers with guns. He has dropped that and now organizes French-themed events with champagne and without weapons.",
      "\u201cEverything Russian stopped being funny after the war in Ukraine,\u201d he lamented."

      "The kings and queens of London\u2019s lesser-known royal family gathered outside a church in Covent Garden on a recent Sunday afternoon dressed in their sparkly finery.",
      "But their jewels of choice were not diamonds or rubies. They were\u00a0buttons made of mother-of-pearl that covered their jet-black suits and hats in intricate patterns, sewn by hand into elaborate designs that glitter in the sunlight.",
      "These are the Pearly Kings and Queens of London \u2014 keepers of a tradition that began in the Victorian era, was passed down through generations of families and became a symbol of the city\u2019s working-class, Cockney culture. They see themselves as custodians of a waning way of life, which they carry on by singing Cockney songs, sharing Cockney stories and, crucially, collecting money for good causes.",
      "Modern pearlies, grouped by geographic area of London, have organized themselves into a few charitable groups and, like the better-known royal family, have at times feuded. But the pearlies argue over which group ",
      ".",
      "Once a month, some pearlies\u00a0rattle blue plastic buckets to collect charity donations at Covent Garden, a former market turned tourist draw, in London\u2019s West End.",
      "\u201cMost Londoners know about the Pearly Kings and Queens,\u201d said John Walters, 75, who holds the title of Pearly King of Finsbury, an area of north London. \u201cI had an elderly lady come up here and she grabbed hold of me and she started crying and said, \u2018I\u2019m so pleased to see you\u2019re still around.\u2019 She said, \u2018You are London.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tourists, though, are often pleasantly\u00a0surprised\u00a0to encounter them.",
      "On a bright March morning, Mr. Walters and Clive Bennett, 68, the Pearly King of Woolwich, in the city\u2019s southeast, were approached by a group of young women \u2014 one wearing a \u201cbride to be\u201d sash \u2014 who asked for a photograph. The men, in Cockney accents, instantly broke into a rendition of \u201cGet Me to the Church on Time\u201d from \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d as the women erupted in laughter and threw a few pounds into their buckets. The men tipped their flat caps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real honor to be able to do something like this actually, and it\u2019s fun,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cYou meet all sorts of people.\u201d",
      "He was invited to take part in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics and took part in events on the sidelines of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s jubilee and funeral.",
      "The over-the-top outfits that the pearlies are known for \u2014 with the back of their clothing bearing their august titles in bold lettering \u2014 are as peculiar as they are eye-catching, with feathers, shine and patterns assaulting the eyes. The idea for the finery grew from the tradition in\u00a0Cockney culture of\u00a0thumbing noses at London society\u2019s disdainful view of the lower classes.",
      "For Mr. Bennett, and many others, being a pearly is a family affair. His wife, Kim, 66, is a Pearly Queen and his daughter and grandchildren take part in fund-raising\u00a0events, as well, under the title of Pearly Princesses and Princes.",
      "Like most royal families, pearlies typically inherit their titles or marry into the tradition. But others, like the Bennetts, have been invited in because of their commitment to community work and charity.",
      "\u201cToday, there is a need for us now more than ever, \u201d Ms. Bennett said, as she pointed to the\u00a0inflationary pressures on many local\u00a0communities.",
      "Henry Croft \u2014 an orphan and a London street sweeper \u2014 is considered the first Pearly King. In the late 1870s, he\u00a0became known for covering his clothing with mother-of-pearl buttons to draw attention as he collected money for hospitals and orphanages.",
      "Mr. Croft was said to have taken his fashion inspiration from costermongers, who were roving traders selling fruit, vegetables, fish and produce on the streets of east London, a working-class area that developed its own distinct accent and vocabulary riddled with rhyming slang, known as Cockney.",
      "The costermongers sewed buttons onto their clothes to distinguish themselves and to mimic the rich, ",
      ". These coster communities would elect a leader in their local area to keep the peace and collect money to support fellow traders down on their luck.",
      "\u201cIf someone\u2019s fruit went off, or the donkey was ill, or something like that,\u201d said Mr. Bennett, describing how the costermongers would have a singalong and pass around a bucket for donations. \u201cI think that\u2019s where Henry Croft got his whole ethos from.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Croft took his pearly suits and generosity to a new level, putting on his dazzling button suit as he gathered money for the poor and the sick.",
      "Others soon joined him. At the time of Mr. Croft\u2019s funeral in 1930, dozens of pearlies from across London joined the cortege to honor him, ",
      ".",
      "While London lore holds that to be a true Cockney, a person must be born within earshot of Bow Bells, which ring from ",
      " in east London, pearly titles are now held by people from communities across all of London\u2019s boroughs.",
      "While some pearly traditions have shifted, the rules on the buttons themselves have stayed consistent: They must be true mother-of-pearl, not imitation. Generally, they are passed down through families.",
      "\u201cA lot of the buttons are over 100 years old on there,\u201d said David Hemsley, 60, describing the jacket he inherited from his father.",
      "In Covent Garden, after a few hours of cheekily delivering rhyming Cockney slang to curious crowds and singing old tunes with gusto while collecting donations, the pearlies make their way into the nearby St. Paul\u2019s Church to hold their monthly meeting.",
      "\u201cCome on then, let\u2019s go!\u201d\u00a0Doreen Golding, 83, the Pearly Queen of Bow Bells and the Old Kent Road, shouted to the group as she led the way to the church vestry.",
      "As the chairwoman of London\u2019s Pearly Kings and Queens Society, Ms. Golding was honored by the late queen for her charity efforts. She said the pearlies would continue to wear their buttons and keep up their charitable giving for as long as there was a need.",
      "\u201cI get upset when someone says, \u2018Oh, are you still around? We didn\u2019t think there was any more of you left,\u2019\u201d Ms. Golding said with a laugh. \u201cAnd I think, \u2018Now hang on, open your bloody eyes and look, we are here!\u2019\u201d"

      "A mural depicting Queen Elizabeth II in a yoga pose, with the message \u201cWelcome to Bristol,\u201d greets visitors to this vibrant city in southwestern England.",
      "But like so many other places in Britain, devotion to the monarchy in Bristol runs hot and cold. So as the coronation of ",
      " on Saturday approaches, views of the royal family fluctuate from apathy \u2014 even disdain \u2014 among young people in Bohemian cafes and music shops to respect for the history and tradition of royalty among older Britons on the outskirts of town.",
      "\u201cIt's excuse after excuse as to why we should have them at all, but the public is always afraid of change,\u201d said Ewan Search, who works at Cafe Kino, a vegan outfit and community space in Bristol. \u201cThey are really nothing but mannequins for robes and jewels.\u201d",
      "Jaydie Pomphrey, 23, said she was just happy to have an excuse for a barbecue. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about it personally,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they actually represent?\u201d",
      "She was among those gathered enjoying the spring weather outside a cluster of pubs on King Street over the weekend, many of whom said they weren\u2019t even sure what day the coronation was being held.",
      "But the vibe was decidedly different across town in Shirehampton, a part of northwestern Bristol that feels more like a village, as residents gathered at a community hall the week before the coronation.",
      "Laminated photos of King Charles adorned market tables set up around the hall where locals mingled and shopped. The mayor cut an elaborately decorated coronation cake, and a local dance troupe performed, bangles and glittering gowns jingling.",
      "\u201cI guess we didn\u2019t realize how important it was,\u201d said Marilyn Gorry, 82. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you are older that you realize how important it is.\u201d",
      "That generational divide goes a long way toward explaining the substantial split in public opinion in Bristol and across the nation about the role the monarchy plays in a modern Britain \u2014 one that looks decidedly different from when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in the middle of the 20th century.",
      "Many younger Britons question the need for a monarchy at all, while others, who tend to be older and often more conservative, say the nation needs to hold on to a longstanding institution.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t think it really resonates with a lot of people here anymore,\u201d said Ffion Eyron, 22, who studies in Bristol and works in a vintage shop.",

      "Most of the youngest cohort of people surveyed \u2014 59 percent \u2014 said that King Charles was out of touch with the experiences of the British public, and 34 percent of those over 65 felt that way. There was a similar divide when it came to interest in the royal family, with 78 percent of the youngest group surveyed saying it had none.",
      "The generational divide is particularly stark in Bristol, which has a median age of around 34, younger than the national average, 40. It is also increasingly diverse, with 28.4 percent of the population from an ethnic minority group, according to the last census.",
      "Vintage shops, art galleries and independent cafes dominate the streetscape of the decidedly hipster Stokes Croft neighborhood. Elsewhere, the youthful and bohemian identity of the city mingles with reminders of the rich, though sometimes problematic, industrial heritage that allowed the city to flourish.",
      "Rosie Weston, who soaked up the afternoon sun with two friends last weekend, said she was just grateful for an additional public holiday, while her friends described the royal ritual as \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201ca waste of money.\u201d",
      "The three said that they had no plans to mark King Charles III\u2019s crowning, and that they disagreed with the very notion of one rich family still wielding power and influence in the modern era.",

      "Her group launched into an impassioned discussion of the legacy of the British Empire, its involvement in the slave trade \u2014 especially relevant in a city like Bristol \u2014 ",
      "The city docks, just steps away, ",
      " of enslaved African people, and Caribbean products such as sugar, rum, indigo and cocoa produced by the enslaved were brought to Bristol and fueled local industries, enriching British merchants from this port city.",
      "In recent years, the city has begun to reckon with that troubled history, and in 2020, a statue of Edward Colston, a slave trader who became a wealthy benefactor of the city, was ",
      ". As the nation reckons with its colonial past, there has been growing skepticism of institutions like the royal family that profited, particularly among young people.",
      "Ashleigh Fielding, 29, a small-business owner who makes plantable seed greeting cards, said that the cost of the lavish celebration was the most troubling aspect, and that the funds could be better spent elsewhere in a country struggling with a cost-of-living crisis.",
      "\u201cThe prices for pretty much everything here is going through the roof,\u201d Ms. Fielding said. \u201cAnd then to hear how much the coronation is costing of taxpayers money \u2014 especially as someone trying to run a small business \u2014 it\u2019s a struggle.\u201d",
      "Bristol will offer counterprogramming to the coronation, as it has for recent royal events. One independent cinema and community space, the Cube, is hosting an anti-coronation street party and discussion called \u201cWhat Are We Celebrating,\u201d as well as an evening of dancing at the \u201cBig Gay Diana Party,\u201d described as \u201can event for the more outgoing critics of the monarchy.\u201d",
      "Of course, there are many in Bristol who are enthusiastic about the pomp and pageantry of the coronation, some of whom had already begun marking the festivities a week in advance, including those at the Shirehampton community hall.",
      "Ms. Gorry, who described herself as a royalist, remembers being a young girl during Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s coronation in 1953. She was born during World War II and said that in the years after the war, there was a real desire to have something to celebrate.",
      "Neighbors and friends had all gathered around the small television in her home, then still a rarity in many households.",
      "\u201cThe royal family, when I was a young girl, they were everything, and now it\u2019s different,\u201d she said, adding that Elizabeth was a more unifying figure than Charles.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have so many people excited about the coronation now,\u201d she added. \u201cThere is that feeling of being a bit more removed.\u201d",

      "A few weeks ago, Ahmed al-Hassan was a medical student in Sudan working on a campaign to help refugees from a neighboring country. Then, the forces of two rival generals went to battle in the streets of the capital, Khartoum, and he was forced to flee himself.",
      "He left behind his home, his textbooks and the paperwork proving he was a student \u2014 stuffing basic necessities into a suitcase and a backpack \u2014 to escape with his ailing mother from the bullets, warplanes and shelling.",
      "After a harrowing 14-hour bus ride across the country, they arrived in the seaside city of Port Sudan, where thousands of Sudanese and foreigners have gathered in hopes of catching a boat or a plane out of the country.",
      "Standing in a line of evacuees waiting on Wednesday to board a ship to Saudi Arabia \u2014 a 10-hour voyage across the Red Sea \u2014 Mr. al-Hassan, 21, said he knew that he was one of a lucky few Sudanese with the connections to find a way out of the conflict tearing his country apart. He was born in Saudi Arabia and has legal residency there, giving him and his mother access to the evacuation efforts overseen by the Saudis.",
      "\u201cIt was a golden opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Port Sudan, there are so many people who want to leave; it was a 1 percent chance for something like this to happen for me.\u201d",
      "The Saudis have sent naval ships and chartered commercial vessels on more than a dozen trips across the Red Sea, evacuating nearly 6,000 people so far, fewer than 250 of them Saudi citizens. A Times reporter traveled aboard one such naval ship from Port Sudan to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a group of evacuees fleeing to safety.",
      "The vessel was enormous and gray, with a labyrinth of interior corridors bathed in white and red lights. Evacuees curled up in sleeping bags on the floor and on couches in the mess hall, fighting off the effects of seasickness as the boat gently swayed across the sea. In the morning, they staggered out to the deck for fresh air, where the sun beat down on deep blue waves.",
      "Crew members periodically recited the Islamic call to prayer over loudspeakers, with the ship\u2019s navigators directing worshipers on how to face toward the ever-shifting coordinates of Mecca.",
      "While they are seeking refuge, the vast majority of the evacuees on this route would not be classified as refugees; the Saudi authorities say they can take only those who have citizenship or legal residency in the kingdom, or plans to travel onward.",
      "Yet Saudi Arabia, one of the closest countries to Sudan with the means to manage evacuations, has played a central role in extricating people from the northeast African nation since the violence erupted in mid-April.",
      "There is a large Sudanese migrant population in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi officials have relationships with both of the warring generals, viewing Sudan\u2019s stability as crucial to regional security. And the kingdom is a member of the four-member diplomatic group, known as the Quad, which recently oversaw the failed efforts to have Sudan transition to civilian-led rule.",
      "The Saudi rescue mission also fits neatly with efforts by the oil-rich kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to portray his country as a rising global power and himself as a benevolent international actor and a neutral mediator.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the kingdom of humanity,\u201d Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Dubais of Saudi Arabia told a group of Chinese, Sudanese and Saudi evacuees as they arrived at the port in Jeddah on Wednesday, swarmed by television cameras and accompanied by Fayez al-Malki, a Saudi actor who shared their entire journey with 4.3 million subscribers on Snapchat.",
      "When they disembarked from the ship via a gangway, female Saudi soldiers handed them roses. The ships will continue to retrieve evacuees as long as the journey is safe, a Saudi military spokesman said.",
      "More than 100,000 people have fled Sudan in less than three weeks since the fighting broke out, and over 300,000 have been displaced internally, U.N. agencies said on Tuesday. ",
      "Port Sudan, controlled by the Sudanese Army, has become a refuge as fighting rages in Khartoum. ",
      "Early Wednesday, tugboats laden with evacuees zipped across the water to Saudi naval ships. Dozens of men, women and children with dazed eyes waited quietly in two lines as Saudi soldiers inspected their bulging suitcases.",
      "Departing was the H.M.S. Mecca, with roughly 200",
      "evacuees, including Rihab Mahdi, 45, a Sudanese mother of five whose family had been able to secure passage because her husband worked for years as a security officer for the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum.",
      "\u201cThere are very few chances and a lot of people,\u201d she said. Despite feeling lucky, she was overcome by sorrow at leaving her home, tossing schoolbooks out of her 7-year-old son\u2019s backpack \u2014 \u201cthe best part,\u201d he declared \u2014 and filling it with pajamas and a other items of clothing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing to leave your country, your family, your friends,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked why they could not bring more Sudanese evacuees, a Saudi military spokesman, Col. Turki al-Maliki, said that the kingdom\u2019s authorities were exerting \u201cmaximum effort\u201d but that certain requirements remained. As they arrive in Port Sudan, he said, priority is given to older people, women and children.",
      "In Khartoum on Wednesday, the Sudanese Army, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, continued to fight, even as the army ",
      " that it would agree to extend the current truce by one week, and ",
      " affirmed their \u201cfull commitment to the declared humanitarian truce.\u201d",
      "The statements came a day after neighboring South Sudan announced that both generals had ",
      " and would name representatives to peace talks. But no date for negotiations was set, and previously truces have collapsed.",
      "Residents of Khartoum woke up on Wednesday to heavy blasts and gunfire close to their homes, with warplanes circling the city and shelling some targets as early as 5 a.m. By noon, clashes were ongoing in neighborhoods close to the city\u2019s international airport, one resident said.",
      "\u201cThe Sudanese are facing a humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, said in a speech in Nairobi, Kenya. \u201cHospitals destroyed. Humanitarian warehouses looted. Millions facing food insecurity.\u201d",
      "Even as he was fleeing, Mr. al-Hassan, the medical student, said his thoughts were with those less fortunate, including Yemeni and Syrian refugees who had been living in Sudan and could be displaced\u00a0again.",

      "GLOUCESTER, England \u2014 The coronation of King Charles III and Camilla, the queen consort, on Saturday will involve many of the same ancient traditions that have been followed for nearly a thousand years. But some things will be new: The royal horse-drawn carriage will have air-conditioning. There will be an official coronation emoji issued by Buckingham Palace.",
      "And, in a break with eight centuries of culinary tradition, a pie for the newly crowned monarch has been baked not with lampreys \u2014 slimy, jawless, eel-like fish with a single nostril \u2014 but with pork.",
      "At a ceremony on Thursday in the city of Gloucester, about 100 miles northwest of London, Mayor Howard Hyman presented the pie to a representative for the king. Instead of actual lampreys, whose numbers\u00a0in Britain\u00a0have dwindled, the pie was decorated with two pastry lampreys. A third pastry lamprey had fallen off.",
      "Charles\u2019s representative, Lord-Lieutenant Edward Gillespie, accepted the pie on behalf of the king and donated it to a local charity focusing on hunger. He said that it was right that the tradition had been updated. \u201cIt would be inappropriate in these times to present lampreys to anybody,\u201d Lord-Lieutenant Gillespie said after the ceremony. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said of the king.",
      "While some in Gloucester lamented the change in tradition, many said it made sense to substitute pork for lamprey to reflect changing tastes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not particularly fussed at what\u2019s in the pie,\u201d Alan Myatt, the town crier, said at the ceremony, which about 100 people attended at the Folk of Gloucester museum, a building constructed in the 1500s. \u201cThe most important thing is we\u2019re commemorating and celebrating the coronation by presenting a pie.\u201d He applauded Gloucester for coming together to carry on the tradition. \u201cGod save the king!\u201d the crowd chanted.",
      "The tradition of supplying the monarch with lampreys dates to at least the late 12th century, when lampreys, then plentiful in the\u00a0local\u00a0River Severn, were served at royal banquets and feasts, said Andrew Armstrong, an archaeologist for the Gloucester City Council. Even earlier, in 1135, King Henry I died after eating too many lampreys, according to \u201cThe History of the English People 1000-1154,\u201d by Henry of Huntingdon, the 12th-century Anglo-Norman historian.",
      "In 1200, King John fined the men of Gloucester 40 marks \u2014 a significant sum at the time \u2014 for failing to deliver a lamprey pie. John\u2019s son, King Henry III, was also a big fan, and his household accounts show entries of payments for lamprey orders for him and for his wife, Eleanor, Queen of England, according to the short book \u201cRoyal Lamprey Pie of Gloucester,\u201d published in 1953.",
      "In the past, lampreys were marinated in red wine or salt and then roasted with spices, ",
      ", a charity that manages historic buildings in England. By the 18th century, the lamprey pie recipe included lemons, Mr. Armstrong said.",
      "Queen Elizabeth II received several lamprey pies over her 70-year reign, though it was unclear whether she ever sampled any of them.",
      "Robin Start, 96, who attended the ceremony in Gloucester on Thursday, was among a group of war veterans who delivered a 42-pound lamprey pie to Windsor Castle for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in 1953. Lampreys are \u201chorrible, horrible things,\u201d Mr. Start said, describing how they latch on to other fish and suck their blood. \u201cWould you want to eat a fish like that?\u201d",
      "Charles most likely would not. A longtime environmentalist, he has spoken out against overfishing and said in a BBC interview\u00a0in 2021\u00a0that he ",
      ". The official dish for the coronation, ",
      ", is a vegetarian quiche made of spinach, tarragon, cheese and fava beans. ",
      " at street and garden parties that will take place across Britain over the long coronation weekend, which begins on Saturday.",
      "While lampreys have fallen out of fashion in Britain, they are still eaten in parts of Europe. The Portuguese town of ",
      " holds an annual lamprey festival, in which gourmands descend on the city to sample lampreys, which are prepared by boiling them in their own blood.",
      "Other culinary traditions long popular with European nobility persist today. ",
      ", a tiny songbird whose dwindling numbers caused the government to forbid its sale. Diners consume the bird ",
      " while covering their heads with white napkins\u00a0to hide their sin from God (and to savor the aroma). Former President ",
      " before he died in 1996 included the rare and illegal ortolan.",
      "Eating lamprey in Britain is not illegal, but catching one requires permission from the British government. The city of Gloucester used lampreys in pies for Elizabeth in 2012 and 2015, though the lampreys were imported from Canada, where they were considered pests and a threat to local trout populations.",
      "While Gloucester officials said",
      "it was no longer appropriate to ship lampreys from Canada, given Charles\u2019s focus on sustainability, the tradition could potentially be brought back\u00a0if conservation efforts in England are successful.",
      "\u201cIf we can restore them, they\u2019ll no longer be an endangered species,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said, \u201cand we\u2019ll be happier about putting them in pies.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s good to be the king. But it\u2019s not without its traps, as King Charles III learned last weekend when the organizers of his coronation invited millions of Britons to pledge an oath of homage to the monarch during the ceremony on Saturday.",
      "\u201cA spectacular misjudgment,\u201d said Graham Smith, whose group, Republic, wants to abolish the monarchy. \u201cDiscordant and potentially tone deaf,\u201d posted Anna Whitelock, an expert on the monarchy at City, University of London. \u201cMore like the stuff of a Stalinist people\u2019s republic,\u201d wrote the columnist Mick Hume.",
      "The archbishop of Canterbury, the Most. Rev. Justin Welby, who will preside over the service, insisted that the oath would be purely voluntary. It was meant as a democratizing gesture: At Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s coronation in 1953, only members of the hereditary aristocracy swore allegiance.",
      "Such are the problems vexing Charles as he prepares for his coronation, Britain\u2019s first in 70 years. In the seven months since he ascended the throne, royal watchers say, the new king has worked to make the monarchy more accessible, forward looking and inclusive. Yet ",
      " are a reminder of how \u2014 in a secular, multiethnic, digital-age society \u2014 the crown is fundamentally an anachronism.",
      "As Buckingham Palace dusts off its royal relics \u2014 gleaming swords and scepters, a bejeweled orb and gold stage coach \u2014 Charles, 74, is walking a tightrope between tradition and modernity. People who know him say he knows he must adapt the institution to a society that has not necessarily turned against the idea of a king, but ",
      ".",
      "His partner in this project is his 40-year-old son and heir, Prince William. The two have grown close after the painful rift between them and Charles\u2019s younger son, ",
      " according to those who know them. They form the nucleus of a shrunken royal family, one that its defenders say will make fewer demands on Britain\u2019s public purse.",
      "\u201cUnder Charles and William, they\u2019re going to work even harder to be relevant,\u201d said Paddy Harverson, who served as communications secretary to Charles from 2003 to 2014. \u201cHe will want to manage spending more carefully and produce a more cost-efficient monarchy. He\u2019s got a license to change things, but it will be gradual.\u201d",
      "Critics warn that public attitudes are changing faster than the monarchy. In a recent poll by the market research firm YouGov, 58 percent of people said Britain should continue to have a king, while 26 percent said it should have an elected head of state. But among those aged 18 to 24, fewer than a third favored keeping it.",
      "\u201cThey are completely underestimating the change in the public mood,\u201d said Catherine Mayer, who wrote a 2015 biography, \u201cCharles: The Heart of a King.\u201d \u201cWhat we are witnessing is not the end of the monarchy,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat we are witnessing is the end of the popular monarchy.\u201d",
      "Part of the problem is Charles himself. He has evolved, ",
      ", from a gawky youth to a self-assured elder statesman. But he remains, in Ms. Mayer\u2019s words, a \u201cMarmite figure,\u201d either loved or hated \u2014 much like the salty brown English spread that is marketed as the ultimate acquired taste.",
      "That sets him apart from Queen Elizabeth, who was revered as a unifying figure, serenely operating above politics, a timeless counterweight to the daily upheavals of Britain\u2019s parliamentary democracy.",
      "In his brief reign, Charles has already found himself drawn messily into politics. In February, he welcomed the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to Windsor Castle, just hours after she signed an agreement with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to settle a trade dispute in Northern Ireland.",
      "Opponents of the deal said the king ",
      ". Downing Street labeled it the Windsor Framework, which some said improperly put the king\u2019s imprimatur on the agreement, since Windsor is not only one of the king\u2019s homes but his family name.",
      "Last fall, days after he ascended the throne, Charles reluctantly yielded to advice from Mr. Sunak\u2019s predecessor, Liz Truss, not to attend the United Nations\u2019 climate change conference in Egypt, despite his longstanding commitment to climate and environmental issues.",
      "These episodes capture the challenge Charles will face ",
      ": He is fervently committed to causes from organic farming to traditional architecture. He reads voraciously, aides say, and approaches public debates with the instincts of a contrarian. A former aide, Mark Bolland, once described him as a \u201cdissident working against the prevailing political consensus.\u201d",
      "Experts on the monarchy predicted Charles would find other ways to channel his activism. Some predicted he would promote fine arts \u2014 classical music and the works of Shakespeare are particular passions, they said \u2014 more than the queen, whose outside interests ran mainly to breeding racehorses.",
      "\u201cHe takes a view even more strongly than the queen that the monarchy has to be shown to be useful,\u201d said Vernon Bogdanor, an authority on the constitutional monarchy. \u201cHe will use his soft power to a great extent.\u201d",
      "Charles\u2019s diplomatic outreach got off to an awkward start when the king played host at a state banquet for President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, one of the Commonwealth nations. A week later, Mr. Ramaphosa faced an impeachment vote on charges of money laundering (which he survived).",
      "But ",
      ", a three-day visit to Germany, with the queen consort, Camilla, won rapturous headlines. Speaking to the Parliament in Berlin, Charles, who has German forebears, switched seamlessly from English to German as he stressed the solidarity between Britain and Germany in defending Ukraine from Russia.",
      "His choice of Europe was no accident. It was clearly intended, in the wake of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, to build on a diplomatic rapprochement between Mr. Sunak and President Emmanuel Macron. Visiting Germany in 2020, Charles said, \u201cNo country is really an island\u201d \u2014 the closest he ever came to publicly criticizing Brexit.",
      "Still, the king\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d has its limits, even in the Commonwealth. Britain\u2019s former colonies are increasingly chafing at the monarch\u2019s role as their head of state, and with the death of the much-admired queen, Jamaica and others are determined to throw off their links to the royal family.",
      "Nor is Charles ever likely to match the popularity of his mother at home. In a YouGov poll in early 2023, the queen, who died last September, was viewed favorably by 80 percent of respondents. Charles was viewed favorably by 55 percent, putting him behind his sister, Princess Anne; William; and his daughter-in-law, Catherine.",
      "Those numbers are well ahead of most British political leaders, and far better than they were in 1996, after Charles\u2019s failed marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales. At that time, his public reputation crashed so badly that many Britons said they would prefer to see the crown skip a generation to William.",
      "But Charles continues to be saddled with fallout from the palace\u2019s bitter split with Harry and his wife, Meghan, which was stoked by Harry\u2019s memoir and its tell-all accounts of the family\u2019s quarreling.",
      "\u201cThe revelations about the king\u2019s relationship with his second son have overshadowed what the king is trying to do in the United Kingdom,\u201d said Ed Owens, a historian who writes about relations between the monarchy and the media. \u201cThe tabloid press has been preoccupied by this story of celebrity rather than the more difficult question of how the monarchy is going to evolve.\u201d",
      "Some say the rift with Harry and Meghan deprived the royal family of its last, best chance to modernize its image. While William and Catherine remain popular, Ms. Mayer noted, they are edging into middle age, no longer progressive figures but parents who embody tradition and conservative values.",
      "Charles has yet to make a strategic move to define his reign, royal watchers said. In his public appearances, he remains the same figure he was as Prince of Wales \u2014 more down-to-earth than the queen, more apt to dwell on subjects that seize his imagination, like the export of grain out of Ukraine, which dominated a visit he made last year to a charity that helps resettle Ukrainian refugees.",
      "The oath the archbishop announced last weekend, termed the \u201chomage of the people,\u201d grew out of an effort by the palace to make the coronation more relevant and ecumenical \u2014 no mean feat for a ceremony whose rituals go back to the crowning of King Edgar in A.D. 973 in the Roman city of Bath.",
      "Leaders of non-Christian faiths like Judaism, Buddhism, and Sikhism will present the king with items of regalia and will greet him before he leaves Westminster Abbey. The archbishop will offer a preamble that nods to other religious traditions.",
      "By encouraging the public to take part in a ritual once reserved for nobility, the palace was clearly hoping to open up the ceremony. It also would showcase the breadth of public support for Charles. But at a time when young people are tuning out the monarchy, expecting them to swear an oath to a king seemed out of touch.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an appetite for change,\u201d Ms. Mayer said, \u201cand they\u2019re still trying to do business as usual.\u201d"

      "The golden sand of Bikini Atoll is laced with plutonium. The freshwater is poisoned with strontium. The coconut crabs contain hazardous levels of cesium.",
      "In the 1940s and \u201950s, the U.S. government used this coral reef, in the Pacific nation of the Marshall Islands, for testing nuclear weapons. Radioactive residue has left Bikini uninhabitable to this day, forcing those whose families once lived on the atoll into exile on a handful of other Marshallese islands and in the United States.",
      "Recognizing the damage its testing caused, the U.S. government established two trust funds in the 1980s to help pay for Bikinians\u2019 health care, build housing and cover living costs. In 2017, after a campaign by Bikini leaders for greater autonomy, the Trump administration announced that the government would lift withdrawal limits and stop auditing the main fund, then worth $59 million.",
      "Six years later, only about $100,000 remains, and the Bikini community is in crisis.",
      "Anderson Jibas, the mayor of the council that oversees the displaced Bikini community, made a series of questionable purchases on Bikini\u2019s behalf, including of a large plot of land in Hawaii and a fleet of new vehicles. He has defended some of the purchases as investments against climate change, as necessary to support isolated Bikinians and as attempts at revenue-generating projects.",
      "Mr. Jibas has also acknowledged using trust fund money for personal expenses and has been accused by a top Marshall Islands official of receiving kickbacks from an investment manager \u2014 a charge Mr. Jibas denies.",
      "With the fund virtually depleted, the council\u2019s roughly 350 employees are no longer being paid. Monthly payments of about $150 each to the community\u2019s 6,800 members \u2014 a vital lifeline that helped cover food and rent among a population with high rates of poverty \u2014 have ceased.",
      "The emergency highlights the lasting consequences of decades of U.S. nuclear testing in the Pacific, including lingering questions about the American commitment to address that legacy, an undertaking made more difficult by pervasive fraud and mismanagement in the region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Tommy Jibok, a former member of the Bikini council who challenged Mr. Jibas in an election in 2019. \u201cThey told us we would be sitting and sleeping on money. Look what is happening now. We\u2019re sleeping on nothing.\u201d",
      "In 1946, the United States relocated the 167 inhabitants of Bikini to clear the way for nuclear tests that it said would \u201cend all world wars.\u201d It then left them virtually alone on a small, desolate island, where many nearly starved. In 1948, the islanders were moved again.",
      "Over 12 years, the United States tested 23 nuclear bombs in Bikini. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that the Bikinians would return home. But after scientists found that radiation levels remained dangerously high, the United States in 1978 evacuated the almost 150 people who had chosen to go back. The Marshall Islands gained independence from the United States the next year.",
      "In 1982, the American government established a $25 million resettlement fund to clean up Bikini and support its people. In 1987, it created a second fund to provide annual payments directly to Bikinians. A year later, it contributed an additional $90 million to the resettlement fund. American officials administered the money and could veto withdrawals.",
      "Bikini representatives argued that the resettlement fund contained too little money to remedy the atoll\u2019s radioactivity. They used the funds instead to support the exiled Bikinians.",
      "But the Bikini leaders were frustrated by American officials\u2019 refusal to release more than a few million dollars each year. The struggle culminated in 2016 with the election of Mr. Jibas, who promised to take control of the resettlement fund. (The other fund is overseen by independent trustees.)",
      "During a 2017 congressional hearing, Mr. Jibas explained that Bikinians \u201c\u200b\u200bknow far better than the intermediaries or distant agencies of the United States what is needed to make the lives of the displaced population more bearable.\u201d",
      ", at the time an assistant interior secretary, announced that the Interior Department would relinquish control of the resettlement fund to \u201crestore trust and ensure that sovereignty means something.\u201d",
      "Mr. Jibok, the former Bikini council member, had a different interpretation: that U.S. officials wanted to \u201cwash their hands clean\u201d of responsibility for Bikinians.",
      "Whatever the motivation, the result was a rapid increase in council spending under Mr. Jibas, from $7.6 million in 2016 to $25.7 million in 2018, according to audits from the time. Bank statements provided by Gordon Benjamin, a lawyer for the council, show that the fund, worth $59 million in 2017, was down to just $100,041 in March of this year.",
      "Many of the council\u2019s purchases were popular, including of a small aircraft and two cargo ships to help supply isolated Bikinians, as well as construction equipment to build protections against rising seas that threaten low-lying Pacific islands because of climate change.",
      "But there were also more dubious purchases: $4.8 million for 283 acres of land in Hawaii; $1.3 million for an apartment complex in the Marshall Islands\u2019 capital, Majuro; and multiple new vehicles for the personal use of Bikini council members, according to Mr. Benjamin. Mr. Jibas also introduced an annual $100,000 \u201crepresentation package\u201d to fund his regular trips to the United States.",
      "Mr. Jibas has said he wants to develop housing in Hawaii for rent or sale, but no development has taken place yet. The Majuro apartment complex was purchased as an investment property, but it appears to be losing money so far.",
      "Lani Kramer, a Bikinian who previously worked as the council\u2019s city manager and is now challenging Mr. Jibas for the mayoralty, said Mr. Jibas and council members had used public funds for personal spending. \u201cThey were bringing receipts for diapers, chewing gum,\u201d Ms. Kramer said. \u201cIt was obviously not for the people, it was for their own grocery shopping.\u201d",
      "The Marshall Islands\u2019 banking commissioner has also accused Mr. Jibas of accepting $50,000 from a local bank manager who is being prosecuted on suspicion of unlawfully investing Bikini funds and laundering money. The Marshallese auditor general did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations.",
      "Starting in 2018, Mr. Jibas refused to disclose council finances to the Marshall Islands\u2019 auditor general, prompting the police to seize council documents in 2021. Late last month, a spokesman for the Interior Department said it had written to bank officials seeking information about the fund and to Mr. Jibas requesting the council\u2019s recent budgets.",
      "That request came after Jack Niedenthal, an American expatriate who served as the Marshallese health secretary, wrote to the Interior Department warning about the depleted trust fund and asking the department to intervene. He was subsequently fired for breaching diplomatic protocol by circumventing the Marshallese foreign ministry and the American Embassy.",
      "Mr. Jibas acknowledged in an interview that he occasionally used his representation package to buy food and other items for his family, which he said council staff members were aware of and had approved, but he denied taking money from the bank manager.",
      "Mr. Jibas said in the interview that he was trying to access the independently controlled second fund, which now holds $28 million, to sustain council spending.",
      "According to Mr. Benjamin, starting in October 2021 the trustees of that fund permitted the council to withdraw roughly $13 million to fund its spending, but reversed their stance earlier this year and halted all payments out of the fund, including the regular living payments to Bikinians, to avoid further depletion. In the interview, Mr. Jibas said he also hoped to tap into new American funding to replenish the main fund.",
      "Earlier this year, the Biden administration promised to provide the Marshall Islands $700 million in one-time aid and to continue underwriting much of the government\u2019s budget. Under a treaty, the United States controls the country\u2019s defense policy, which the American government considers crucial to countering China in the region. The aid has not yet been approved, meaning Bikinians\u2019 future remains uncertain.",
      "In a statement on behalf of Mr. Jibas, Mr. Benjamin said that the mayor\u2019s critics were not pushing the United States hard enough for more funding.",
      "Mr. Jibok, who as a council member opposed Mr. Jibas\u2019s efforts to gain control of the fund, said that the United States had done little to facilitate self-sufficiency in the Bikini community, leaving few financial safeguards in place.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think we were ready,\u201d Mr. Jibok said, \u201cbecause I knew that we didn\u2019t have anything in place to control\u201d mismanagement or fraud."

      "BERLIN \u2014 Every day as he settles in at his desk, Erhard Grundl, a German lawmaker, looks outside his office window into the embassy he knows may be spying on him.",
      "\u201cI come into the office, and on a windy day, I see the Russian flag waving. It feels a bit like Psalm 23: \u2018You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,\u2019\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m not religious, but I always think of that.\u201d",
      "In the shadow of Berlin\u2019s glass-domed Reichstag, beyond the sandstone columns of Brandenburg Gate, German parliamentary buildings sit cheek by jowl with Russia\u2019s sprawling, Stalinist-style diplomatic mission. For years, a silent espionage struggle played out here along the city\u2019s iconic Unter den Linden avenue.",
      "Members of Parliament like Mr. Grundl were warned by intelligence offices to protect themselves \u2014 to turn computer screens away from the window, stop using wireless devices that were easier to tap, and close the window blinds for meetings.",
      "It seems an almost comical situation for officials in one of Europe\u2019s most powerful nations, where tensions over Russian espionage were something Germany\u2019s government long seemed willing to ignore. That has become increasingly difficult since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as a Cold War-era style chill settles across the continent and recasts relations with Russia.",
      "Late last month, Russia exposed what it described as a \u201cmass expulsion\u201d of its diplomats in Germany when it announced a tit-for-tat expulsion of more than 20 German diplomats from Moscow. It was a rare sign, security analysts say, of a subdued but growing counterintelligence effort that Berlin is now belatedly undertaking, after years of increasingly brazen Russian intelligence operations on German soil.",
      "At least twice, Russian groups suspected of Kremlin links have hacked German politicians and Parliament \u2014 the ",
      " just months before the 2021 elections that brought in Chancellor Olaf Scholz after Angela Merkel\u2019s 16 years at the helm.",
      "A few years earlier, a gunman accused of ",
      " shot dead a Georgian dissident in broad daylight at the leafy Kleiner Tiergarten park, less than a mile away from Berlin\u2019s government district.",
      "In 2021, police ",
      " a security guard at the nearby British Embassy who had been spying for Russia.",
      "And late last year, in perhaps the most disturbing case of all, a German intelligence officer was ",
      " passing surveillance of the war in Ukraine to Moscow.",
      "Germany\u2019s foreign ministry has been tight-lipped about the latest expulsions \u2014 even refusing to call them expulsions. But it acknowledged the\u00a0diplomats\u2019 departure was linked to \u201creducing the Russian intelligence presence in Germany.\u201d",
      "Expulsions were long a common German response to Russian operations \u2014 including the first parliamentary hack, in 2015, and the invasion of Ukraine, when 40 diplomats were sent back to Moscow. But security experts see the current move as part of a broader effort to bolster counterintelligence and chip away discreetly at what they long warned was an extremely high spy count at the embassy.",
      "Still, analysts like Stefan Meister, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said years of neglecting counterintelligence would take a long time to repair. When he worked with German spy agencies in 2000, he recalled, they did not have a single Russian speaker on staff. In contrast, he said, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, had long made Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, a top target for espionage.",
      "\u201cWe are not where we should be, or should have been,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russians are learning also. They have no limits, they have a lot of resources they put into this hybrid war, the information war. And we are always a few steps behind.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinally, they expel these guys,\u201d he added. \u201cBut why did it take so long?\u201d",
      "At the heart of the debate over Germany\u2019s handling of Russian espionage is the Russian Embassy: a palatial complex of soaring stone towers engraved with Soviet hammers and sickles. It has long been a site of fascination, consternation and intrigue.",
      "Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even for years after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the embassy was famous for lavish parties that attracted top German car industry executives, politicians, soccer stars and actors.",
      "But it had a darker side: Two of its inhabitants have mysteriously fallen to their deaths from embassy windows. In 2021, a ",
      " outside on the pavement by the German police, who believed he was an undercover agent of the FSB, the Russian secret service branch that Western officials linked to the Tiergarten murder.",
      "It is an open secret that most diplomatic missions host spies among their ranks, and for years, a former senior aide to Ms. Merkel told The New York Times, she and her staffers who visited the embassy would trade guesses as to how many worked at the embassy there \u2014 sometimes suggesting up to 600.",
      "In a recent ",
      " for ARD, the country\u2019s state broadcaster, the estimate of embassy staff before the war was said to be more than 500. German officials generally assumed that at least a third of those were spies, the former Merkel aide said.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency told ARD it found potential espionage equipment on the embassy roof \u2014 perhaps to spy on lawmakers across the street, like Mr. Grundl, or Frank Schwabe, from Mr. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe are not well enough prepared,\u201d said Mr. Schwabe, who works in the building across from the embassy, and focuses on human rights. \u201cI would actually like to see a targeted security strategy in Germany that really enables members of Parliament, to help them really arm themselves against these kinds of wiretapping attempts.\u201d",
      "For now, he offers visitors like Russian dissidents or civil society actors the option to move to another room \u2014 or to position themselves so their lips cannot be read.",
      "Security experts say such tips are not nearly enough to help politicians who appear to be a top target \u2014 not just near the embassy, but anywhere, using vans with smaller devices that can tap into phones and hear conversations.",
      "Mr. Meister said lawmakers with sensitive portfolios could be moved farther from the Russian Embassy. \u201cThen again, what isn\u2019t sensitive now? A domestic policy or other issues, like migration, could be used by the Russian side \u2014 there is almost nothing that isn\u2019t sensitive at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Nico Lange, a former German Defense Ministry official, who is now a senior fellow at the Munich Security Conference, said issues like migration were a key topic used by Russia in identifying and recruiting frustrated, far-right sympathizing members of German security and defense forces \u2014 like the mole arrested last year, or the security guard stealing information from the British Embassy.",
      "Complicating Germany\u2019s efforts to effectively combat Russian intelligence is the country\u2019s federalized system: Each German state has a different intelligence service.",
      "Mr. Lange acknowledged cooperation and data sharing among the services was improving, but said the setup inevitably has gaps. He also urged legislators to reverse laws granting espionage targets, even abroad, the same constitutional rights as German citizens.",
      "\u201cIntelligence agencies are a tit-for-tat business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not able to gather information, then your partners will not trade with you.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lange\u2019s current worry is that\u00a0Russian spies are\u00a0seeking information on weapons or training for Ukrainian soldiers. Already, suspected Russian operatives have been found near military training sites in Germany.",
      "Last month, Poland said it uncovered a ",
      " that had hidden cameras on rail lines in the southeast of the country, a major transit route for arms shipments to Ukraine. ",
      "But some lawmakers in Germany wonder whether concerns over Russia\u2019s spies have strayed too far from a problem within their own walls: Members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, whose leaders were frequent guests at the Russian Embassy, hold seats in some of the most important parliamentary committees, from foreign affairs to defense.",
      "Mr. Grundl fretted over the fact that just last week, those far-right colleagues sat on a parliamentary committee while a secret topic was discussed.",
      "\u201cThey are sitting in there, and they have the best connections to Moscow,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cThat\u2019s the bigger headache to me: the enemy within.\u201d",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The Brazilian police raided the home of former President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday and seized his cellphone as part of a sweeping investigation into forged Covid-19 vaccination records that may have allowed him and his top aides to gain entry into the United States.",
      "The authorities searched more than a dozen homes in Rio de Janeiro and Bras\u00edlia, arresting six people, including one of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s closest aides and two of his security guards, who are suspected of tampering with a government vaccination database and issuing falsified records.",
      "The forged vaccine cards may have allowed Mr. Bolsonaro and his aides to sidestep U.S. travel restrictions put in place at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, investigators said.",
      "False vaccine certificates may have been issued for Mr. Bolsonaro, his 12-year-old daughter, Laura, and other top officials in his administration, according to the Brazilian authorities. The police said the vaccination records were forged between November 2021 and December 2022.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Bolsonaro denied ever claiming he had been vaccinated and said the U.S. immigration authorities had never asked him to show a vaccination record.",
      "\u201cAt no time did I say that I took the vaccine, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro told reporters in front of his residence in Bras\u00edlia after handing over his mobile phone to the police. He said that deciding not to take the vaccine was a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d and he confirmed that his daughter had not been vaccinated either.",
      "Mr. Bolsonaro was named as a suspect in the investigation, according to documents released by Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday. The Supreme Court said in a decision approving the searches that the investigative connection between the president and a possible crime is \u201cplausible, logical and robust.\u201d",
      "During his time as Brazil\u2019s right-wing president, Mr. Bolsonaro, a staunch critic of Covid shots, consistently dodged questions about whether he was vaccinated against the virus. His vaccination status became such a controversy that, in 2021, Congress placed a century-long seal of secrecy on Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s vaccination records.",
      "Mr. Bolsonaro traveled to the United States at least four times during the pandemic, including in September 2021, when he took a delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. During the trip, he posted a photo of himself and his entourage eating pizza outdoors, setting off speculation over whether the group had been barred from dining indoors because of Covid restrictions.",
      "Mr. Bolsonaro was heavily criticized for stalling the purchase of Covid vaccines and for frequently spreading misinformation about them. At one point he claimed that the jabs could turn Brazilians into crocodiles.",
      "A Brazilian congressional investigation concluded that Mr. Bolsonaro should be charged with \u201c",
      "\u201d for his handling of the pandemic, which killed 700,000 people in Brazil. Prosecutors have not pursued those charges.",
      "The police were expected to question Mr. Bolsonaro about the falsified vaccination records later on Wednesday.",
      "Following the raid on his home, the normally brash Mr. Bolsonaro appeared solemn as he spoke on a right-wing television program. \u201cDuring my visits to the U.S., not at any moment was a vaccination card required,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there was no fraud on my part. \u201d At times he appeared to tear up during the interview.",
      "Among those arrested on Wednesday was Mauro Cid Barbosa, a military official who was Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s secretary and adviser.",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva seized on Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic during last year\u2019s election, which he narrowly won. Vowing to lift the veil of secrecy, Mr. Lula has begun reviewing hundreds of confidentiality seals put in place during Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s time in office.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let Brazilians know why you hide so much stuff,\u201d Mr. Lula told Mr. Bolsonaro during a debate last year.",
      "Separately, Mr. Bolsonaro faces a series of investigations, including one for spreading election misinformation and for inspiring the Jan. 8 ",

      "The shooting took place around 8:40 a.m. at Vladislav Ribnikar primary school, in Vracar, an upscale neighborhood, Chief Veselin Milic of the Belgrade police, said at a news conference. The student fatally shot seven girls and one boy using two handguns, which he took from his father. He also carried four self-made Molotov cocktails, Chief Milic said.",
      "Six children and a teacher were also injured in the attack. One of the children, a 13-year-old, was described as having \u201clife-threatening injuries,\u201d officials said.",
      "\u201cToday is one of the most difficult days in the modern history of our country,\u201d President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia said in a speech on Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, Serbia is united in grief.\u201d",
      "Saying the shooter \u201cshowed no remorse,\u201d Mr. Vucic confirmed that he had been arrested and taken to a mental health clinic. He would not be held criminally responsible for the killings because is under the age of 14, according to a statement from Belgrade\u2019s Higher Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, though Mr. Vucic said he would propose changes in the age of criminal liability.",
      "The boy\u2019s parents had also been arrested, the president said.",
      "A vigil took place Wednesday night in Belgrade\u2019s Flower Square, a block away from the school. Among those killed was a French girl, according to France\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which said in a statement that it was working to \u201cprovide all their support to the family.\u201d",
      "The authorities were alerted when they received a call from the school\u2019s vice principal who said a child had \u201centered the school with a firearm and was shooting randomly,\u201d the police chief said.",
      "Police officials said the student began shooting immediately upon entering the building, killing the security guard and others before making his way down a corridor toward a history classroom, which he had targeted because it was near the entrance.",
      "He shot into the classroom before fleeing to the school\u2019s yard, where he called the authorities to report himself, said Chief Milic in a televised interview with state media. He added that the suspect called himself a \u201cpsychopath\u201d who needed to be calmed down. He was apprehended shortly after.",
      "The security guard was killed while trying to stop the attack, according to the district\u2019s mayor, Milan Nedeljkovic.",
      "In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Vucic said that tragedies like the school shooting in Belgrade were happening \u201cevery week in other countries.\u201d He promised to introduce a series of measures designed to regulate guns and curb the likelihood of another attack.",
      "The proposals included lowering the age of criminal liability to 12, from 14, and a setting a moratorium on the possession and carrying of weapons. He also said he intended to enforce a review process for all gun owner permits.",
      "Serbia\u2019s health minister, Danica Grujicic, said at the news conference that three students and a teacher had been admitted to the Clinical Center of Serbia after 9 a.m., and were being treated for gunshot wounds.",
      "\u201cThis is my scariest experience as a doctor and a person,\u201d Ms. Grujicic said, describing how one of the students, around 13 years old, had \u201clife-threatening injuries\u201d to his chest, neck and spine. The teacher, who was born in 1970, had also suffered injuries to her pelvis and both hands.",
      "Three other students were being treated at a children\u2019s hospital, Tirshova, where one student, still in \u201cunstable condition,\u201d was receiving surgery for a severe head injury, the health minister said.",
      "Chief Milic said at the news conference that teachers characterized the suspect as a \u201cgood student and good friend\u201d who had not previously attracted attention. But President Vucic said later on Wednesday that the boy had asked his parents and teachers to transfer him to a different class, where he later felt alienated by his fellow classmates.",
      "One student who spoke to state television claimed to have spent time with the shooter, and described him as \u201ca quiet and polite person\u201d who had been bullied by others.",
      "The shooter\u2019s preparations for the attack, which the authorities said spanned over one month, were detailed in a map he sketched and a list of targets, including students. \u201cThe sketch looks a bit like something from a game or a horror movie,\u201d Chief Milic said. The student, who had demonstrated skilled use of the weapons, calmly recounted his crime to the authorities on Wednesday, Chief Milic said.",
      "The boy obtained the weapons from his father, who later told the police that he had permits for both pistols, which he kept locked in a safe for which his son had apparently discovered the code, Bratislac Gasic, the minister of police said at the news conference. The student had reportedly accompanied his father to a shooting range, he added.",
      "The shooting shattered the usual calm in the high-end enclave of Vracar, one mile from downtown Belgrade, where the school of about 1,100 students is nestled among rows of stately houses and leafy streets.",
      "Sirens and flashing lights from ambulances and police cars broke through the hushed spring morning, forcing from their homes residents who were desperate for news or assurances that their children were not among the victims.",
      "\u201cIt was terrible. I was downstairs. I heard the gunshots. They were continuous,\u201d said one student, who was visibly shaken, in an interview with state television. \u201cI had no idea what was happening,\u201d she said.",
      "Three official days of mourning will begin May 7.",

      "A lawyer defending former President Donald J. Trump against the writer E. Jean Carroll\u2019s lawsuit accusing him of rape said that he would present no witnesses during the trial, which completed its sixth day Wednesday.",
      "The lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, had earlier told Judge Lewis A. Kaplan that Mr. Trump would not come to Manhattan federal court to testify in the civil case.",
      "Mr. Trump, who is again running for president, went to Scotland and Ireland this week. When a reporter asked him why he was in Ireland instead of New York for his civil case, he responded that he had a longstanding agreement to travel there, according to a recording ",
      ". \u201cI hear we\u2019re doing very well in New York,\u201d Mr. Trump added.",
      "Even without witnesses, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers can still use testimony they have elicited during cross-examinations of Ms. Carroll and others who testified on her behalf when they make their closing argument, likely Monday. Judge Kaplan told jurors that they would likely receive the case to begin deliberations early next week.",
      "The attack happened during a visit to the luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman one evening in the mid-1990s, Ms. Carroll has said. As she was leaving through a revolving door, Mr. Trump entered and recognized her, she testified, and persuaded her to help him shop for a gift for a female friend. ",
      " in a dressing room in the lingerie department.",
      "On Wednesday, Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, played for the jury clips from an October 2022 deposition by Mr. Trump. At one point, he\u2019s asked whether he ever contacted Bergdorf\u2019s after the allegation.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have to reach out to anybody,\u201d Mr. Trump responds, adding that was because the assault never happened. \u201cIt\u2019s the most ridiculous, disgusting story,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just made up.\u201d",
      "Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers promised in their opening statement last week to show the jury not only that Mr. Trump had assaulted her, but also two other women \u201cin a remarkably similar way.\u201d",
      "One, Jessica Leeds, testified on Tuesday. The other, Natasha Stoynoff, a former People magazine reporter, took the witness stand on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Ms. Stoynoff choked up as she described how she had traveled to Mar-a-Lago toward the end of 2005 to prepare an article about Mr. Trump\u2019s one-year wedding anniversary with his wife, Melania. Ms. Stoynoff said Mr. Trump led her into a room, shut the door, pushed her against the wall and started kissing her. Ms. Stoynoff said she was \u201cflustered and sort of shocked.\u201d",
      "Ms. Stoynoff disclosed what had happened only to a few friends, she said. But more than a decade later, after the disclosure of the \u201c",
      "\u201d recording, in which Mr. Trump boasted in vulgar terms about grabbing women by the genitals, she said she felt \u201ca combination of sick to my stomach\u201d and \u201crelief.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause I actually for the first time thought to myself, oh, he does this to a lot of women. It\u2019s not just me.\u201d",
      "During Ms. Stoynoff\u2019s appearance, Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers played the recording for the jury.",
      "Ms. Stoynoff told the jury that she decided to write publicly about ",
      " after Mr. Trump said during a presidential debate that he had never kissed a woman without consent. She testified that she \u201cfelt really upset that he was lying to the American people.\u201d",
      "When Mr. Tacopina cross-examined Ms. Carroll earlier in the trial, he highlighted what he described as her unusual behavior during the alleged attack and her inability to remember some key details afterward. On Wednesday, Ms. Kaplan questioned Dr. Leslie Lebowitz, a clinical psychologist who spent about 20 hours interviewing Ms. Carroll, in an attempt to put Ms. Carroll\u2019s behavior in the context of common responses to traumatic events.",
      "Dr. Lebowitz testified that when a person\u2019s brain is inundated with stress hormones, the prefrontal cortex \u2014 part of the brain associated with logic and reasoning \u2014 shuts down and a person may \u201cdo things that appear to be illogical and irrational.\u201d",
      "Ms. Kaplan also questioned Dr. Lebowitz about why Ms. Carroll refused to use the words \u201crape\u201d or \u201cvictim,\u201d and how she has avoided men. She asked also about how the incident affected how Ms. Carroll saw herself in the world.",
      "\u201cShe blamed herself for it \u2014 she felt like she was stupid in a way that was hard to shake,\u201d Dr. Lebowitz said. But perhaps even more fundamentally than that, she said, \u201cit made her feel like she was worth less than she had been before.\u201d",
      "Chad Seigel, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, asked Dr. Lebowitz whether it would be fair to say that Ms. Carroll had presented her symptoms in a way that would benefit her case. \u201cI don\u2019t believe she did that,\u201d Dr. Lebowitz said.",
      "He asked whether Ms. Carroll had a \u201cvested interest\u201d in the case\u2019s result.",
      "\u201cShe certainly cares very much about the outcome of this case,\u201d Dr. Lebowitz replied."

On this afternoon last August, they were trying to help her find the holy grail: an apartment where someone with a severe mental illness could build a stable life.",

      "M, who has schizoaffective disorder, immediately began chattering. She said she was doing great, thanks to Mr. Payton: \u201cHe gave me a million-dollar bill in cash, so I\u2019m living off that.\u201d Her boyfriend sat beside her, rocking and weaving, one gloved hand in constant motion as if conducting an invisible orchestra.",

They live their lives both at the city\u2019s very margins and at the chaotic intersections of dysfunctional bureaucracies.",
      "There are other street programs that serve precarious New Yorkers; I.M.T. is for the toughest cases.",
      "Over the course of seven months, two teams that share a Brooklyn office let a reporter and photographer shadow them. The teams\u2019 workers meet clients where they are, at shelters and hospitals, train stations and park benches. They go along to court dates and housing interviews and inject them with antipsychotic drugs on street corners.",
      "They buy them chopped-cheese sandwiches and flip phones and warm socks \u2014 anything to keep clients engaged. Their job, said Ashwin Vasan, the city\u2019s health commissioner, is to be the glue that holds together the pieces of a fractured life.",
      "\u201cWhat this really comes down to is accompaniment,\u201d Dr. Vasan said. \u201cAm I able to walk beside you in your journey?\u201d I.M.T. teams, he said, \u201cfollow the ethos of \u2018whatever it takes.\u2019 There is no problem that isn\u2019t their problem.\u201d",
      "The city has found that the teams help people find stability, but the road there is steep and littered with obstacles. Hospitals discharge psychotic clients without notice. Shelters let benefit applications expire. Paperwork disappears.",

That\u2019s important \u2014 my relaxation and that will help you determine with what kind of housing you give me.\u201d",

      "No matter how far into fantasy M wandered, Ms. Daley \u2014 a type of counselor called a peer specialist \u2014 and her boss, Mr. Payton, 50, the team\u2019s program director, guided\u00a0her back toward the practical.",

      "Unlike similar programs, intensive mobile treatment is funded directly by the city, not Medicaid, which gives it flexibility. If a client says they want to \u201cbe a rich and famous rapper, we will write that \u2014 that\u2019s your goal,\u201d said Bridgette Callaghan, a vice president of the Institute for Community Living who oversees its six teams. \u201cWe\u2019re not into the business of reframing things so that it sounds clinically justifiable.\u201d",

      "As the van crawled through traffic, Ms. Schultz-Kappes got a text and yelled from the front seat, \u201cThey\u2019re discharging Brandon!\u201d",
      "Brandon Jackson came to the team in March 2022 after two years on Rikers Island for beating and robbing a woman. He got off to a rough start. He sent the staff photos of him cutting himself. He sold his risperidone, a flattening antipsychotic not known for its recreational appeal. Now he was hospitalized after attacking someone at his shelter.",
      "The night before, a hospital psychiatrist had emailed Ms. Schultz-Kappes that he \u201ccontinues to have little insight and is resistant to treatment.\u201d",
      "I.M.T. teams usually try to help clients avoid hospitalization, but sometimes they push hospitals to hold them longer. \u201cThe hospital is like \u2018Nope, they\u2019ve been here for five days. They\u2019re taking their meds. They\u2019re not a danger,\u2019\u201d Ms. Callaghan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re like, \u2018The second they leave, they\u2019re going to throw their meds in the garbage.\u2019\u201d",
      "The constant loop of progress and backsliding can be overwhelming, Ms. Schultz-Kappes said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just keeping in mind: These clients have been through so much and don\u2019t have anyone, and even just seeing little progress, like someone reaching out when they\u2019re in crisis or answering the phone \u2014\u2014 \u201d",
      "Grace Coviello, the team\u2019s psychiatric nurse practitioner, finished her sentence: \u201cIt\u2019s like counting little tiny baby wins.\u201d",

      "After Mr. Jackson\u2019s hospitalization, he stayed on his medications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a great time right now,\u201d he said on an office visit in late December. He hoped to get his high school equivalency diploma, then a job. In February, Mr. Jackson, 32, ",

      "M had two children very young, at 14 and 15. She worked briefly in a hair salon. She got into drugs. When she hit her 20s, her family saw something wasn\u2019t right.",

And she wouldn\u2019t remember what happened.\u201d At her first hospitalization, she received a diagnosis: schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.",
      "Her life ever since, her sister said, has been punctuated by medicated periods of relative lucidity, hospital stays, jail stints for prostitution and other minor crimes, and long stretches lost in a fog. Once she took off for Miami to live the high life. \u201cSometimes she feels like she\u2019s a celebrity,\u201d Marie said.",
      "In 2020, while living with Marie in Wisconsin, M asked for money to go shopping. The next her sister heard from her, M was in New York. She stayed for a while in shelters on Staten Island but was hospitalized briefly after she spat on another shelter resident. For the next two years, M seldom slept indoors, except in train and subway stations.",
      "In recent months, Mr. Payton had been urging her to try supportive housing and got her a phone interview with a prospective landlord. The interview did not go well. M learned that the apartment was temporary and that she would need to stay on medication and meet with a case manager.",
      "Before the interview, Mr. Payton said, M was lucid. Once it started, she began rhapsodizing about moonbeams in Florida.",
      "\u201cHer way of saying no and not wanting to deal with people is to go into psychosis,\u201d he said.",
      "It would have been easier to get M an apartment if she were medicated, and a team can ask a judge to mandate outpatient treatment, including medication, under Kendra\u2019s Law.",
      "But I.M.T. teams tend not to want to coerce their clients.",
      "\u201cWould I prefer that she be in a shelter?\u201d Ms. Callaghan said earlier this year. \u201cYes. But this is the life that she is actively choosing to live.\u201d",

      " to remove homeless people with severe mental illness from the streets, ",
      ". Before M was discharged, she was given an antipsychotic injection that lasts a month, Ms. Callaghan said. When Ms. Daley visited her at the foot of an escalator just inside the Court Square subway station in Queens right before Christmas, she was still largely coherent and considerably more subdued.",
      "Ms. Daley was there to do M\u2019s application for disability income. It was 30 pages long. For the employment section, M mentioned her job at the hair salon.",
      "\u201cWhat are some of the hairstyles you did?\u201d Ms. Daley asked.",

      "The death of a New York City subway rider who was placed in a chokehold by another passenger on Monday was ruled a homicide, the city\u2019s medical examiner confirmed on Wednesday evening.",
      "The man who died, Jordan Neely, was homeless and had been screaming at passengers when the other rider wrapped his arms around Mr. Neely\u2019s neck and head and held him for several minutes until he went limp. Mr. Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold, according to Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner.",
      "The killing, on an F train in Manhattan, has led to investigations by both the police and prosecutors, a spokesman for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg said. As of Wednesday afternoon, nobody had been arrested. ",
      "\u201cAs part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the Medical Examiner\u2019s report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible, and obtain additional medical records,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s spokesman said in a statement. ",
      "\u201cThis investigation is being handled by senior, experienced prosecutors and we will provide an update when there is additional public information to share,\u201d he added. ",
      "On Monday, a man who was riding in the same subway car went up to Mr. Neely, a 30-year-old ",
      " who was yelling that he was hungry and ready to die. The 24-year-old man who choked Mr. Neely has not been identified.",
      "The episode, filmed on a nearly four-minute video that shows other riders helping to pin down Mr. Neely while others looked on, has led to a police investigation and spurred advocates for the homeless, ",
      " and others to call for an arrest. Gov. Kathy Hochul said she needed to review the incident more closely but called the man\u2019s death troubling.",
      "\u201cIt was deeply disturbing,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "The incident comes as the city grapples with how to reduce both crime and the number of people with mental illness living on the streets, while also respecting the rights of its most vulnerable residents. The two issues have become the twin focuses of Mayor Eric Adams, who has sent more police to patrol train stations and to sweep homeless encampments even as he has supported policies that offer a ",
      ".",
      "Any criminal case could come down to whether the man who placed the rider in a chokehold was justified in using force, according to legal specialists.",
      "Under New York law, a person may use physical force on another person if they have a reasonable belief that it is necessary to defend themselves or others. But a person can only use deadly physical force if they have reason to believe that an attacker is doing or about to do the same.",
      "The police and prosecutors must determine what the intentions of the rider were when he grabbed Mr. Neely, if the rider felt physically threatened and if other passengers believed they had a reason to fear for their safety, said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cThe D.A.\u2019s office is going to do a painstaking investigation where they are going to interview every witness and look at the video frame by frame,\u201d she said.",
      "The police, who questioned the 24-year-old man and let him go on Monday night, said that they were investigating the death. A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney said that they were also investigating.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation confirmed Mr. Neely\u2019s identity, although the police have yet to do so.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams called the death \u201ctragic,\u201d and said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what happened here.\u201d He added, \u201cHowever, we do know that there were serious mental health issues in play here, which is why our administration has made record investments in providing care to those who need it and getting people off the streets and the subways, and out of dangerous situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was no empathy on that train car,\u201d said Karim Walker, an organizing and outreach specialist at the Urban Justice Center, who works with people who are homeless. There should be accountability for the death of Mr. Neely, he said.",
      "\u201cHe did not need to nor did he deserve to die in the manner that he did,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThat\u2019s what really scares me and that\u2019s what really breaks my heart.\u201d",
      "Witnesses said that Mr. Neely was acting in a \u201chostile and erratic manner\u201d toward other passengers on the train, according to the police.",
      "Juan Alberto Vazquez, a freelance journalist who was riding on the train and who shot the video, said the victim was yelling about being hungry and thirsty. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t mind going to jail and getting life in prison,\u2019\u201d Mr. Vazquez recalled him saying. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m ready to die.\u2019\u201d",
      "That kind of language might have led other passengers to believe that Mr. Neely was going to do something violent, said Todd Spodek, a criminal defense lawyer.",
      "\u201cI imagine that the collective feeling on that train was that something was happening,\u201d he said.",
      "The case raises questions about how people respond to the actions of the \u201cpoor, the unhoused and most especially those perceived as suffering from mental illness,\u201d said Christopher Fee, an English professor at Gettysburg College who teaches about homelessness.",
      "\u201cThose bystanders may have felt threatened by the victim, but they were not in fact attacked by him,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, they watched him die.\u201d",
      "Left-leaning politicians called the death of Mr. Neely, who was Black, ",
      "\u201d by the other rider, who appeared to be white.",
      "Mr. Vazquez said it did not appear as if Mr. Neely was suffocating, but after learning he died, he became troubled by what he had seen on the train.",
      "The reaction of bystanders reflects what can happen to many when they witness a crisis, said Lee Ann DeShong-Cook, assistant professor of social work at Juniata College.",
      "They \u201cwere experiencing various levels of fight, flight or freeze,\u201d she said, adding, \u201chad someone simply offered the homeless man a bottle of water or a snack he might have been able to calm down, re-engage his rational brain and would still be alive today.\u201d",
      "Workers from the Bowery Residents\u2019 Committee, which does homeless outreach in the subways, had known Mr. Neely since 2017, according to a person familiar with his history with social services.",
      "A team had spotted him on the subway as recently as March 22. He appeared to be struggling with both mental illness and substance use disorder, according to his records. At one point, he lived at a safe-haven shelter, which has more privacy and fewer restrictions than other shelters.",
      "Until recent years, the subway was where Mr. Neely had felt happy and free to perform as a dancer, said his friend, Moses Harper, an artist who met Mr. Neely in 2009, when he was 16 years old.",
      "Mr. Neely would dress up as Michael Jackson during his \u201cThriller\u201d stage and ride the trains, moon-walking in front of commuters.",
      "Mr. Neely and Ms. Harper, who also impersonates Michael Jackson, bonded over being street artists. Ms. Harper said she lost touch with Mr. Neely until she saw him again on a cold day in 2016, walking through subway cars with his head down.",
      "The two left the station and walked several blocks together, talking. She gave him her shirt, some food, and told him where she lived.",
      "Ms. Harper said she urged him to come find her when he was ready to get help.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get it together,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the last time I saw him.\u201d",
      "Emon Thompson, 30, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, said she first saw Mr. Neely about two weeks ago at around 1 a.m. after she boarded an F train in Lower Manhattan.",
      "\u201cHe was very upset at the time, and most of us just looked at him,\u201d Ms. Thompson recalled. \u201cHe said he needed help and kept repeating the words, \u2018food, shelter, I need a job.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ms. Thompson saw him again a week later, at about 8 p.m., when she and her 8-year-old son were on a Manhattan-bound F train. She said she gave him some money and he thanked her \u201cfor five minutes.\u201d",
      "Mr. Neely seemed tired, Ms. Thompson said, and told her he was embarrassed that he had not showered.",
      "\u201cI could tell he was at his wit\u2019s end, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look as if he wanted to beg and he looked mad that he even had to do that.\u201d",

      "Sarah Driscoll was out for drinks with colleagues one evening in early 2017 when a veteran political operative she worked with, Adam C. Sullivan, cornered her at a Washington bar.",
      "They were both directors of ",
      ", a small Democratic advocacy group leading a pitched fight against Donald J. Trump\u2019s new presidency. But rather than talk politics that night, Mr. Sullivan launched into an uninvited and graphic sexual rant, Ms. Driscoll recalled.",
      "He said \u201cI bet you slept with the whole Democratic Party,\u201d she said, and spoke of his own sexual prowess. He boasted about his penis size and described the ways he would like to sleep with her, as\u00a0Ms. Driscoll listened, speechless.",
      "\u201cI was kind of in shock,\u201d she recalled in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cI just was very numb and couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. And once it set in more, I felt really gross.\u201d",
      "Ms. Driscoll did not lodge a formal sexual harassment complaint until mid-July that year, when a woman she supervised came to her recounting a similar experience. A human resources specialist\u00a0investigated, found the claims credible and in the last days of July, the Hub Project quietly fired Mr. Sullivan.",
      "Less than a year after the incident, which has not been previously reported, Mr. Sullivan landed on his feet \u2014 running the re-election campaign of Kathy Hochul, then the lieutenant governor of New York. The two had worked together before: In 2011, he helped Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, win a special election for Congress, and she later recommended him for the job at the Hub Project.",
      "It is not clear what Mr. Sullivan told her about his time at the Hub Project. But the sequence of events places scrutiny on the judgment of Ms. Hochul, who, three years later, after she became governor following her predecessor\u2019s own sexual harassment scandal, ",
      " \u201cchange a culture of harassment and abuse, and ensure safe, respectful workplaces.\u201d",
      "The women from the Hub Project came forward after The New York Times published ",
      " that documented Mr. Sullivan\u2019s demeaning treatment of staff on Ms. Hochul\u2019s 2022 campaign and cast doubt on his stewardship of her political operation. Ms. Hochul ",
      " with him on Sunday, when she said that she was surprised and disappointed to learn of the behavior described by The Times.",
      "The new allegations from the Hub Project appear to be part of a pattern of troubling behavior as Mr. Sullivan, 43, bounced around the country as a campaign manager for prominent Democrats.",
      "Four people who worked with him \u2014 going back years before his tenure at the Hub Project, and as recently as her race for governor last year \u2014 described incidents to The Times in which he made unwanted sexualized remarks. They recalled situations similar to those Ms. Driscoll detailed, in which Mr. Sullivan made inappropriate comments, often while drinking, about female colleagues\u2019 bodies or romantic lives.",
      "The campaign aides spoke on the condition of anonymity because they continue to operate in Ms. Hochul\u2019s orbit and feared retaliation.",
      "At the Hub Project, Sarah English, the second woman who came forward after Ms. Driscoll, said in an interview that Mr. Sullivan had asked crude, invasive questions about her sex life.",
      "The Times interviewed a third woman at the Hub Project who said Mr. Sullivan also demanded she answer questions about sex as he vividly\u00a0described his own exploits. But\u00a0she said\u00a0she had not reported it at the time or been aware that others had received similar treatment until they began sharing experiences last week.",
      "New Venture Fund, the umbrella group that houses the Hub Project, confirmed the outlines of the women\u2019s account in a statement.",
      "\u201cNew Venture Fund\u2019s policy is to expediently, thoroughly and fairly investigate claims of impropriety among its staff,\u201d it wrote. \u201cIn strict adherence to the policy, New Venture Fund investigated the allegations immediately, and subsequently terminated the employee.\u201d",
      "In response to a list of detailed questions, Mr. Sullivan emailed a one-line statement: \u201cI apologize to anyone I made uncomfortable at any point,\u201d he wrote.",
      "After he left the Hub Project, Mr. Sullivan had other recent consulting clients, including the Reform Alliance, but Ms. Hochul appears to be the only politician who worked with him. He helped her build her new administration, managed a turbulent campaign for a full term in office, advised her on multibillion-dollar budget priorities and served as her conduit to the state Democratic Party.",
      "He has done all of it, though, with an unusually low public profile: He never took a job in state government, had no formal campaign title and was paid more than $500,000, mostly through a secretive arrangement that kept his name off campaign finance records.\u00a0He also worked from his home in Colorado.",
      "Asked to comment on Wednesday, Ms. Hochul reiterated that she had not known of the claims against Mr. Sullivan.",
      "\u201cSexual harassment is unacceptable under any circumstance, and these allegations are both shocking and deeply disappointing,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cNo one should have to tolerate this type of behavior, and I condemn it.\u201d",
      "Mr. Sullivan joined ",
      " in 2016 as one of the group\u2019s\u00a0first employees after\u00a0more than a decade running campaigns for Democrats like Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.",
      "Founded by the Democratic strategist\u00a0Arkadi Gerney, the group was originally set up to build support for liberal policies in anticipation of a Hillary Clinton presidency. When Mr. Trump won, the 18 or so employees there pivoted to become leading organizers of the resistance to his agenda.",
      "Ms. Driscoll, who had worked on President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, began working at the Hub Project\u00a0as its digital director not long after Mr. Sullivan started. ",
      "Ms. Driscoll and others said that\u00a0Mr. Sullivan created a toxic work environment, belittling and disrespecting women to the point that she actively sought to avoid him until one night in early 2017. Ms. Driscoll, 35, had joined her colleagues at a work-sponsored happy hour\u00a0at the Blaguard, a bar in Washington\u2019s Adams Morgan neighborhood, where Mr. Sullivan began haranguing her about her sex life and his own.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always gotten rave reviews,\u201d Ms. Driscoll recalled him saying that night. \u201cI know how to pleasure a woman",
      "Ms. Driscoll was able to pull herself away. She\u00a0recalled going home to tell\u00a0her boyfriend, now her husband, about the encounter through tears,\u00a0and she soon told a friend. But in the days before the\u00a0#MeToo movement, she worried\u00a0that Mr. Sullivan, who appeared to get along well with men in the office, would retaliate against her and that he would ultimately face no consequences for his actions. ",
      "She said she regretted not reporting the encounter sooner.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always had this fear that he was still out there, working in Democratic politics, making a ton of money and, most importantly, continuing to harass women,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said, explaining her decision to publicly describe her own experience. \u201cAnd it\u2019s always weighed on me.\u201d",
      "Ms. English, a graphic designer who worked under Ms. Driscoll, had her run-in with Mr. Sullivan a few months later. He had invited her and a few colleagues for celebratory drinks at Mission, another bar near the group\u2019s Dupont Circle\u00a0office, after a successful presentation to funders, she said.",
      "Ms. English found herself alone at the bar with Mr. Sullivan, who had been drinking steadily and\u00a0began asking her about her sex life. She said he repeatedly\u00a0called her a \u201chot girl\u201d and demanded to know how many times a week she had sex with her partner. She demurred, but he persisted, saying she should leave her partner if they were not having weekly intercourse.",
      "\u201cMy response was anger that someone in a position of power would speak with me like that, especially knowing that I\u2019m a younger, lower-level employee compared to him, especially working for a progressive nonprofit organization,\u201d Ms. English, 35, said in an interview.",
      "She said she did not report the incident to Ms. Driscoll\u00a0until several weeks later, when she began to\u00a0suspect\u00a0that Mr. Sullivan was retaliating against her in the office.",
      "Andrea Purse, who was the director for communications at the Hub Project, confirmed that Ms. Driscoll had told her at the time that she and a colleague had reported being sexually harassed by Mr. Sullivan.",
      "Ms. Purse recalled that soon after, Mr. Gerney told a small group of senior leaders that Mr. Sullivan had done something inappropriate that he could not discuss in detail and that he would not be returning to his position. Mr. Gerney, 48, declined to comment and referred questions to the New Venture Fund.",
      "A third woman whose work at the Hub Project was overseen by Mr. Sullivan recounted a similar experience during an office happy hour at Mission. She said she ended up alone at the bar with Mr. Sullivan, who began asking invasive questions about her sex life and speculating about the number of sexual partners she had while boasting about the frequency with which he had intercourse.",
      "The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was worried\u00a0about harming her career, said she found a way out of the conversation and tried to forget about the encounter.",
      "Ms. Driscoll and Ms. English said they were not asked to sign nondisclosure agreements at the time and were happy with how the complaints were handled. Management did not share the reason for Mr. Sullivan\u2019s departure broadly.",
      "In an Aug. 1, 2017, email to colleagues saying goodbye, Mr. Sullivan wrote simply that he had left the Hub Project \u201cas you have all heard.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have enjoyed working with all of you,\u201d he wrote in a copy of the email reviewed by The Times. \u201cAnd wish you all the best in the important work that lays ahead.\u201d"

      "\u201cGood morning,\u201d Ms. Carroll finally replied.",
      "\u201cThere you go,\u201d Mr. Tacopina responded.",
      "Thus began nearly two days of questioning during the trial in Manhattan federal court of Ms. Carroll\u2019s civil suit, which accuses Mr. Trump of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s.",
      "The cross-examination was a duel between two New York personalities: a woman who had been a star in the media world, writing an advice column on intimate matters for readers across America, and a lawyer known for aggressive advocacy who is now one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most visible champions and is also representing him in the criminal case brought by the Manhattan district attorney.",
      "Mr. Tacopina, with an expression of incredulity, tested Ms. Carroll on minute details of events of more than 30 years ago. He repeatedly asked her why she decided to come forward with the accusation when she did \u2014 an effort on his part to suggest to the jury ulterior motives: politics, money and fame.",
      "For generations, such questions have been mainstays for defense lawyers trying to undermine women\u2019s accounts of rape. But recent years have brought a wider consciousness of ",
      ", and Ms. Carroll at times used her testimony to explain that some behavior Mr. Tacopina questioned was in ",
      ".",
      "Ms. Carroll, who was on the witness stand for three days, described in painstaking detail for the jury of six men and three women how she had run into Mr. Trump as she was leaving the department store. She spoke of how he had asked her to help him choose a gift for a friend, how he had led her into a dressing room and how he had pushed her up against a wall, pulled down her tights, put his fingers into her vagina and then inserted his penis \u2014 all without her consent and while she tried to escape.",
      "Mr. Tacopina used his cross-examination not only to ask Ms. Carroll about what she said happened, but to question her about what she did afterward. He repeatedly asked her why she hadn\u2019t screamed and why she had called a friend instead of going to the police.",
      "The veteran lawyer, 57, who on the first day of cross-examination wore a tapered navy suit, was an imposing courtroom presence. He rarely let go of the lectern from which he lobbed questions in a deep, booming voice, at times leaning forward, to the side and backward.",
      "Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers frequently objected, arguing that many questions were argumentative, repetitive and at times misrepresented their client\u2019s testimony. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sustained several of the objections.",
      "The lawyer asked Ms. Carroll again and again whether she had screamed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a screamer,\u201d Ms. Carroll, 79, yelled. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat up on me for not screaming.\u201d",

      "\u201cWomen who come forward, one of the reasons they don\u2019t come forward is because they are always asked why didn\u2019t you scream,\u201d Ms. Carroll said. \u201cSome women scream. Some women don\u2019t. \u201d",
      "Mr. Tacopina also repeatedly asked why Ms. Carroll had not called the police, while she had once called them on behalf of a friend after children vandalized a mailbox.",
      "\u201cWomen like me were taught and trained to keep our chins up and to not complain,\u201d Ms. Carroll said. \u201cThe fact that I never went to the police is not surprising for someone my age.\u201d",
      "At some points, Ms. Carroll\u2019s lengthy answers did not address the question that Mr. Tacopina had asked.",
      "In response to a line of questioning about an excerpt from her 2019 memoir, in which she first publicly accused Mr. Trump of assault, Ms. Carroll instead told the jury a story about being hospitalized, and how she had been so ill that she had written a will.",

      "New York City, where sidewalks have long been overrun by foul-smelling heaps of garbage bags that force passers-by to yield to oncoming rat traffic, is about to try a not-so-novel idea to solve the problem.",
      "The concept, known as trash containerization, seems simple enough: Get trash off the streets and into containers. The strategy has been used successfully in cities across Europe and Asia, like Barcelona and Singapore.",
      "But in New York, nothing is that simple.",
      "In a ",
      " being released on Wednesday, city sanitation officials estimate that it would be possible to move trash to containers on 89 percent of the city\u2019s residential streets. To do so, however, will require removing 150,000 parking spots, and up to 25 percent of parking spots on some blocks.",
      "The report does not address the cost of implementing trash containerization citywide, but it could easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade. City officials must buy new specialized trash trucks and stationary containers, while also increasing the frequency of trash collection in large swaths of the city.",
      "The new approach could revolutionize trash collection in New York. Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat in his second year in office, has said attacking trash is one of his priorities, framing it as part of broader efforts to improve quality of life in the city after the disruption of the pandemic. He has ",
      " with a \u201ckiller instinct\u201d for slaying rats.",
      "But embracing trash containers will require trade-offs, including sacrificing more parking spots than were taken for outdoor dining or the city\u2019s popular bike-share program \u2014 both of which stirred pockets of outrage.",
      "The city\u2019s sanitation commissioner, Jessica Tisch, said in a statement that sanitation officials were working hard to remove trash more quickly, including ",
      ", and that trash containerization was the critical next step.",
      "\u201cMayor Adams wants a permanent solution, something like what other global cities have that takes our sidewalks back from the black bags \u2014 and from the rats,\u201d she said. \u201cThe detailed street-level analysis in this report shows, for the first time, that containerization \u2014 in the form of individual bins and shared containers \u2014 actually is viable across the vast majority of the five boroughs.\u201d",
      "The new trash program would look different across the city depending on the block. For a single-family home in eastern Queens, residents could be required to use individual bins for trash, recycling and compost. On a block lined with six-story apartment buildings in northern Manhattan, the street could get a dozen large aboveground containers \u2014 artist renderings suggest a cross between a dumpster and a giant laundry bin \u2014 placed in parking spaces.",
      "By this fall, the city will start a major new pilot program in West Harlem, in ",
      ", that will install large trash containers in parking spots on up to 10 residential blocks and at more than a dozen schools. On residential blocks, trash collection will double from three times a week to six.",
      "At a time when Mr. Adams is cutting spending across city agencies, he included more than $5.6 million for the pilot program in his latest executive budget proposal \u2014 a sign of his commitment to the idea, city officials said.",
      "Shaun Abreu, a City Council member who represents West Harlem, said in a statement that he was excited for the neighborhood to be a part of the pilot program and that it would \u201cmake a real difference and teach the city a lot about the path forward.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s 95-page new report examined trash containerization in cities across the world that have been experimenting with the idea for 15 years and analyzed the program\u2019s feasibility in each neighborhood. In the United States, San Francisco and Chicago remove garbage bags from the streets, mostly using individual bins and Chicago\u2019s famed alleyways which New York City does not have.",
      "New York City is a bit of a global pariah when it comes to trash. On garbage days in Manhattan, towers of fetid trash bags line the streets, with food and liquids oozing on to sidewalks. Sanitation workers carry out the Sisyphean task of carting away 24 million pounds of trash and recycling every day.",
      "Other cities have successfully reined in their garbage. Amsterdam uses ",
      " and ",
      ". Singapore and other cities use a ",
      ". Barcelona, Buenos Aires and Paris rely on shared and individual trash containers, providing the most useful examples of what is possible in New York, city officials said.",
      "The report was written by Sanitation Department staffers and informed by a study by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, that was initially reported to cost $4 million. The city ultimately paid McKinsey & Company $1.6 million for the study, city officials said.",
      "Ms. Tisch said in an interview that it was too early to provide an estimate for the total cost. But she acknowledged that the cost was \u201cnot inexpensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is one of the most massive, complicated infrastructure programs this city can undertake over the next decade because it affects every borough, every neighborhood, every block and frankly every resident in the City of New York,\u201d she said.",
      "Parking is one of the third rails of New York City politics, and the plan could face pushback in some communities. The city has roughly 3 million free street parking spots. Trash containerization would remove up to 10 percent of available parking spots on residential streets citywide, compared to ",
      ". Citi Bike, the city\u2019s bike-share program, has taken about half of a percent of curb space in its service area for bike docks, according to the company.",
      "On 11 percent of the city\u2019s most densely populated residential streets in places like Lower Manhattan, the city found that it was not feasible to install containers because there was not enough street space for the trash produced in those areas.",
      "Last year, Mr. Adams ",
      " that placed shared trash containers at 40 locations across the city, including on a block in Times Square. The pilot was not the right model for the city because it required manual collection of trash bags by sanitation workers, the report found.",
      "For a citywide model, sanitation officials want to use automated trucks known as \u201cautomatic side loading\u201d models that are not widely available in North America, but are used in Europe, the report said. City officials will develop a new truck based on the European model, but that could take several years. The Harlem pilot will use retrofitted sanitation trucks.",
      "Commercial trash from office buildings and restaurants is handled separately from homes, and much of it is ",
      " \u2014 an industry that has received a wave of criticism and is being overhauled. As part of containerization, city officials want to eventually require businesses to place their trash in sealed containers.",
      "When Mr. Adams announced the hiring of his rat czar last month, he lectured New Yorkers on picking up dog excrement \u2014 part of a ",
      " \u2014 and warned that more changes were coming. The mayor said he was immersed in the details of finding the right design for new trash trucks and containers.",
      "\u201cThere is a process to getting this city to become the cleanest city in America \u2014 which we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said."

      "That option is effectively a constitutional challenge to the debt limit. Under the theory, the government would be required by the 14th Amendment to continue issuing new debt to pay bondholders, Social Security recipients, government employees and others, even if Congress fails to lift the limit before the so-called ",

      " stating that \u201cthe validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.\u201d",
      "Some legal scholars contend that language overrides the statutory borrowing limit, which currently caps federal debt at $31.4 trillion and requires congressional approval to raise or lift.",
      "Top economic and legal officials at the White House, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department have made that theory a subject of intense and unresolved debate in recent months, according to several people familiar with the discussions.",
      "It is unclear whether President Biden would support such a move, which would have serious ramifications for the economy and almost undoubtedly elicit legal challenges from Republicans. Continuing to issue debt in that situation would avoid an immediate disruption in consumer demand by maintaining government payments, but borrowing costs are likely to soar, at least temporarily.",
      "Still, the debate is taking on new urgency as the United States inches closer to default. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned on Monday that the government could ",

      "But it remains unclear what type of compromise may be reached in time to avoid a default. House Republicans have refused to raise or suspend the debt ceiling unless Mr. Biden accepts spending cuts, fossil fuel supports and a repeal of Democratic climate policies, contained in a bill that narrowly cleared the chamber last week.",
      "Mr. Biden has said Congress must raise the limit without conditions, though he has also said he is open to separate discussions about the nation\u2019s fiscal path.",
      "A White House spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday.",

Lawyers at the White House and the Justice and Treasury Departments have never issued formal opinions on the question. And legal scholars disagree about the constitutionality of such a move.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution\u2019s text bars the federal government from defaulting on the debt \u2014 even a little, even for a short while,\u201d Garrett Epps, a constitutional scholar at the University of Oregon\u2019s law school, ",
      ". \u201cThere\u2019s a case to be made that if Congress decides to default on the debt, the president has the power and the obligation to pay it without congressional permission, even if that requires borrowing more money to do so.\u201d",

Krishnakumar, a Georgetown University law professor, wrote in a 2005 law review article.",
      "The president has repeatedly said it is the job of Congress to raise the limit to avoid an economically catastrophic default.",
      "Top officials, including Ms. Yellen and the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, have sidestepped questions about whether they believe the Constitution would compel the government to continue borrowing to pay its bills after the X-date.",

The government would default on its debt if Treasury stopped paying all bills. Economists have warned that could lead to financial crisis and recession.",
      "Progressive groups have encouraged Mr. Biden to take actions meant to circumvent Congress on the debt limit and continue uninterrupted spending, like minting a ",

      "\u201cI know you probably get tired of me saying this from here over and over again, but it is true,\u201d Ms. Jean-Pierre said on Thursday, after referring a question about the 14th Amendment to the Treasury Department. \u201cIt is their constitutional duty to get this done.\u201d",
      "But inside the administration, it remains an open question what Treasury would do if Congress does not raise the limit in time \u2014 because, many officials say, the law is unclear and so is the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to tax and spend.",
      "Officials who support invoking the 14th Amendment and continuing to issue new debt contend the government would be exposed to lawsuits either way. If it fails to continue paying its bills after the X-date, it could be sued by anyone who is not paid on time in the event of a default.",
      "Other officials have argued that the statutory borrowing limit is binding, and that an attempt to ignore it would draw an immediate legal challenge that would most likely rise quickly to the Supreme Court.",
      "There is a broad consensus on both sides of the debate that the move risks roiling financial markets. It is likely to cause a surge in short-term borrowing costs because investors would demand a premium to buy debt that could be invalidated by a court.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats who this week began a long-shot bid attempting to force a debt limit increase bill to the floor are pinning their hopes not just on a convoluted legislative gambit, but also on another highly improbable feat: getting a small group of Republicans to cross party lines and join them.",
      "While they concede it faces long odds, Democrats privately argue there is a path to pulling it off \u2014 or at least to coming close enough that Republicans feel compelled to cut a deal with them to head off a catastrophic default.",
      "It is based on the belief that some Republican lawmakers \u2014 especially among the 18 who represent districts that President Biden won in 2020 \u2014 could be persuaded to vote with Democrats to pass an 11th-hour debt limit increase that would pull the nation from the brink of financial ruin.",
      "\u201cThere are 18 House Republicans who like to call themselves \u2018moderates,\u2019\u201d said Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cHere\u2019s a chance for them to really put their money where their mouth is. Join with House Democrats to ensure we don\u2019t suffer the first-ever default in American history.\u201d",
      "Democrats on Tuesday ",
      " that would allow them to bypass Republican leaders and bring up legislation to increase the debt ceiling without the spending cuts and policy changes the G.O.P. has demanded in exchange. They could do so through a ",
      ", which forces a bill to the floor if a majority of the House signs on to calling for it.",
      "If every Democrat supported the move, at least five Republicans would be needed to advance such a measure to a vote.",
      "There is little evidence so far that House Republicans \u2014 even those in the most Biden-friendly districts \u2014 are inclined to undercut Speaker Kevin McCarthy, especially before he gets to the negotiating table with the president. The two are scheduled to meet in person on Tuesday at the White House for the first time since February.",
      "Republicans of all stripes have said they are in favor of spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, and bucking the party to vote with Democrats to increase the nation\u2019s borrowing limit would be seen as tantamount to a political betrayal.",
      "But that could change if talks between Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Biden stall and the nation barrels toward a default, now ",
      ".",
      "Here are some Republicans to watch.",
      "The predicted red wave for Republicans never quite materialized in 2022. But in New York, the party routed Democrats, partly as a result of a haywire redistricting cycle, and six Republican candidates won election in congressional districts that had voted for Mr. Biden.",
      "Democrats now consider five of those freshmen as some of the top prospects for cutting a deal. One of them, Representative Mike Lawler, who represents the suburbs north of New York City, had previously privately asked about the feasibility of a discharge petition.",
      "But he has also laid responsibility for negotiating a deal squarely at Mr. Biden\u2019s feet.",
      "\u201cThe White House needs to acknowledge the fact that there is no longer one-party rule,\u201d Mr. Lawler said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey need to negotiate in good faith, and they can\u2019t circumvent the speaker by just going to myself and my colleagues in these Biden districts.\u201d",
      "Democrats are also considering a group of lawmakers from California, including Representatives David Valadao, Young Kim, Michelle Steel, and John Duarte, who had one of the closest elections in the nation.",
      "Mr. Valadao has cultivated a reputation for years of sometimes defying his party, including when he voted to impeach President Donald J. Trump in 2021 for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol. Complicating any Democratic efforts to recruit Mr. Valadao: He is a close ally of Mr. McCarthy, who helped protect him from a serious primary challenge after he voted for impeachment.",
      "Some of the earliest indicators of whether there is appetite among Biden-district Republicans to strike a deal would come from two of the most outspoken centrist veterans in the conference: Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Don Bacon of Nebraska.",
      "Mr. Fitzpatrick, a former F.B.I. agent and U.S. attorney, has previously bucked his party, especially on gun control. He was one of two Republicans who voted last year ",
      " and one of eight who voted in 2021 ",
      " for firearms purchasers.",
      "Mr. Bacon, a former Air Force officer, helped lead the legislative charge to strip the names of Confederate leaders from military bases and held firm even after the Trump White House ",
      " and urged him to abandon the effort.",
      "Neither man has made any indication that he would break from his party to raise the debt ceiling. But Mr. Fitzpatrick ",
      " that he voted for the House G.O.P. bill \u2014 which conditioned a debt limit increase upon spending cuts and policy changes \u2014 only because he knew it would never become law.",
      "\u201cEvery single one of us knows that yesterday was nothing more than a mechanism to get Kevin and the president to sit down and deal with an existential threat,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was a 1 percent chance of any of these provisions ever becoming law, a lot of us would have treated that very differently.\u201d",
      "Some Biden-district lawmakers, including two freshmen, Representative Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, quickly became favorites of House Republican leaders and are unlikely to defect.",
      "Ms. Kiggans, a former Navy helicopter pilot, has in fact been on the front line of G.O.P. efforts to combat messaging from the Biden administration that House Republicans\u2019 bill would gut veterans\u2019 health care programs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m disgusted that the VA would blatantly lie about this bill & willingly use our nation\u2019s heroes as political pawns,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.",
      "That also goes for Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, who has hung on to his Biden-friendly seat despite repeated Democratic efforts to dislodge him. Mr. Schweikert, who has previously aligned himself with the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, has cut a far more conservative figure than his increasingly liberal district would suggest."

Blinken in November 2021, one senior State Department official said the generals had indicated that they were willing to again share power with civilians. The official, who insisted on anonymity to talk about the negotiations, said that withholding aid might not do enough to pressure the generals, and so the administration had appealed to their sense of an honorable personal legacy, among other things.",
      "Cameron Hudson, who served as the\u00a0chief of staff to successive U.S. presidential special envoys for Sudan, called that approach a mistake.",

These guys have been telling us what we want to hear since they agreed to civilian rule\u201d after Mr. al-Bashir\u2019s ouster, Mr. Hudson said. \u201cThere was supreme confidence in the State Department that we were on the cusp of a breakthrough agreement.\u201d",
      "Washington\u2019s willingness to bargain with the generals after the coup had the effect of legitimizing them, Mr. Hudson said.",

      "That left Mr. Hamdok all too vulnerable.",

If you are in an existential battle, maybe you are annoyed by sanctions, but it won\u2019t stop them going after each other.\u201d",
      "The first breakthrough after the coup came in December 2022, when the United Nations, the African Union and a regional bloc brokered a deal to transition Sudan to civilian rule in a matter of months.",
      "But enormous issues still had to be resolved, notably how quickly General Hamdan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces would be merged with the regular military, and who would report to a civilian head of state. The work of bridging those differences fell largely to the dominant foreign powers in Sudan: the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Even though Saudi Arabia and the Emirates are authoritarian monarchies, they profess to want democracy in Sudan.",
      "But as negotiations advanced, the gap between the two generals grew. Military reinforcements from both camps began to enter Khartoum.",
      "In late March, American and British diplomats presented the generals with proposals intended to bridge their biggest differences. Instead, the plan seemed to sharpen tensions. Weeks later, on April 12, General Hamdan\u2019s forces seized control of an air base 200 miles north of Khartoum, in the first public sign that the years of diplomacy were culminating in war.",
      "Three days later, the fighting began."

      "The announcement pointed to assistance that the suspect, Francisco Oropesa, may have had from relatives and others who lived near his home in eluding capture for four days while a manhunt stretched across Texas to the Mexican border.",
      "The hunt ended on Tuesday when heavily armed state and federal officers found Mr. Oropesa, 38, in a house a few miles from the site in San Jacinto County where the shooting took place on Friday. He was discovered \u201chiding in a closet underneath some laundry,\u201d according to the San Jacinto sheriff, Greg Capers.",

      "During her interview with the police, according to prosecutors, Ms. Nava said that Mr. Oropesa had showered and slept and that she had fetched him doughnuts from a nearby store. Prosecutors also said that she had passed a message from Mr. Oropesa to a cousin.",
      "\u201cThe message from him was him requesting assistance to get him to Mexico,\u201d a prosecutor said, reading from arrest paperwork; the cousin did not provide that assistance.",

      "Mr. Kean added that investigators did not believe that Mr. Oropesa had spent the whole four days of the manhunt at the house where he was ultimately found, and that he probably was the person who was spotted near a landfill on Monday. Though officers rushed to that location, Mr. Kean said, they did not capture Mr. Oropesa at that point.",

      "State and federal law enforcement officials had been searching for Mr. Oropesa in the thick woods around his home outside Cleveland, in neighboring counties and as far south as the border with Mexico, where, officials believed, he might have been trying to flee.",
      "But in the end, officers found Mr. Oropesa \u2014 whose face stared out from large Spanish-language posters around San Jacinto County, about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Houston \u2014 roughly 10 miles from the scene of the killings.",

Officials had offered rewards totaling $80,000 for information leading to Mr. Oropesa\u2019s arrest.",
      "Officials said that late Friday, Mr. Oropesa was firing a gun in his front yard outside Cleveland, on a plot of land smaller than an acre in a row of similarly sized properties along a rutted dirt road. His immediate neighbors, a family from Honduras, complained about the noise around 11:30 p.m., both to Mr. Oropesa and by calling 911.",
      "Officers did not immediately go to the area, ",
      ". Soon after the complaints, officials said, Mr. Oropesa could be seen on a doorbell video entering his neighbor Wilson Garcia\u2019s home, armed with an AR-15-style rifle.",

      "Officials declined to answer questions on Tuesday about the speed of the response to the killings.",
      "The top official in San Jacinto County, Fritz Faulkner, said in a telephone interview that he was alerted to the arrest shortly after it happened. The killings shocked the community, he said, and the arrests meant the county was now, after several days, finally able to rest easy.",

      "The Florida bills were part of a broader effort to revisit the First Amendment protections for the media. In recent years, a collection of judges, politicians and lawyers \u2014 most of them conservatives \u2014 have fiercely criticized The New York Times Company v.

      "Ben Vinson III, who has served as provost of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland since 2018, was chosen to be the 18th president of Howard, a 156-year-old university in Washington, D.C., that counts Vice President Kamala Harris, the former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and the author Toni Morrison among its alumni. He will assume the post on Sept. 1.",
      "The move, ",
      " on Tuesday, comes at an energized time for Howard, which has scored a series of wins in recent years, including record research expenditures and high-profile academic hires. Dr. Vinson will need to keep up the momentum, as well as deal with students who have staged sit-ins and protested conditions at the university.",
      "\u201cDr. Vinson is the right leader to usher Howard into its next era,\u201d Leslie Hale, vice chair of the university\u2019s board of trustees, said in a statement. \u201cAs a historian, he reveres the Howard legacy and brings a bold perspective of where Howard University should sit within the upper echelon of academic institutions.\u201d",
      "Some faculty members said his selection was a surprise, objecting to the search process. Dr. Marcus Alfred, an associate professor of physics and astronomy and chair of the faculty senate, said the university limited the faculty senate\u2019s participation. And he said that in a break from the past, the university community was not given the opportunity to meet with the finalists.",

Frederick, who said last year that he would step down as president of the university, called the facilities investment a \u201cwatershed moment.\u201d Officials described it at the time as the biggest real-estate investment in the university\u2019s history, driven partly by increased enrollment.",
      "They also credited increased public and philanthropic investment. In 2020, the university announced that it had received a $40 million gift from MacKenzie Scott, the former wife of Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon.",

      "California has been losing residents to other states for decades, though that was usually offset by arriving immigrants, whose numbers plummeted in 2020. The growth in remote\u00a0work\u00a0has also allowed more people to seek cheaper housing in other states, enticing high-income and highly educated Californians to join the net exodus, ",

      "So, as the future of workplaces remains uncertain, so do the future demographics of California.

      "But experts also pointed to a continuing de-emphasis on social studies instruction.",
      "Since the implementation of No Child Left Behind in the early 2000s and its update during the Obama administration, federal policy has required states to test students in reading and math. Periodic testing is also required for science.",
      "No such mandate exists for social studies. (Many state policies around testing and accountability ",
