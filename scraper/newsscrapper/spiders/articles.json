      "CHESTER, England \u2014 When Waheed Arian was 5, his father knelt by his side and handed him a big, colorful kite. That small moment, in Afghanistan, seared itself into the son\u2019s memory.",
      "\u201cI was a child born into war, \u201c said Dr. Arian, now 39 and a medical doctor. \u201cI had no idea what normality was like. And I only have a couple of happy memories like this from the first years of my life.\u201d",
      "Those years, in the late 1980s and 1990s, were spent in the chaos of war, with uncertainty swirling around him, first in his home city of Kabul; then in a refugee camp in Pakistan where he was displaced with his family; and then back to an Afghanistan engulfed in civil war.",
      "Decades later, driven by hopes of one day becoming a doctor, he established a new life in Britain, where he overcame post-traumatic stress disorder, learned English and studied medicine at Cambridge University, eventually becoming an emergency room doctor.",
      "\u201cI came in with no family support and hardly an education,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cBut I wanted to do something with my life and I was taking steps toward it, although it was a long shot.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, ",
      " from Kabul to Britain as an asylum seeker. His story, a personal tale of overcoming odds, illustrates how Britain\u2019s asylum system has long provided sanctuary and opportunity for countless people.",
      "But in recent years, successive Conservative governments have cracked down on the process, particularly with policies intended to deter asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel.",
      "This month, the government ",
      " crossing the Channel without hearing their asylum claims, a position that has been criticized by human rights groups. The British government says that many who arrive this way are economic migrants and that the policy will act as a deterrent. Government data, though, shows that a majority who reach shore are eventually granted asylum.",
      "Dr. Arian said his own journey showed \u201cwhat can be done when you allow people to realize their potential.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this case, you can see the future I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are so many other futures on the line.\u201d",
      "Speaking from his home in Chester in northwestern England, Dr. Arian, a father of two, recounted the arduous journey that led him out of Afghanistan.",
      "When his parents sent him to Britain in 1999, alone at 15, it was a tough decision for them, he said. But, he explained, \u201cI was at risk of being taken as a military soldier.\u201d He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a future. I wanted to become a doctor, not a killer.\u201d",
      "So his parents scraped together the money to pay a man to help him get to Britain to join a family friend.",
      "He boarded a plane from Islamabad, Pakistan, a false passport in hand, and claimed asylum when he arrived.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I landed in the U.K., I was handcuffed and I was put in a prison,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did come with that hope of safety, and the dream to become a doctor.\u201d",
      "That dream began in childhood when he was treated for tuberculosis contracted in the refugee camp in Pakistan. Despite a grim prognosis, a local doctor gave him excellent care \u2014 and a textbook and a stethoscope. He made a full recovery and he now knew what he wanted to be when he grew up.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, I saw so much suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd on the other hand, there was this healer who could actually magically heal people.\u201d",
      "He eventually received refugee status in Britain. He worked three jobs and began studying for his college exams. He remembers other Afghan refugees telling him to become a driver or maybe a shopkeeper.",
      "Instead, he applied to Cambridge University. And against the odds, he got in, and then went on to medical school. He became a British citizen.",
      "A soft-spoken man who seems to put care and attention into every word, Dr. Arian spoke of the importance of giving back through humanitarian efforts.",
      "\u201cWe might think it\u2019s a small thing,\u201d he said, describing the many supporters who offered him a kind word, a job or other opportunities over the years. \u201cBut it\u2019s not for many refugees. Their futures rely on all these small parts, these bits of community service, that can then shape their future.\u201d",
      "In 2015, he founded, ",
      ", a nonprofit online platform\u00a0that connects British doctors with medics in Afghanistan through video links. The service was later extended to connect doctors in Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones, to professionals around the world. It ",
      "Dr. Arian is now building off that success with\u00a0",
      ", a platform meant to offer culturally sensitive mental health support, which he believes can be beneficial for refugees who have experienced trauma. It will be free for those who can\u2019t afford to pay.",
      "He hopes to roll out Arian Wellbeing in the coming months to provide aid for those newly arrived in Britain as part of a pilot with some local officials. Within five years, he hopes thousands of psychologists will offer their services on the platform, so that it can help when the next disaster, like the recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria, or the war in Ukraine, arrives.",
      "For years after reaching the safety of Britain, the ghosts of his past haunted him.",
      "\u201cI was working so hard, three jobs at first \u2014 cleaning, kitchen porter, as well as a salesman, and in the evening I was studying a bit of English as well,\u201d Dr. Arian said. \u201cIt was at that time that my PTSD started showing.\u201d",
      "He found himself unable to relax, clenching his hands and having flashbacks. In the middle of the night, he would wake up with intense nightmares.",
      "Working with a psychologist has helped him address these problems, he said.",
      "He, his wife and their children live in a two-bedroom home with a big backyard. They have a Burmese cat and a small dog named Pushkin. The yard is scattered with children\u2019s toys, and the walls of the home are lined with family photos. Some siblings and his father are still in Afghanistan; his mother recently died there.",
      "Last month, Dr. Arian visited a local hotel where hundreds of recently arrived asylum seekers from Afghanistan were being housed after being displaced when the country was retaken by the Taliban in 2021.",
      "\u201cI see the same problems that I experienced in their eyes,\u201d he said, describing how the children\u2019s faces lit up when he spoke to them in their shared mother tongue.",
      "In this meeting, and in the others he has had with asylum seekers from across the world who arrive in Britain, he said he has seen just how detrimental the government\u2019s policies have been on their mental health.",
      "\u201cI can only imagine what at-risk refugees are going through in hotels,\u201d he said, where many are being housed as they await a decision on their future. \u201cWe have made friends with some of them, and they are being retraumatized to be going through all this.\u201d",
      "Most of all, he saw a reflection of his own story. He hopes he can be an example for those who struggle with the complexity of life in a new and unfamiliar place.",
      "\u201cWhenever I speak to these refugees, they have their individual dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I understand that.\u201d"

      "SANTA MAR\u00cdA DE JES\u00daS, Guatemala \u2014 For her big underwater scene in \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever,\u201d the Guatemalan actress Mar\u00eda Mercedes Coroy had to hold her breath as her character, Princess Fen, gives birth in a hazy ocean world to a winged serpent son.",
      "She emerges from the watery depths as a rarity even in Marvel\u2019s fantastical universe: a female Maya superhero.",
      "The day after filming her final scene in Los Angeles, Ms. Coroy, rather than hanging out in Hollywood, headed home to Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, a Kaqchikel Maya town of about 22,000 at the base of a volcano in Guatemala. By nightfall, she was curled up in bed in her family\u2019s bright pink cinder block house with vegetables growing in the backyard.",
      "\u201cI felt like my bed was hugging me,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, 28, one of nine siblings in a family of farmers and vendors.",
      "The next morning she resumed her usual life. She and her mother put on their hand-woven huipiles, or blouses, and cortes, or skirts, to catch the 5:30 bus to the small city of Escuintla to sell produce in the bustling market, a job she started after fifth grade when she had to drop out of school to help her parents.",
      "Some days she walks two hours with a mule to the family farm to cultivate cabbage and pumpkins. In her spare time, she weaves colorful huipiles with motifs of birds and flowers on a backstrap loom.",
      "\u201cPeople ask me what I do after filming,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who is working on her third Guatemalan movie after appearing in two in the United States. \u201cI go back to normal.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy represents a new generation of Maya actors determined to hone their craft while holding onto their customs and helping expose a legacy of discrimination against Guatemala\u2019s Indigenous population.",
      "While she said she enjoys acting in the United States \u2014 and posing in a pink and blue huipil at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards \u2014 she is more interested in her own country\u2019s burgeoning film industry.",
      "But whether she\u2019s working in her homeland or Hollywood, acting can be draining, and she relies on Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas to recharge her.",
      "\u201cI love my life, but filming is physically demanding,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, relaxing on a bench in Santa Mar\u00eda\u2019s central park. \u201cThis is my community.\u201d",
      "Ms. Coroy\u2019s first role was the lead in a school play production of \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u201d",
      "Santa Mar\u00eda de Jesus has long been locally famous for its street theater, and a decade ago, the Guatemalan director Jayro Bustamante came to the town to prepare for his first feature film, \u201cIxcanul\u201d (\u201cVolcano\u201d). He wanted to tell a story of Maya women that addressed issues like endemic poverty and inequities in education and health care, and he was determined to cast Maya actors speaking the Indigenous language of Kaqchikel.",
      "Mr. Bustamante initially put up a sign in the town\u2019s central park: Casting Here. No one showed up. A few days later he posted: Work Here. He was overwhelmed with prospective actors.",
      "Ms. Coroy missed the audition. But a friend put her in touch with the director the next day.",
      "\u201cHe told me I was the only person who looked him in the eye,\u201d she said. When he offered her the lead, she balked. \u201cI had no experience. I was afraid I would ruin the movie.\u201d",
      "But he convinced her to join the cast. For the next several months, they trained at the country\u2019s first film academy, founded by Mr. Bustamante.",
      "\u201cWhen we began filming, they were no longer amateur actors,\u201d Mr. Bustamante said.",
      "\u201cIxcanul,\u201d which ",
      " at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, focuses on a poor family in the mountains that arranges for the daughter to marry a plantation overseer. The daughter secretly gets involved with a young man, a drunk and a dreamer, who promises to take her with him to the United States. But he leaves without her and she finds herself pregnant while still engaged to the other man.",
      "After she gives birth in a hospital, a staff member tells her that her baby has died. When the young woman finds out later that her child had lived and had possibly been sold for adoption, grief consumes her.",
      "\u201cQuiet and fearless,\u201d the Los Angeles-based film critic Manuel Betancourt wrote of Ms. Coroy\u2019s understated performance, which revealed anguish behind a still face.",
      "\u201cI mouthed the words I was feeling in my head,\u201d Ms. Coroy said, explaining her acting method. \u201cIt was easier then because I was naturally timid. I\u2019m much more animated now.\u201d",
      "Her second film with Mr. Bustamante, \u201cLa Llorona,\u201d transformed a traditional Latin American ghost story into an indictment of a fictional dictator, but one clearly reminiscent of the Guatemalan leader, Gen. Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt. Five years before ",
      ", General R\u00edos Montt was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity for the systematic slaughter of Maya men, women and children in the 1980s after he took control of the country in a coup.",
      "Ms. Coroy plays Alma, a Maya housemaid whose son and daughter were among those murdered. A spectral figure in white, she haunts the dictator in his home.",
      "A casting director saw her in the two Bustamante films and picked her for the part of an Indigenous guerrilla in \u201c",
      ",\u201d an American film starring Julianne Moore. For two-and-a-half months, Ms. Coroy filmed in Mexico and the United States, the longest she had ever been away from her family. She froze in New York, she said, and didn\u2019t like the food.",
      "The actress prefers not to discuss politics. But Mr. Bustamante said artists in Guatemala worked in an increasingly hostile climate.",
      "\u201cYou realize you\u2019re in a country where there is a dictatorship without that name,\u201d Mr. Bustamante wrote in an email interview. \u201cThere is a murky sort of oppression and no rights or freedom.\u201d",
      "When \u201cIxcanul\u201d was released, he wrote, \u201cthere was a general rejection by the Guatemalan people of this sort of subject matter. With La Llorona, it was much more dangerous. We received anonymous threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cWakanda Forever,\u201d a global blockbuster distributed by Disney, also addresses the oppression of the Maya.",
      "Ms. Coroy\u2019s character, Princess Fen, catches smallpox brought by the Spaniards to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in the 16th century. A shaman gives her a drink that allows her to live and give birth underwater. When her winged son Namor, played by the Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta, returns to the Yucat\u00e1n, he sees Spaniards beating the Maya they have enslaved.",
      "In Guatemala, some Maya families encourage their children to speak only Spanish and wear Western clothing to escape ongoing rampant discrimination. But that\u2019s not how Ms. Coroy was raised.",
      "\u201cMy parents tell me I should be proud,\u201d said Ms. Coroy, who eventually returned to night school and finished college. \u201cThere is no way that you can hide that you\u2019re Indigenous.\u201d",
      "She has recently begun delving into Maya spirituality. Her grandmother was a natural healer who taught her about the curative properties or herbal teas and flowers. While she worships in a Catholic church, she also studies with an Indigenous spiritual teacher and reads the Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh.",
      "Central to Maya religion is Maxim\u00f3n, a trickster deity both benevolent and hedonistic. In ceremonies, adherents smoke and drink in front of his wooden figure in the hopes he will hear their entreaties. Ms. Coroy attends ceremonies without imbibing, she said.",
      "\u201cI respect Maxim\u00f3n,\u201d she said. \u201cI have connected with him in dreams. He said, \u2018You neither speak well of me nor poorly, so I will protect you.\u2019\u201d",
      "While she\u2019s famous enough in Guatemala that people in the colonial tourist city of Antigua, a UNESCO World heritage site, approach her politely for autographs, her neighbors in Santa Mar\u00eda avoid singling her out. Walking in the town\u2019s park, she might as well be any other vendor.",

We also like the diversity \u2014 people from all walks of life and different backgrounds. We like the small-town kind of feel.\u201d",

      "That was the experience of Virginia Hill, 33, a project manager at a plumbing fixtures company, and her husband, Daniel Montano, 35, a real estate agent with Signature Realty in Westfield. The couple, who have three children (and a fourth on the way), looked for homes in Westfield, Mountainside, Madison and other communities, but \u201cfinding a four-bedroom house in the $500,000 range was just unheard-of in those towns,\u201d Mr. Montano said.",

      "\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d play to this kind of crowd,\u201d he said, backstage after the show earlier this year at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel, a town in northern Israel originally founded as a collective farm. A decade ago, he said, \u201cThis kind of crowd just didn\u2019t really exist.\u201d",
      "In addition to Mr. Ribo, other singers from a religious background \u2014 like Nathan Goshen, Hanan Ben-Ari, Akiva Turgeman and ",
      " \u2014 have also in recent years gained a wider audience. And their popularity reflects a changing Israeli society.",
      "The religious right has expanded its influence on politics and society, escalating a clash between secular and sacred visions of the country that ",
      ". At the same time, religion has taken on a more prominent, and less contentious, role in the mainstream music scene.",
      "In less than two decades, religious singers have moved from the cultural fringe to widespread acclaim, \u201cnot only among their people, but in all Israel,\u201d said Yoav Kutner, a leading Israeli music critic and radio presenter.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to the words,\u201d Mr. Kutner added, \u201cthey sound like Israeli pop.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo is perhaps the clearest example of this shift. Forgoing the erotic and the profane, his wholesome songs are often prayers to God \u2014 but sung to pop and rock music played by his band of guitarists. ",
      "Cause of causes",
      "he addresses God in one of his biggest hits. \u201cOnly you should be thanked for all the days and nights.\u201d",
      "In 2021, that track, \u201cSibat Hasibot,\u201d was the most played song on Israeli radio stations, religious and secular alike.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of my duty,\u201d Mr. Ribo said in a recent interview. \u201cTo be a bridge between these two worlds.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s journey toward that bridging role began in the early 2000s, on the bus to his religious school.",
      "His family had immigrated from France a few years before. They led an ultra-Orthodox and ascetic life on a settlement in the occupied West Bank, just outside Jerusalem.",
      "The family did not have a television, and Mr. Ribo attended an ultraconservative Jewish seminary. He listened to music on religious radio stations \u2014 often liturgical poems sung in synagogues. He typically heard secular music only on the bus to school, playing from the driver\u2019s radio.",
      "\u201cI had this musical ignorance,\u201d Mr. Ribo said.",
      "At age 11 or so, he began recording simple songs on a portable cassette player. Then as now, his lyrics were infused with piety, Mr. Ribo said. But the tunes were inspired by the mainstream singer-songwriters he\u2019d heard on the school bus.",
      "Some four years later, Mr. Ribo bought a guitar and formed a band with another seminary student. He began to practice and dress as a Modern Orthodox Jew, forgoing the dark coats and wide-brimmed hats of the ultra-Orthodox for jeans and sweaters.",
      "But his awareness of contemporary music and its customs was still patchy. At his band\u2019s first gig, Mr. Ribo played with his back to the audience, unaware of the need to engage with the crowd.",
      "Unlike many Israelis from ultra-Orthodox Jewish backgrounds, he paused his religious studies at age 22 to serve for two years as a conscript in the army. After finishing service in 2013, he tried to build a hybrid musical career \u2014 playing religious music to both secular and devout audiences.",
      "He imagined his melodies might sound like Coldplay, the popular British rock band, but his lyrics, he added, \u201cwould be about God and faith.\u201d",
      "The challenge was that there were few templates then for such a crossover career.",
      "Only a few religious artists, like the folk singer ",
      ", had built a secular following. The most successful religious artists were often those, like Etti Ankri and ",
      ", who had started out secular, became more devout, and then took their original audiences along with them.",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s problem, initially, was that the music industry \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what I had to offer,\u201d he said.",
      "When he sent his music to mainstream record labels, they all turned him down.",
      "Mr. Ribo forged ahead, self-releasing the first of five albums in 2014. He hired a secular manager, Or Davidson, who marketed him as if he was a secular client \u2014 booking him to play at mainstream venues and securing him airtime on nonreligious radio stations. Gradually, his secular fan base expanded.",
      "It was sometimes a fraught balancing act.",
      "Religious Jews criticized him for playing at secular concert halls. Secular Jews opposed his performances at religious venues where men and women sat separately. And when he played to both audiences at secular venues, the staff could not provide kosher food for his religious fans. Even his parents were too religiously observant to attend some of the venues.",
      "But the two-pronged approach ultimately worked. Four of his five albums were classified as gold or above \u2014 selling more than 15,000 copies in the small Israeli market. Secular pop legends, including Shlomo Artzi, began to perform duets with him, and he began to build an audience among diaspora Jews. Later this year, he is scheduled to headline Madison Square Garden, Mr. Davidson said.",
      "To an extent, Mr. Ribo\u2019s appeal is rooted simply in the catchiness of his songs, his clean-cut demeanor and sincere performances.",
      "\u201cEven though I\u2019m secular, I came to watch him because he\u2019s lovely,\u201d said Adiva Liberman, 71, a retired teacher attending his concert at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel.",
      "\u201cNot everyone is paying attention to the lyrics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re just attracted to the melody.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise comes amid not only a political shift rightward in Israel, but demographic changes as well. Religious Israelis, who have ",
      " than secular Israelis, are the fastest-growing part of the population, allowing them to exert greater cultural influence.",
      "Daniel Zamir, an Israeli jazz star who turned religious as an adult, said Mr. Ribo\u2019s broad appeal is part of \u201ca bigger process of Israeli society moving toward tradition.\u201d",
      "Simultaneously, Mr. Ribo\u2019s rise embodies a converse but complementary trend: greater willingness among some religious musicians to cater to and mix with mainstream audiences, and greater demand among religious audiences for music with a more contemporary sound.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca dual process,\u201d Mr. Zamir said. Mr. Ribo is emblematic of \u201cthis new generation that saw that you could be religious and also make great music,\u201d Mr. Zamir added.",
      "For some secular consumers, the rise of \u201cpop emuni\u201d \u2014 \u201cfaith pop\u201d in Hebrew \u2014 has been jarring. \u201cI am not interested in hearing prayers on my radio,\u201d ",
      " Gal Uchovsky, a television presenter, in a 2019 article about the proliferation of Mr. Ribo\u2019s music. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to explain to me, even in songs that brighten my journey, how fun God is.\u201d",
      "Mr. Ribo\u2019s latest song, \u201cI Belong to the People,\u201d also caused discomfort among liberal Israelis. Released in early April, it is an attempt to unite Jews at a time of ",
      " in Israel. But critics said it unwittingly sounded condescending to people from other faiths, implying they were idolatrous.",
      "Mr. Ribo has also caused discomfort within the religious world. Some ultra-Orthodox Jews, particularly their religious leaders, feel he has delved too far into secular society.",
      "Early in his career, Mr. Ribo personally felt so conflicted about this that he sought his rabbi\u2019s approval for his work. To avoid alienating his religious base, there are still some lines he refuses to cross.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to write a classic love song \u2014 but I won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Ribo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job or duty.\u201d",
      "Still, some feel he has already compromised too much. In a popular ",
      " performed by an ultra-Orthodox comedy duo, an ultra-Orthodox man is asked if he knows any secular singers.",
      "The man pauses, then replies: \u201cIshay Ribo!\u201d",

      "In late winter of last year, Maria Kitsopoulos, a member of the New York Philharmonic since 1996, arrived for rehearsal with a cello on her back and Rubbermaid container in hand. Inside, she had tucked little squares of homemade cheesecake, the luscious filling held together by two layers of flaky pastry. \u201cMusicians love free food,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey see that box and come running.\u201d",
      "She made sure that the first pieces went to the stage manager and stagehands. (\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who find cushions for you,\u201d she said.) Then, just before going onstage, she handed the last squares to an assistant of the guest conductor, Gustavo Dudamel, the Venezuelan superstar with a halo of dark curls who, in 2009, took over the Los Angeles Philharmonic and has led it to glory ever since.",
      "She didn\u2019t know if her small offering would be left to languish in a dressing room. But at the end of the concert later that evening, after the thrilling race to the end of Schumann\u2019s Fourth Symphony and with the audience aroar, Dudamel turned to the cello section, gave her a thumbs-up and mouthed, \u201cGreat cheesecake.\u201d",
      "Apparently he never forgot it. In February, news broke that Dudamel \u2014 a singular figure both exalted in the insular classical-music world and adored by the public, and even granted his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame \u2014 would become the music and artistic director of the New York Philharmonic in 2026. (Trumpets blare!) As reported in The New York Times, when Dudamel returned to Lincoln Center to meet with his colleagues to be, ",
      " in his decision to cross the continent.",
      "Surely the powers that be at the Philharmonic had mustered many temptations in their campaign to win Dudamel away from the West Coast. But in the end, was it a humble cheesecake that tipped the scales? I reached out to my daughter\u2019s cello teacher, Wolfram Koessel, a member of the American String Quartet who regularly plays with the Philharmonic. \u201cHave you heard about this cheesecake?\u201d I texted.",
      "Immediately the phone rang. It turned out that Kitsopoulos was a close friend of Koessel\u2019s and made the same cheesecake six years ago when they were playing at a festival in Vail, Colo. He, too, never forgot it. Even though Kitsopoulos accidentally burned it \u2014 \u201cthe altitude,\u201d she said with a sigh when I asked her later \u2014 Koessel\u2019s daughter, then 8, still insists that it\u2019s the best cheesecake she\u2019s ever had.",
      "What kind of cheesecake withstands burning and triumphs, and sears itself into the memories of child and worldly wise alike? The ingredient list is brief: for the filling, only cream cheese, sugar and vanilla extract. And the crust isn\u2019t gently coaxed and toiled over. It comes from a can: crescent-roll dough, which pops out with a twist \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s so fun to open,\u201d Kitsopoulos said \u2014 unfurls, turns fluffy when baked and is somehow precision-engineered to evoke the rich, milky purity of the fattest butter (even if the dough might contain vegetable shortening instead).",
      "Unknown to Kitsopoulos, who grew up in New Jersey, she had stumbled on a Southwestern tradition: a mash-up of cheesecake and sopapillas, pieces of dough dropped into hot oil until they puff into little pillows and often served dusted with cinnamon sugar and dripping with honey. The origins of sopapillas, also spelled sopaipillas, go back to Latin America \u2014 the word is believed to derive from Mozarabic, a medieval Spanish-Arabic vernacular \u2014 and regions of the United States that were once part of Mexico. In 2003, Texas briefly proclaimed the sopaipilla as its official state pastry (alongside strudel) and \u201ca much-savored part of Texans\u2019 shared cultural identity.\u201d \u201cSopapilla cheesecake\u201d was the dish most Googled during Thanksgiving week in Texas and Oklahoma from 2004 to 2013. Oklahoma State University even features a recipe on its website, one of seemingly countless online.",
      "Kitsopoulos took a recipe from Pillsbury, developed by Deborah Harroun, the writer of the Taste and Tell blog. The cellist made a few adjustments: a little less sugar and a lot more cinnamon. Baking, like music, demands discipline and precision, but in the kitchen, Kitsopoulos is the least fussy of bakers, approximating more than measuring. Where Pillsbury advises first rolling out the dough for the topping on parchment paper, she just plops it on. \u201cI\u2019m so not an exact person,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m flying by the seat of my pants. Sometimes I forget I have something in the oven.\u201d",
      "In December, when the young Finnish maestro Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 came to town \u2014 \u201che looks exactly like my son,\u201d she said \u2014 she gave him brownies. \u201cHe had eight of them,\u201d she recalled in wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t think they give the guest conductors enough food.\u201d"

      "Balancing on the slippery, shimmering stones of the breathtaking bridge, with the cold waters of the Neretva River glistening far below, Amir Hanic pokes his nose up and takes his last breath. Without looking up or down, only straight ahead, he leaps from the bridge, his hands and feet stiff like the outstretched wings of a swooping bird.",
      "His descent lasts only a couple of seconds, but the audience surrounding him on the bridge has time to exclaim a collective \u201cOoh!\u201d \u2014 a mixture of admiration and fright. Amir disappears beneath the surface, then, reappearing, quickly swims back to shore, as if nothing had happened. Within moments, he\u2019s climbing back up to the bridge.",
      "With his plunge in the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, Amir and his friends from the local diving club are honoring a tradition that goes back some 400 years \u2014 \u201cto the Middle Ages, during the Ottoman era,\u201d says Amir, wiping his face with a towel. \u201cWe are protecting our cultural heritage and keeping the passage over the bridge clean.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are the guardians of the Mostar Bridge,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first recorded dive from the bridge in Mostar \u2014 known as the Old Bridge, or Stari Most \u2014 took place in the 17th century, around 100 years after its construction. Since 1968, the city has held an annual summer diving competition, which attracts participants from all over the world.",
      "Braving the drop of around 75 feet (it varies with the height of the river), this extreme stunt requires a healthy dose of courage. But as Amir ascends from the river to the bridge, walking past the ancient stone stairs, the picturesque streets, the backdrop of musicians in the bazaar, he has another task. With a hat in his hand, he collects donations from the crowd of onlookers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m done with diving today,\u201d he exclaims, still balancing on the edge of the bridge \u2014 but this time extending his arm toward the crowd. \u201cNow I have to raise some money for our club.\u201d",
      "When I traveled to Bosnia with the photographer Alessio Mamo in July 2021, much of our trip took place in the shadow of the violence that tore through the region in the 1990s, when, as Yugoslavia broke apart, war erupted between three ethnonationalist groups: Orthodox Christian Serbs, Catholic Croats and Bosniaks, or Bosnian Muslims.",

      "\u201cIt was much more difficult and dangerous to dive from the gangway,\u201d Admir tells me. \u201cYou had to take a run-up, with the risk of getting hurt.\u201d But even today, every dive is still a challenge, he says, requiring the utmost concentration.",
      "There are days when Admir dives as many as 10 or 12 times, he says, in the peak tourist season, between July and August.

Behind him on the wall are paintings and pictures of the bridge in different historical eras, and of divers during their marvelous feats.",

      "At times they look like superheroes, moving together to the rhythm of the music, conjuring tricks like magicians.",
      "I first heard of the Sea Clown Sailing Circus when I was following the stories of refugees crossing Greece. Members of the circus were performing at a camp in Athens, trying to win smiles from children who had experienced too much pain.",
      "Later, I joined the performers in the summer of 2020 on the storied island of Ithaca, in the Ionian Sea. Hoping to sail with the nomad crew, I happened to arrive the very day their engine broke down. Apparently it was a regular occurrence. A technician from the island mocked them: The engines were rusting from lack of use, he said.",
      "It was true that Fred Normal and Alvaro Ramirez, the captains, never wanted to use the engines, aiming instead to sail with the wind as much as possible \u2014 even while docking at and departing from the port.",
      "Twenty years earlier, in the United States, Fred, an Alaska-born circus performer, decided it was pointless to try to change the world while traveling with gas-guzzling trucks and caravans. Instead, he resolved to offer his form of utopia to people across the United States and Europe by bicycle. He rode around with his crew from one town to the next, staging pop-up shows and sleeping beside campfires.",
      "Eventually, on the Southern coast of Italy, he met Nikoleta Giakumeli, a Greek acrobat, and Alvaro, a Uruguayan clown who had been traveling around Europe. Together, the trio dreamed up the idea of a seaborne circus, even though none of them had ever formally sailed.",
      "So they learned. For 13 years, Fred and Nikoleta lived on their boat, Surloulou, through summers and winters. After the birth of their daughter, Sirena, who at the age of 4 is already climbing ropes and trying her first tricks as an acrobat, their lives changed dramatically. They now spend less time with the circus, which, despite their absence, continues reinventing itself with new performers and new ideas.",
      "Dozens of artists from all over the world are connected with the Sea Clown Sailing Circus. Some join the crew for only a few days; others join for the whole summer. But a core group of around seven or eight people are trying to bring the circus to a greater acclaim \u2014 not only by roaming freely from one Greek island to another, but also by producing more meaningful, and more philosophically engaging, shows.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when I joined the Sea Clowns again for a month, they were producing a new show based on Plato\u2019s ",
      ". I saw firsthand how dedicated the performers are to their craft. Though their performances often feel impromptu, the Sea Clowns are in fact immensely disciplined in their preparations. Every act \u2014 from acrobatic shows and fire juggling to aerial rope tricks and slacklining \u2014 requires a tremendous degree of skill and training. And they simply love to learn.",
      "Being a part of the crew requires being good at sailing, music or circus acts, and ideally all three. But what\u2019s most important is the ability to express enough humor, kindness and respect to live in proximity with a crew of curious artists every day without creating tensions.",
      "It\u2019s also a challenge, of course, to adapt to life on a shoestring budget. \u201cWe live or we die by the hat,\u201d Fred would say at the end of every show, inviting the public to offer a donation for the Sea Clowns\u2019 survival.",
      "The life of a street (or water) artist is fragile, delicate \u2014 like a tightrope act, or juggling with knives, or sailing through a storm. Yet for most of the crew, nothing seems to offer them a greater sense of freedom. The Sea Clowns ride with their sails open to the wind, confronting both their dreams and an unpredictable future.",
      "\u201cOur work aims to show that nothing is impossible,\u201d Alvaro said, \u201cunless your mind convinces you to believe the opposite.\u201d"

I can keep a sense of them as being distinct. But once I\u2019m back home, when I revisit the books after my trip, curiously, little by little, aspects from fiction that were distinct while I was traveling begin to converge with what I actually saw and heard on my journey. It is as if the strata of the land\u2019s history and the people who lived there have emerged through the pages of the novels.",

I hope these Tokyoites will reveal to you the many layers of the city and its past.",

      "With the influx of Western thought and ideas in the newly open Tokyo in the late 19th century, intellectuals wrestled with the conflicts that arose between traditional Confucian ideologies and contemporary European spirituality. Natsume Soseki taught literature at the University of Tokyo after studying abroad in London, and, when he later became an author, he brilliantly sublimated those very conflicts in his novels. Such ideological tensions are not, however, outwardly apparent in his fantastical short stories, \u201c",

The appeal of this work is its metafictional structure, which features a poignant relationship between a writer and a prostitute. Just when you think the story has ended, the author himself makes an appearance in order to relay various episodes from the ever-changing city as part of the plot. Here, too, a nesting-box narrative enables the reader to contemplate the passage of time.",
      "Now, at last, we are nearing the layers that make up present-day Tokyo. After Japan\u2019s defeat in World War II, the country again underwent drastic changes. The narrator of Kenzaburo Oe\u2019s novel \u201c",
      "\u201d is a young man who has assassinated a politician. The novel is a detailed portrayal of a young man who is adrift, descending into depression and being driven to terrorism. The story alludes to an event that occurred not long before it was published, in which the chairman of the Japan Socialist Party was stabbed to death by an ultranationalist at Tokyo\u2019s Hibiya Public Hall. There were many protests and threats made against Oe himself after \u201cSeventeen\u201d was published, in a literary journal. Despite having been translated into various languages and published in numerous countries, the novel was only made available in Japan in book form four years ago \u2014 57 years after it was written \u2014 when it was included in a collected edition of Oe\u2019s complete works.",

      "\u201d by Taeko Kono, is about a woman who suddenly learns that she will die the following day, and describes how she spends the hours after that realization. In spite of its terrible premise, the story is surprisingly tranquil and matter of fact. I have often heard people say that it is difficult to tell what a Japanese person is thinking, and this woman is no exception: She does not let her feelings show. Whenever I reread this story, I always marvel at how Kono chose to illustrate the workings of this woman\u2019s mind with such audacious and sophisticated creativity.",

Nevertheless, Mukoda skillfully captures these Tokyo women who, nearing the end of the 20th century and at a time of economic prosperity in Japan, continue to struggle to improve their standing.

It contains uninhabited forests and densely built-up zones and areas with vestiges of the early 20th-century city. Reading these 10 stories set in modern-day Tokyo makes me feel as though I\u2019ve returned home after a long journey. This is us, in Tokyo now. Yet, we\u2019re still traveling.

      ": \u201cThe BBC routinely misrepresents the monarchy and public opinion. They suggest the nation is celebrating major events when that simply isn\u2019t the case.\u201d",
      "While the BBC rejects these claims of partiality, there is little doubt that as digital technology has advanced over many years, the broadcaster\u2019s royal coverage has become ever more sophisticated and comprehensive. The medium, in other words, has facilitated a kind of blanket coverage of a message that would not have been possible in the 1950s.",
      "In 1953, the queen\u2019s coronation unfolded in a nation in thrall to a newfangled miracle called television. British baby boomers, many of them small children at the time, like to recall that television in those days meant a small black-and-white screen in a large wooden cabinet broadcasting a single channel. The British establishment \u2014 including its nobles and priests, as well as the BBC \u2014 wielded exclusive control of the monochrome footage that would mold a generation\u2019s memory of the event.",

      "Since then, the royal House of Windsor has changed radically from \u201ca magical monarchy to a public service monarchy,\u201d Bogdanor said, and \u201cis judged by whether it contributes to society, and if it doesn\u2019t, people won\u2019t have it.\u201d King Charles, he added, seems \u201cwell aware of that.\u201d",
      "For the king, a helter-skelter technological revolution has transformed every smartphone owner into a pocket cinematographer, hooked to a multiplex world of apps and platforms, uploads and downloads. Where his mother\u2019s crowning bathed the monarchy in uncontested splendor, Charles\u2019s challenge is to focus a much more diffuse spotlight.",

The Bruins scored three consecutive goals and looked poised to advance, but defenseman Brandon Montour forced overtime by scoring his second goal of the game with less than a minute left, and the goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky was sent to the bench for an extra attacker.",
      "By losing in the first round, the Bruins were dealt the same fate of the ",
      ", who had shared the previous record for single-season wins with the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings. That Tampa Bay team crashed out in a four-game sweep to Columbus, inspiring an apology to the fans on social media. Of the four teams to win at least 60 games in a season, only one, the star-laden 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens, went on to win the Stanley Cup.",
      "This year\u2019s Bruins, under their first-year coach, Jim Montgomery, also had talent throughout their roster. Five players had at least 20 goals, and five had at least 40 assists. David Pastrnak, the star winger who signed an eight-year contract extension last month, led both those categories with career highs of 61 goals and 52 assists. ",

      "Boston will now enter an off-season with important questions to answer. The team does not have much salary cap space, and its unrestricted free agents include two members of its most recent championship team \u2014\u00a0Patrice Bergeron, the 37-year-old captain and a top defensive forward; and David Krejci, who had a goal and two assists on Sunday.

      "A new study of genetic data from a market in Wuhan, China, said the data did not support the case that the pandemic had started with illegally traded animals, touching off fresh debate about samples that other scientists see as critical pieces of the puzzle of how the coronavirus reached humans.",
      "The ",
      ", which examined the relative amounts of animal and viral material in swabs taken from surfaces at the market in early 2020, said it was difficult to draw conclusions about whether given samples of the virus had come from infected live animals or were simply from incidental contamination.",
      "But several outside experts said the analysis, posted online this week by the study\u2019s author, Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, could have been affected by a number of unknown variables and decisions about how to filter the data.",
      "For those reasons, they said, the findings did not do much to sway their impression of previous studies. Samples from the market containing animal and viral genetic material, they said, were consistent with the possibility that an animal there \u2014 perhaps a raccoon dog \u2014 had spread the virus to people, but did not prove that had happened.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty reasonable chance they picked up an infected raccoon dog, but that doesn\u2019t prove that was the origin,\u201d said Frederic Bushman, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in analyzing samples like those taken from the Wuhan market, but who was not involved in any of the market studies. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Bloom paper changes my thinking that much.\u201d",
      "Chinese researchers ",
      " last year and then made the genetic sequences available this year, allowing a team of international scientists to study them. That team ",
      " last month that based on the data, they could not conclusively identify an animal that had passed the virus to people.",
      "But they said the data confirmed that animals believed to be susceptible to the virus, like raccoon dogs and masked palm civets, a small Asian mammal implicated in the SARS outbreak two decades ago, were being sold at the market in late 2019. Many of the earliest Covid-19 patients also worked or shopped at the market.",
      "Because the market was one of only four places in Wuhan reported to be selling live animals of the sort that could plausibly spread the virus, the scientists said it was unlikely that so many early patients were linked to the market purely by chance. They said the genetic data also built on other evidence, including that two early lineages of the virus had been at the market.",
      "This week\u2019s study took a different approach to analyzing the gene sequences.",
      "Dr. Bloom investigated whether the amount of genetic material from the virus correlated with the amount of genetic material from susceptible animal species in the samples. If one species at the market was overwhelmingly responsible for shedding the virus, he said\u00a0in an interview, he would have expected to see a clear link between the amount of genetic material from the virus and the amount from that species.",
      "But the study found no clear correlations\u00a0of that kind. Instead, the strongest correlations involved various fish sold at the market that could not have been infected, an indication that infected people had probably deposited viral material where the fish was.",
      "Dr. Bloom said that finding suggested that the virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, was spread widely across the market by the time the swabs were collected in early 2020.",
      "\u201cIn the same way we shouldn\u2019t read much of anything into the fact that there\u2019s a bunch of SARS-CoV-2 mixed with largemouth bass and catfish samples, we also shouldn\u2019t read much into the fact that there\u2019s a raccoon dog sample with a SARS-CoV-2 read,\u201d Dr. Bloom said.",
      "But outside experts said that various features of the samples could throw off efforts to correlate animal and viral material. The international scientists said in their report that they had considered running a similar analysis, but that it risked producing misleading results. Dr. Bloom acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s an open question of whether that is an informative thing to calculate at all.\u201d",
      "Genetic material from the virus degrades quickly, said Christopher Mason, a specialist in environmental sampling at Weill Cornell Medicine. Crucially, viral material may decay at a different rate than material from animals, making it difficult to compare them in samples collected over the course of weeks after the market\u2019s closure.",
      "It could be that fish were most closely associated with the virus simply because the fish were likely to have been frozen or refrigerated, slowing the decay of viral material in those samples, said Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist at KU Leuven in Belgium.",
      "The latest analysis \u201cconfirms that looking at these sorts of correlations tells you next to nothing with respect to which host species could have been a plausible source of the pandemic,\u201d Dr. Wenseleers said. This leaves scientists in the same situation as before, he said, with market data that doesn\u2019t offer conclusive evidence of any particular origin scenario.",
      "The new study also looked closely at a swab from a cart at the market in which the international team had found a\u00a0trace\u00a0of the virus alongside genetic signatures of raccoon dogs, but no detectable genetic material from humans.",
      "Dr. Bloom wrote that the swab had only a minuscule amount of viral material, and that it was not clear why Chinese researchers had classified the swab as Covid-positive. His study said that swab was the only one that had substantial amounts of raccoon dog genetic material with any traces of the virus.",
      "Some scientists, though, said Dr. Bloom\u2019s analysis risked dismissing other Covid-positive swabs by setting too high of a bar for the amount of animal genetic material in a sample.",
      "Dr. Bushman, of the University of Pennsylvania, said that the threshold used in the analysis was \u201caggressive\u201d and that it was best to compare results obtained from a series of different cutoffs.",
      "Using a more sensitive threshold, the international team of scientists identified multiple\u00a0Covid-positive samples containing raccoon dog genetic material, as well as others with genetic signatures of different\u00a0animals\u00a0thought to be susceptible to the virus.",
      "Alexander Crits-Christoph, a computational biologist formerly at Johns Hopkins University who helped lead the international team\u2019s analysis, said the team also looked closely at whether the Chinese researchers had been right to describe the swab from the cart as positive for the virus.",
      "He noted that a number of other swabs from the same stall were clearly positive for the virus. He said results from sampling elsewhere in the market also indicated that unlike the swab from the cart, most of the truly negative swabs contained no traces of the virus at all.",
      "\u201cThis is environmental sampling of a virus that is a tiny needle in a haystack,\u201d Dr. Crits-Christoph said."

      "Texas was gasping for electricity. Winter Storm Uri had knocked out power plants across the state, leaving tens of thousands of homes in icy darkness. By the end of Feb. 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died, some from the freezing cold.",
      "Meanwhile, in the husk of a onetime aluminum smelting plant an hour outside of Austin, row upon row of computers were using enough electricity to power about 6,500 homes as they raced to earn Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.",
      "The computers were performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for an elusive combination of numbers that Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm would accept. About every 10 minutes, a computer somewhere guesses correctly and wins a small number of Bitcoins worth, in recent weeks, about $170,000. Anyone can try, but to make a business of it can require as much electricity as a small city.",
      "In Texas, the computers kept running until just after midnight. Then the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them shut off, under an agreement that allowed it to do so if the system was about to fail. In return, it began paying the Bitcoin company, Bitdeer, an average of $175,000 an hour to keep the computers offline. Over the next four days, Bitdeer would make more than $18 million for not operating, from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm.",
      "The New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as Bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs \u2014 including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution \u2014 for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with Bitcoin.",
      "Until June 2021, most Bitcoin mining was in China. Then it drove out Bitcoin operations, at least for a time, citing their power use among other reasons. The United States quickly became the industry\u2019s global leader.",
      "Since then, precisely how much electricity Bitcoin mines are using in America and their effect on energy markets and the environment have been unclear. The Times, using both public and confidential records as well as the results of studies it commissioned, put the most comprehensive estimates to date on the largest operations\u2019 power use and the ripple effects of their voracious demand.",
      "It is as if another New York City\u2019s worth of residences were now drawing on the nation\u2019s power supply, The Times found.",
      "In some areas, this has led prices to surge. In Texas, where 10 of the 34 mines are connected to the state\u2019s grid, the increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly 5 percent, or $1.8 billion per year, according to a simulation performed for The Times by the energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.",
      "The additional power use across the country also causes as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to America\u2019s roads, according to an analysis by WattTime, a nonprofit tech company. Many of the Bitcoin operations promote themselves as environmentally friendly and set up in areas rich with renewable energy, but their power needs are far too great to be satisfied by those sources alone. As a result, they have become a boon for the fossil fuel industry: WattTime found that coal and natural gas plants kick in to meet 85 percent of the demand these Bitcoin operations add to their grids.",
      "Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, like factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.",
      "In some states, notably New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, Bitcoin operators\u2019 revenue can ultimately come from other power customers. The clearest example is Texas, where Bitcoin companies are paid by the grid operator for promising to quickly power down if necessary to prevent blackouts. In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down and instead earn additional money while doing exactly what they would have been doing anyway: seeking Bitcoin. Five operations have collectively made at least $60 million from that program since 2020, records show.",
      "Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.",
      "The windfall for Bitdeer during Winter Storm Uri came through this program, in exchange for a fraction of the power it typically used. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Another Bitcoin company made tens of millions of dollars reselling electricity during the storm \u2014 and ultimately stands to earn as much as $125 million \u2014 according to its financial filings, which were previously reported by the ",
      ". A third company ",
      " that another natural disaster like Uri could be a significant business opportunity.",
      "\u201cIronically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid,\u201d said Ed Hirs, who teaches energy economics at the University of Houston and has been critical of the industry.",
      "In interviews and statements, many of the companies said they were no different from other large power users except for their willingness to shut off quickly to benefit the grid. Several objected to the method The Times and WattTime used to estimate their emissions, which calculated the pollution caused by the additional power generated to satisfy the mines\u2019 demand, showing it to overwhelmingly come from fossil fuels.",
      "The companies said this method held them to an unfair standard.",
      "\u201cThe analysis cited could be used to attack any industry that consumes power,\u201d said David Fogel, the chief executive of Coinmint, which operates in upstate New York. \u201cI think the entire notion of singling out specific industries like this is unfair.\u201d",
      "But WattTime\u2019s method is the one many energy and climate experts recommend for measuring the environmental effects of increased power use by any industry, particularly one that grows so large so suddenly.",
      "Some in the industry have pushed back against suggestions that it is directly responsible for any environmental harm.",
      "A May 2022 ",
      " to the Environmental Protection Agency, signed by many of the biggest companies, said their operations \u201creleased\u201d no pollutants. \u201cBitcoin miners have no emissions whatsoever,\u201d it said. \u201cAssociated emissions are a function of electricity generation.\u201d",
      "Nic Carter, a partner at a crypto-focused venture capital firm and a",
      "prominent Bitcoin advocate who told The Times he was the letter\u2019s primary author, said he was playing a \u201clanguage game\u201d when he wrote that Bitcoin mining has no emissions. At the time, he said, he felt the industry was being unfairly singled out.",
      "\u201cMaybe the more sincere point is like, we\u2019re already fully aware of the emissions associated with utilities generating grid power,\u201d he said.",
      "Many academics who study the energy industry said Bitcoin mining was undoubtedly having significant environmental effects.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re adding hundreds of megawatts of new demand when we already face the need to rapidly cut fossil power,\u201d said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor who studies electrical grid emissions.",
      "\u201cIf you care about climate change,\u201d he added, \u201cthen that\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "Bitcoin, conceived in 2008, introduced most of the world to the concept of cryptocurrencies. Instead of trusting banks to track the value of accounts, the system publishes transactions on a public ledger called a blockchain. Proponents said that cutting out middlemen would free people from financial institutions, government oversight and fees.",
      "So-called mining is a fundamental part of the system: When a computer guesses correctly, it updates the ledger and collects six and a quarter new Bitcoins. Then the guessing game begins again.",
      "Initially, hobbyists could win with personal computers, but as the value of each Bitcoin soared \u2014 from under $1,000 in 2017 to above $60,000 in 2021 \u2014 mining increasingly became an industrial endeavor. (The price has since dropped and, as of publication, was roughly $28,000.)",
      "The only way for miners to better their odds is to add computing power, which requires more electricity. But as the number of guesses increases, the algorithm makes the game more difficult. This has created an energy arms race.",
      "The mines\u2019 scale can draw gasps from people in the power industry. A one-megawatt mine consumes more energy each day than a typical U.S. home does in two years. The electricity coursing through a 100-megawatt operation at a given moment could power about half the homes in Cleveland, according to federal data.",
      "Aspects of the industry have previously been ",
      " in news articles and ",
      " and ",
      ", including broad estimates of the environmental effects. But The Times cross-referenced financial disclosures, land records and satellite imagery to create the first national accounting of the biggest operations. The analysis includes mines operating at approximately 40 megawatts or higher, although dozens more exist below that threshold.",
      "Of course, other industries, including metals and plastics manufacturing, also require large amounts of electricity, causing pollution and raising power prices. But Bitcoin mines bring significantly fewer jobs, often employing only a few dozen people once construction is complete, and spur less local economic development.",
      "Their financial benefit flows almost exclusively to their owners and operators. In 2021, the year Bitcoin\u2019s price peaked, 20 executives at five publicly traded Bitcoin companies together received nearly $16 million in salary and over $630 million in stock options, records show.",
      "The industry has been less profitable since then, as Bitcoin\u2019s value has dropped and electricity prices have climbed. Two of the largest United States-based companies have filed for bankruptcy. Still, new mines continue to open across the country",
      "There are ways to operate a cryptocurrency using far less electricity. Last year, Ethereum, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, reduced the electricity needed to power the network by more than 99 percent by switching its algorithm. Now it rewards people and trusts them to update the ledger because they are willing to put up their own money as collateral, not because they have spent money to power guessing computers, as Bitcoin does.",
      "But Bitcoin advocates oppose changing their algorithm, saying that it has proved resistant to attacks for longer and at a greater scale than any other approach. In practice, they say, the more computers making guesses, the safer the network.",
      "As Bitcoin mining has spread, countries around the world have found that operations strained their power grids. In 2019, China declared the industry \u201c",
      "\u201d and banned it in 2021. Many operations moved to ",
      " and ",
      ", which also enacted restrictions.",
      "And shipping pallets piled high with Bitcoin-mining computers ",
      ", where some states welcomed them in.",
      "Just north of Jamestown, N.D., the land is flat, trees are scarce and, in winter, snow drifts can easily top 10 feet. Even when brisk prairie winds blow, the shrill whine of the fans within Applied Digital\u2019s Bitcoin mine can be heard a half-mile away.",
      "They are working to cool more than 30,000 computers, stacked two stories high, stretching for hundreds of feet alongside signs that read \u201cDanger \u2014 High Voltage.\u201d The radiating heat melts the snow on one side of each of the operation\u2019s eight buildings.",
      "The mine has 33 employees and uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as all the homes in the 16,000-person town. It is one of three mines in the state that together consume nearly as much power as every home in North Dakota.",
      "Few other states have been as welcoming to Bitcoin companies. In October 2021, Gov. Doug Burgum presented an ",
      " to local officials and a power provider for bringing a mine to Grand Forks. Months later, he announced the development of a $1.9 billion Bitcoin operation in Williston. And last spring, he ",
      " a switch at the Jamestown mine\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony.",
      "The Bitcoin operations\u2019 effect on the state\u2019s economy is simple, said Josh Teigen, the commerce commissioner: \u201cThey are propping up our fossil fuel industry, and that\u2019s exactly what we want.\u201d",
      "North Dakota has an abundance of lignite, a type of coal primarily used to generate electricity. Mr. Teigen said the state hopes to ultimately",
      "capture the carbon from fossil fuel power plants and store it underground, reducing emissions while keeping the coal industry alive",
      "The state also has a large amount of wind power, which is what attracted",
      "Applied Digital, said Wes Cummins, its chief executive.",
      "His company is not alone. Many Bitcoin businesses promote their ability to operate in rural areas where renewable energy is abundant.",
      "But those claims have hit a hard reality: A vast majority of that renewable energy would be used even in the absence of the mines, so fossil fuel plants almost always need to produce additional electricity as a result of their operations.",
      "For example, the Jamestown mine\u2019s power demand causes coal or natural gas energy providers to generate electricity more than 90 percent of the time, WattTime found.",
      "Using a technique known as ",
      ", WattTime examined each mine\u2019s location and power use, identified which types of power plants had generated the additional energy needed, and estimated the resulting pollution. That method, and WattTime in particular, were recommended in a report by the Crypto Climate Accord, an initiative to reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint supported by more than 200 cryptocurrency companies.",
      "The analysis found that the 34 mines\u2019 power use was causing nearly 16.4 million tons of carbon pollution each year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d Mr. Cummins said, when told the estimates for Applied Digital\u2019s Jamestown operation. He said his operation uses the electricity that is available on the grid and cannot control whether it comes from clean or dirty sources, which is affected by all customers\u2019 demand. The miners generally prefer calculating emissions based on that mix of power.",
      "Using that method, WattTime estimated that they consume 54 percent fossil fuel-generated power, resulting in nearly 10.4 million tons of carbon emissions.",
      "Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, a Bitcoin lobbying group, said in an email that the industry incentivizes the development of new renewable and natural gas plants. But power industry experts say that while some current wind farms may be benefiting modestly, renewable generation takes years to build and usually requires commitments from customers who can guarantee that they will buy power for a decade or more.",
      "According to Dr. Jenkins at Princeton, the Bitcoin operations\u2019 near-constant power demand is more likely to keep fossil fuel plants in business than to lead to more renewable energy.",
      "This proved true in upstate New York, where a gas-powered plant reopened and now powers a Bitcoin mine. Three other large operations are run by companies that also own the fossil fuel plants where they operate, including two burning waste coal in Pennsylvania.",
      "Some of the Bitcoin companies that WattTime found to be causing the most pollution have held themselves out as supporting renewables.",
      "For example, Riot Platforms\u2019 chief executive described Bitcoin mining as \u201cuniquely beneficial and supportive of renewable energy.\u201d Ninety-six percent of the power demand added by the company\u2019s mine was met by fossil fuels, the WattTime analysis showed.",
      "Mining Bitcoin produces steady revenue, but using so much electricity can also be a business model.",
      "Moments of extreme weather provide especially stark examples. Take June 23, 2022 \u2014 the eighth straight day of near-100-degree temperatures around Austin, which allowed Riot Platforms to demonstrate several ways they can turn electricity into money.",
      "Like many industrial buyers, the company had prepurchased its power at a fraction of the price available to residential customers. Riot\u2019s mine runs at 450 megawatts \u2014 the largest in the country.",
      "Each day that June, its computers\u2019 guesses were winning Bitcoin worth an average of about",
      "$342,000. But the company had two additional ways to improve its profit margins.",
      "First, it had signed up for the Responsive Reserve Service, a Texas power grid program that offers a way to quickly reduce strain if the grid becomes overloaded, acting as insurance against blackouts. The program pays miners, and other companies, for promising to stop using electricity upon request. In reality, they are rarely asked to shut down, but are still paid for making the pledge.",
      "From midnight to nearly 4 p.m. on June 23, Riot earned more than $42,000 from the program while continuing to mine Bitcoin. (Overall in 2022, Riot made nearly $9.3 million from participating in the program nearly 85 percent of the time, the data shows, though the grid operator asked companies to actually lower their use for about 3.5 hours.)",
      "Around that time, the company switched to the second technique: avoiding fees that Texas charges to maintain and strengthen the power grid. It did so by briefly shutting off almost completely.",
      "To incentivize big customers to conserve electricity, those fees are based on how much electricity they use during several peak summer moments. Riot reduced its power use by more than 99 percent.",
      "By 6:30 p.m., the company had resumed mining. If Riot had been fully operating all day, it would have incurred an estimated $5.5 million in fees \u2014 costs that are largely made up by other Texans. Over the course of the year, this saved Riot more than $27 million in potential fees.",
      "The company\u2019s actions were described in data published by the Texas grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT. Though the records refer to power suppliers by pseudonyms, The Times was able to identify six of the 10 Texas operations in the data.",

Taken together, Mr. Lula\u2019s moves amount less to an attempt to thwart the West than to advance Brazil\u2019s national interests, as well as a commitment to alleviate poverty and hunger in the Global South. In line with the country\u2019s history of multilateralism and sensitive to its needs, Mr. Lula is charting his own course.",

In this project, China is an obvious ally.",

At the New Development Bank ceremony, ",

      "This being Albany, of course, the closed-door negotiations centered much less on the state\u2019s finances than they did on contentious policy changes that were stuffed into the final budget legislation.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "For the third time since 2019, New York amended its bail laws to make it easier for judges to hold people accused of crimes while they await trial.",
      "This year\u2019s change removed language that required judges to set the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d conditions necessary to ensure defendants did not flee prosecution, instead urging them to choose what they believe is \u201cnecessary to reasonably assure\u201d defendants\u2019 return to court, as they did before the 2019 changes to the bail law.",
      "And while the law maintains the 2019 prohibition against setting bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felonies, it will nonetheless invite judges to set harsher release conditions for all crimes \u2014 higher bail for those crimes where bail may be set, and more restrictive conditions, like monitoring, where it cannot.",
      "It is not yet clear just how much impact these revisions will have in practice: Judges are still limited by the language that defines bail as a tool to ensure that a defendant returns to court. Judges must also still consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay.",
      "But some opponents believe that judges who were looking for reasons to keep people in jail could view these changes, and the governor\u2019s signaling around them, as justification to do so.",
      "The state\u2019s minimum wage is going up by a few dollars, gradually, over a few years. It will then be pegged to inflation, mimicking an approach in a growing number of states.",

      "The amount of the increase upset labor unions and progressive Democrats who were seeking to boost the minimum wage above $20, arguing inflation had made it increasingly hard for poor and working-class New Yorkers to stay afloat.",

Retailers may also be fined two to three times the amount of tax that would have been collected. Landlords who permit unlicensed shops in their premises could be on the hook for $10,000 a day in fines.",

The law, the first statewide ban in the nation, will go into effect for buildings under seven stories beginning in 2026; larger buildings will need to comply by 2029. It will not affect gas stoves in existing homes and includes exceptions for manufacturing, emergency generators and hospitals, among others.",

But investors and economists think that this could be the central bank\u2019s last move before it pauses.",
      "Fed officials face a complicated backdrop going into this week\u2019s meeting: Risks to the financial system loom large, but inflation also remains stubborn.",

      "Some of the banking sector tumult stems from the Fed\u2019s rapid interest rate increases over the past year. Central bankers are expected to lift rates to just above 5 percent this week, up from near-zero as recently as March 2022. After that quick series of adjustments, many lenders are facing losses on older securities and loans, which pay relatively low interest rates compared with newer securities issued in a higher-rate world.",

      "If officials adjust policy as expected this week, they will have lifted rates to that level. The question now is whether they deem that sufficient, or whether policymakers think that the economy and inflation are resilient enough that they will need to adjust borrowing costs more to cool things down and lower inflation fully.",

      " that they expected the economy to experience a \u201cmild recession\u201d in the wake of the recent banking turmoil. And Fed officials \u2014 including Mr. Powell \u2014 have suggested that a recession is possible as officials try to slow the economy enough to bring inflation under control.",
      "But if a recession hits, it is not obvious how painful it will be. Some economists warn that downturns usually build on themselves, as people respond to a little bit of economic weakness by pulling back on spending a lot: It may be hard to push the unemployment rate up just a little bit without pushing it significantly.",
      "Others point out that the post-pandemic economy is a weird one, characterized by unusually strong corporate profits and lots of job openings. Because there may be room to squeeze margins and cut unfilled positions, the economy may be able to cool down more gently than in the past \u2014 a so-called \u201csoft landing.\u201d",
      "Mr. Powell will get a chance to weigh in on which outcome he thinks is most likely on Wednesday."

      "The stage was set for Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers to call additional witnesses to bolster her case.",
      "Monday was the second of two days of cross-examination of Ms. Carroll by lawyer Joseph Tacopina about her allegation that the ex-president raped her in a dressing room in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has avoided coming to court, has denied all wrongdoing. On Monday morning, the former president\u2019s lawyers filed an unsuccessful motion for a mistrial, arguing that the court had made \u201cpervasive unfair and prejudicial rulings.\u201d ",
      "Ms. Carroll says she visited Bergdorf Goodman one evening in the mid-1990s. As she was leaving through a revolving door, Mr. Trump entered and recognized her, the suit says, and persuaded her to help him shop for a gift for a female friend. ",
      " in a dressing room in the lingerie department.",
      "Mr. Tacopina, in his questioning, focused on Ms. Carroll\u2019s memory of what happened that day some 30 years ago. On Monday, he used his cross-examination to point out inconsistencies between her testimony and her previous interviews and depositions, trying to suggest that she had benefited from making the allegation.",
      "Mr. Tacopina asked about her 2019 appearance on an episode of a podcast called \u201cThe Maris Review,\u201d during which Ms. Carroll said her life was \u201cfabulous.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is the way I present myself to the world,\u201d Ms. Carroll testified. \u201cI do not want anyone to know that I suffered,\u201d she added.",

      "Mr. Tacopina appeared to struggle to get into any sort of rhythm during his cross-examination, with Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers frequently objecting to questions and the judge sustaining those objections. At times, Mr. Tacopina struggled to even get his team to display evidence for the court.",
      "Judge Lewis A. Kaplan denied a motion filed by Mr. Tacopina asking him to declare a mistrial.",
      "Among other complaints, Mr. Tacopina argued that the judge mischaracterized evidence to favor Ms. Carroll and improperly bolster her testimony; allowed her to note that Mr. Trump had two tables\u2019 worth of lawyers while prohibiting the defense from noting she had a similar number; and wrongly sustained \u201cargumentative\u201d objections to his questions.",
      "\u201cThere comes a point where the cumulative effect of its one-sided rulings manifests a deeper leaning towards one party or another,\u201d Mr. Tacopina wrote.",

      "Last April, Jack Reid, a 17-year-old junior at one of the nation\u2019s elite boarding schools, tucked a Bible into his gym shorts and a note into his pocket directing his parents to a Google document explaining his feelings of despair. Then, inside his dorm room, he took his own life.",
      "On Sunday, the anniversary of Jack\u2019s death, the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey offered an extraordinary admission of failure, publicly acknowledging that it had been aware that Jack was being bullied by other students, but that it had fallen \u201ctragically short\u201d of its obligation to protect him.",
      "\u201cThe school acknowledges that bullying and unkind behavior, and actions taken or not taken by the school, likely contributed to Jack\u2019s death,\u201d Lawrenceville officials wrote in a ",
      " on the school\u2019s website.",
      "The school committed to taking a series of corrective actions including endowing a new dean\u2019s position that will be focused on mental health issues, with a goal of becoming a model for anti-bullying and student mental health.",
      "The statement was part of a negotiated settlement with Jack\u2019s parents, Elizabeth and Bill Reid.",
      "It offered a candid and detailed catalog of the school\u2019s missteps before Jack\u2019s death and a window into the culture of a private institution where tuition plus room and board top $76,000 a year. It also represents shifting attitudes surrounding the ",
      " and the ",
      " in an always complex set of factors that can contribute to suicide.",
      "\u201cWe feel like we both have life sentences without the possibility of parole,\u201d Dr. Reid, a clinical psychologist, said in an interview in which her husband also participated. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019d love to change here is to get Jack back. I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI do know if he were alive, he would want me \u2014 both of us \u2014 to try to make something good out of this and honor him in the way he lived his life.\u201d",
      "Richard Lieberman, the lead suicide prevention expert for the public school system in Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second-largest system, called Lawrenceville\u2019s response rare \u2014 and courageous. He said he had never before heard of a school\u2019s accepting responsibility so publicly after a suicide.",
      "\u201cWe need to talk more about this. We really do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a leading cause of death of our youth.\u201d",
      "Jack was bullied over the course of a year, the school said in the statement posted on Sunday.",
      "After his suicide, the school\u2019s board of trustees retained the law firm Petrillo Klein & Boxer to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death. The investigation included interviews with 45 students, faculty members and others, according to a detailed report on its findings, which the school provided to The New York Times.",
      "The firm also reviewed emails from more than 100 students and school personnel, as well as Jack\u2019s personal emails, phone records, text messages and internet searches, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe said from the beginning, \u2018Let\u2019s seek the truth and follow it where it leads us. Period,\u2019 \u201d Stephen S. Murray, Lawrenceville\u2019s head of school, said on Sunday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to do every step of the way.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis happened on my watch and I\u2019m grief stricken. And yet I can\u2019t begin to compare that to the grief and sorrow of Bill and Elizabeth Reid.\u201d",
      "Lawrenceville\u2019s statement said that its settlement with the Reids was aimed at \u201chonoring Jack, taking appropriate responsibility and instituting meaningful changes that will support the school\u2019s aspirations of becoming a model for anti-bullying and student mental health.\u201d",
      "The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated an already worrying mental ",

      " were always complex and were never tied to only one stressor.",
      "\u201cBullying absolutely can be an important factor that can be part of the multi-factor convergence of things that culminates in suicide,\u201d Dr. Moutier said in an interview, speaking generally and not about Jack Reid\u2019s death or any other specific incident. \u201cBut it is not thought, in any case of suicide, to be the sole cause.\u201d",
      "The law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink, which represented the Reids, declined to comment on the settlement or whether it included a payment by the school to the family.",
      "Lawrenceville enrolls about 830 students on a spacious campus in western New Jersey, between Trenton and Princeton. It is considered by the school-ranking website Niche to be among the nation\u2019s ",
      ". Before enrolling in Lawrenceville as a sophomore, Jack attended the Buckley School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where he was recalled as a leader who consistently stood out for his kindness. Roughly 900 people attended a funeral service, Jack\u2019s parents said, and 1,500 more watched it online.",
      "Jack\u2019s early days at Lawrenceville, where he arrived as a 10th grader in the fall of 2020, were happy ones, his parents said. He made friends and the dean\u2019s list.",
      "But in the spring of 2021, a persistent and untrue rumor that Jack was a rapist spread widely throughout the student body and led to cruel comments from some students, according to his parents.",
      "In September 2021, when he returned to school as a junior, he was nonetheless elected president of Dickinson House, one of the residential houses where the school\u2019s boarding students live. That appears to have increased animosity among some of his classmates and caused the rumor to spread further, his parents said.",
      "A few days after the election, the unfounded rape accusation was posted anonymously to a nationwide, student-run app popular with boarding-school students, Jack\u2019s parents said.",
      "The bullying spread quickly online, his parents said, and at Christmastime, during a secret Santa gift exchange among Lawrenceville classmates, Jack received a rape whistle and a book about how to make friends.",
      "Mr. Reid recalled that his son was hurt deeply, and that when Jack came home for Christmas he seemed withdrawn. \u201cDad, will this ever go away?\u201d he said his son asked him, \u201cWill it ever get off the website?\u201d",
      "Mr. Reid noted that the in-person bullying at school combined with the power of the internet posting compounded the rumor\u2019s impact.",
      "\u201cWe think bullying, with the 1,000 times echo chamber of the internet and everybody knowing, is much more devastating to kids and, in Jack\u2019s case, produced a very impulsive act,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had to escape the pain from the humiliation he was feeling.\u201d",
      "Early on, with support from his parents, Jack approached school officials and asked them to intervene, leading to a school-led investigation surrounding the bullying and the sexual assault allegation.",
      "The school inquiry found that the claim was bogus, and a classmate involved in spreading the rumors, who was later expelled for an unrelated violation of school rules, was formally disciplined for bullying Jack, according to the school\u2019s statement.",
      "But Lawrenceville never told Jack or his family \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 that the investigation had concluded that the rumors involving a sexual assault were utterly false.",
      "\u201cThere were steps that the school should in hindsight have taken but did not, including the fact that the school did not make a public or private statement that it investigated and found rumors about Jack that were untrue,\u201d Lawrenceville said in the statement.",
      "The school and the Reids also tried unsuccessfully to get comments related to the sexual assault claims removed from the app.",
      "The school also acknowledged that it had erred more specifically on the night Jack took his life, just hours after the classmate involved in the bullying was formally expelled. Instead of being supervised as he packed his belongings, the boy was permitted to participate in a drawn-out farewell that included a final run around campus and a group photograph. During the gathering, some students also made harsh comments about Jack, inaccurately blaming him for the boy\u2019s expulsion.",
      "\u201cSchool administrators did not notify or check on Jack,\u201d the school\u2019s statement acknowledged. \u201cThat night, Jack took his life, telling a friend that he could not go through this again.\u201d",
      "Dr. Reid said that Jack had been seeing a therapist at the time of his death because of the bullying, but that he had never discussed killing himself. Jack also displayed none of the underlying factors that might have indicated he was at risk for suicide, she said.",
      "The school said that it would contribute to a foundation the Reid family has established that will focus on education and prevention of bullying, and that it would make a recurring gift to a mental health organization to support research and best practices for suicide prevention in school environments.",
      "Public schools in most states are governed by laws that regulate the investigation and response to behavior considered bullying and require instruction aimed at limiting its spread.",
      "But private, parochial and boarding schools have far more autonomy in deciding how to address bullying.",
      "Mr. Reid said that the family also hoped to lobby for legislation in New York and New Jersey in an effort to broaden laws tied to bullying at private schools.",
      "Lawrenceville said in its statement that it would contract with a specialist to draft policies to identify and address behaviors that lead to school bullying and cyberbullying.",
      "\u201cWe acknowledge,\u201d the school said, \u201cthat more should have been done to protect Jack.\u201d"

      "A mechanic was charged with criminally negligent homicide on Tuesday in the death of an apprentice who was crushed when an elevator car plunged six stories during a maintenance operation.",
      "Prosecutors said the mechanic, Peter Milatz, 67, did not follow proper safety procedures before or during the operation, which caused the elevator car to free-fall down its shaft and kill Joseph Rosa, 25, an apprentice, in February 2021.",
      "\u201cJobs in this field can be extremely dangerous, and workers must be protected,\u201d the Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, said in a statement. ",
      "Mr. Milatz was arraigned on Tuesday in Bronx Supreme Court before Justice George Villegas. Brian Joseph Sullivan, an attorney for Mr. Milatz, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.",
      "On the day of Mr. Rosa\u2019s death, the two men were upgrading the elevator at East Clarke Place in the Mount Eden section of the Bronx by replacing the steel ropes that connected the elevator car with the counterweight, prosecutors said. Mr. Rosa was working in the pit at the bottom of the elevator shaft, and Mr. Milatz, a senior mechanic, was working on the sixth floor, where the elevator car was located.",
      "The car fell down the shaft and killed Mr. Rosa after he secured the counterweight and used a saw to cut through the steel rope, at Mr. Milatz\u2019s direction. That is a standard procedure that should not have resulted in anyone\u2019s death, prosecutors said.",
      "But an investigation conducted by the New York City Department of Investigation found that Mr. Milatz failed to follow safety procedures during the operation as well as in the weeks leading up to it. Taken together, those failures set the stage for routine maintenance to end in death.",
      "\u201cA worker was fatally crushed by a free-falling elevator because his supervisor, an experienced mechanic, failed to follow the most basic safety protocols,\u201d said Jocelyn Stauber, the Department of Investigation commissioner, in a statement. \u201cThis senseless tragedy was entirely preventable.\u201d",
      "Investigators accused Mr. Milatz of not complying with a standard procedure that required him to suspend chains in the elevator shaft and engage the elevator\u2019s brake before the steel rope was cut, a procedure referred to as \u201changing\u201d the car.",
      "Investigators said they also found that Mr. Milatz removed a major safety feature from the elevator two weeks before the operation that killed Mr. Rosa and failed to replace it. That feature, called a governor, triggers the brake system on an elevator car in the event of an emergency.",
      "Mr. Milatz didn\u2019t replace it because the part he brought with him two weeks before Mr. Rosa\u2019s death did not fit, prosecutors said. He left the elevator to function without that important safety feature for two weeks before Mr. Rosa\u2019s death.",
      " published in 2013 by the Center to Protect Workers\u2019 Rights, now called the Center for Construction Research and Training, roughly 30 people in the United States are killed by elevators and escalators each year.",
      "The study said that an estimated 17,000 more people were seriously injured by both, although elevators were responsible for 90 percent of the deaths and 60 percent of the serious injuries. Most people killed by elevators were working inside elevator shafts on installation or maintenance projects, it said."

      "John Wenzel, a veteran, automotive executive, father and grandfather, had recently moved into a senior living apartment in Brooklyn Heights, the Watermark on Clark Street, a new, frills-and-all building with a Manhattan skyline view. He would soon turn 99 and become the oldest resident there. Since his wife, Alice, died more than 10 years earlier, he had settled into a quiet rhythm, alone with his jazz records and his painting.",
      "And suddenly, out of nowhere, these nightmares. He feared he had suffered a seizure, but his vital signs were normal. His adult daughters, Emily and Abby, were also worried. Their father had always been so steady and predictable and was never prone to this sort of profound disquiet.",
      "Looking for its source would send Mr. Wenzel and his daughters on a journey back more than 70 years, to a time and a place he had worked purposely his entire adult life to leave behind, to World War II and the skies above Italy.",
      "Emily and Abby were young girls when they learned their father had fought in the war. They remember a day the family visited their grandmother\u2019s house and she proudly pulled four slender boxes from a drawer. Inside were several medals on bright ribbons.",
      "\u201cShe wanted us to take them home,\u201d Abby Wenzel, now 63, recently recalled. The girls were intensely curious \u2014 the medals were so beautiful \u2014 but their father\u2019s response was immediate: \u201cHe said, \u2018I got those in the war, and I don\u2019t want them.\u2019\u201d",
      "And so the medals stayed out of sight, where he preferred them, for decades.",
      "There are fewer and fewer soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen who lived through World War II. Close to 16 million Americans served in the war; ",
      ". Like Mr. Wenzel, many of these veterans put the war behind them. Much has been written about \u201cthe Greatest Generation\u201d and its valor abroad, as well as its humility back home. This narrative masked the individuals and the personal tolls they would pay.",
      "Over the years, the girls came to understand that their father had been a fighter pilot and that he had been wounded \u2014 in his rear end. This never failed to make them laugh. Did he need special pants? A special chair? And he would grin and endure their gentle teasing. He was a warm and funny man, but that grin was about all anyone got out of him on that subject.",
      "The family lived in Sea Cliff, on Long Island. Mr. Wenzel had worked at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City before joining Ideal Corporation, which manufactured stainless steel hose clamps for automobiles and aircraft in East New York. He worked his way up and eventually became president of the company.",
      "He retired and played a lot of golf until his aging body caught up with him. Finally, in 2023, living in Brooklyn and stooped and slowed by a broken hip, his 100th birthday approaching, he was suddenly overwhelmed by the stress he survived as a younger man.",
      "The nightmares sent his daughters back to those little rectangular boxes they had first seen at their grandmother\u2019s. They brought them to their father, along with some typed notes he\u2019d written at some point, as he began to finally speak about his time in the war.",
      "The writings begin abruptly. On Dec. 7, 1941, breaking news interrupted a game of bridge at Lafayette College, a liberal arts school in Pennsylvania. \u201cTrain came down from N.Y. with many guys like me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI joined them.\u201d",
      "The attack on Pearl Harbor pulled the United States and millions of its young men into uniform. John Wenzel was 19 when he enlisted and was dispatched to flight school in Miami. He had never even been on an airplane, but he emerged in 1944 as a fighter pilot and was sent off to the Italian front to fight the Nazis. He would fly the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bomber, the lone occupant of an eight-ton weapon when fully loaded.",
      "\u201cI never got good at marching or saluting,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut they made me a pretty good pilot.\u201d",
      "Lieutenant Wenzel flew scattered missions in Northern Italy, near Milan, and just over the Austrian border in early 1945. His bombs destroyed Axis railroad cars and a large gasoline truck outside a depot in Trento. In February, he bombed and strafed more than a dozen enemy cars with machine guns in Lienz, Austria. He severed a rail line and fired rockets at stalled enemy train cars in Novara in March.",
      "But it was all just a lead-up to April 1945.",
      "Fighting was furious then on the Italian ground, with the Allies depending on the roaring Thunderbolts overhead near Verona and along the Po River south of Milan.",
      "Lieutenant Wenzel was flying several attack missions every week, guiding his team through bad weather and, in Air Force parlance, \u201cpersistent and accurate antiaircraft fire.\u201d \u201cThe irony,\u201d he wrote later in his notes, \u201cis that we were working harder than ever, flying some of our best missions, but for the first time we talked openly about survival.\u201d",
      "He eluded enemy fire for the first 13 days of April.",
      "On April 14, Lieutenant Wenzel led a team of four fighter planes, providing air support for units pushing toward a rail hub in the town of Zocca. Lieutenant Wenzel scored a direct hit with his bombs, destroying enemy guns.",
      "Then a German shell burst right outside his cockpit. Fragments sliced into his plane, tearing his uniform. Bleeding from his neck, he circled around for another attack before guiding his heavily damaged aircraft back to the base.",
      "His actions that day would earn him a Purple Heart, but first, Lieutenant Wenzel returned to the air.",
      "\u201cGerman troops were on both sides of the river and were beating our guys up with all kinds of guns,\u201d Lieutenant Wenzel wrote later. His team flew toward a farmhouse that held a machine-gun nest.",
      "\u201cOn our first pass, there were plenty of tracers coming at us, and I got hit from underneath,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt felt like somebody had paddled my rear end.\u201d",
      "He asked another pilot to fly under his plane to eyeball the damage. Looks OK, the pilot reported, even as smoke started to fill Lieutenant Wenzel\u2019s cockpit and his parachute seemed to be on fire. He radioed his fellow pilots to coordinate another pass on the farmhouse.",
      "An officer got on the radio: \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be a jerk, John. Go home.\u2019\u201d The officer, Joseph Dickerson, was a captain and outranked the lieutenant. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have a military discipline handbook with me,\u201d Mr. Wenzel wrote. \u201cWe told him we were having too much fun to go home.\u201d",
      "The team attacked their target again until, satisfied, they turned toward Pisa and their air base. But Lieutenant Wenzel\u2019s troubles were mounting.",
      "\u201cI began to think that old Joe was right,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fire had consumed most of my chute, plus the seat of my pants, and was starting on my seatbelt, which burned like the wick to a cheap firecracker.\u201d",
      "He couldn\u2019t eject without a parachute, and opening the cockpit would feed the flames with oxygen. His only option was to push on to Pisa.",
      "He finally landed, and a crew hurried to extinguish the flames. A doctor \u201cpulled a few steel splinters out of me\u201d and treated him with burn ointment. He wisecracked: \u201cMy request for a replacement pair of trousers was denied.\u201d",
      "Earning a Purple Heart is usually a source of great pride, a testament to surviving an injury in combat. Earning two Purple Hearts in eight days would seem to place a man in the company of the very, very lucky.",
      "Lieutenant Wenzel shipped back home in late 1945. He graduated from Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, and ended up in New York City. He found an apartment on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village. But for a buddy or two from the service, he was alone.",
      "He liked to paint in a studio he rented for $20 a month on the Lower East Side. After a day of painting, he would walk toward home, but not quite get there. The first stop instead was the San Remo Cafe, also on Macdougal.",
      "The place, like the surrounding city, would have been thick with unmoored young veterans like himself, and Mr. Wenzel found comfort in their company \u2014 \u201cpeople like me,\u201d he\u2019d say later \u2014 without exactly interacting with them. He drank a lot, and he kept to himself.",
      "He would go on to call this \u201cthe dark times,\u201d and once told a grandnephew that he was \u201ca mess\u201d then.",
      "Eventually, he discovered his instinct for business. He met a young social worker, Alice Newman, and they married and started a family. He stayed busy, and the war faded into the background.",
      "And, for more than 70 years, that was where the war stayed. The nightmares arrived when he moved into his Brooklyn apartment \u2014 so vivid he believed they were real and scolded his home nurse for not saving him. Doctors could find no physical cause for the panic. A sleep specialist suggested he speak to a therapist.",
      "His daughters set him up with a counselor over Zoom, who suggested he consider opening up more about his past. And the stories slowly revealed themselves. The Wenzel daughters found their father, far out of character, eager to share.",
      "In early March, shortly before his 100th birthday, Mr. Wenzel agreed to an interview, conducted in his living room. Beside him were his medals, the first time he\u2019d seen them in decades \u2014 a Distinguished Flying Cross, an Air Medal, a Silver Star, his two Purple Hearts. His vision and hearing diminished, he spoke with effort about staying quiet for so long.",
      "\u201cThere was no place to talk about it, and no way to express myself,\u201d he said. He glanced toward the medals. \u201cFor many years, these were tucked away. We didn\u2019t have much reason to pull them out.\u201d",
      "He said that right after the war, even in a downtown bar filled with other soldiers, it was unbecoming to seem to seek attention. \u201cNobody asked me about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring it up.\u201d",
      "He became aware of reunions of his old fighter squadron. He rarely went. \u201cI didn\u2019t see why I should spend my time \u2026\u201d His voice trailed off.",
      "Years ago, his wife wanted to visit Italy and, in particular, Venice. No, thanks, he said reflexively. Not Venice.",
      "\u201cThere were certain places you weren\u2019t supposed to bomb or shoot up,\u201d he explained recently. \u201cVenice was one of them.\u201d",
      "He recalls flying over the untouchable city. \u201cGerman soldiers had occupied Venice, and were enjoying the sunshine and whatever else they got in Venice,\u201d he recalled. It angered him.",
      "Eventually, he relented and visited the city with Alice. \u201cShe liked Venice,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He chuckled. He said he hoped stories like his would keep the war from being forgotten.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid people are going to take it lightly \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got their own wars, and World War II is getting to be smaller and smaller.\u201d",
      "The bravado he had once shown in his writing \u2014 \u201ctoo much fun to go home\u201d \u2014 long ago fled him. The medals, for years hidden away, have filled that space. \u201cI found I needed to look at them,\u201d Mr. Wenzel said. The nightmares have stopped.",

      "The New York City panel charged with regulating rents across nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments gave preliminary approval on Tuesday to some of the largest increases in years.",
      "The nine-member panel, the Rent Guidelines Board, voted to back increases on one-year leases of between 2 and 5 percent and increases on two-year leases of between 4 and 7 percent.",
      "The final increases, which the board is expected to approve with another vote in the coming weeks, will almost certainly fall between the ranges put forward on Tuesday. It is the second year in a row that the board has endorsed significant hikes, presenting another challenge for people struggling to afford living in the city.",
      "The board\u2019s meeting was disrupted when a group of tenant advocates, including several left-leaning members of the City Council, ran onto a stage where the board was seated and began leading the audience in chants calling for a rent decrease. The group then began marching around the board members.",
      "To determine the level of increase, the board examined factors that affect renters, including employment trends and wages, and ones that affect landlords, including rising fuel and insurance costs. As in past years, the increases track inflation, which has been high during the rebound from the worst of the pandemic.",
      "Any increase would affect leases beginning on or after Oct. 1.",
      "Rent-stabilized apartments make up about 44 percent of all New York City rentals, and are home to roughly two million people.",
      "The median rent in rent-stabilized apartments is $1,400, more than 20 percent lower than that of unregulated apartments, according to a recent city survey, making the homes a crucial source of lower-cost housing in one of the most expensive cities in the nation.",
      "And the median household income of people living in rent-stabilized apartments is around $44,000, more than 33 percent lower than that of tenants in unregulated apartments, ",
      ".",
      "That makes the board\u2019s annual vote a tense flashpoint in the long-running dispute between renters and landlords over the cost of living.",
      "Tenant groups said they were disappointed by the range approved. Leah Goodridge, a former tenant representative on the board and managing attorney for housing policy at the Mobilization for Justice, a nonprofit legal services group, said she appreciated members of the City Council leading a protest at the meeting.",
      "\u201cThis is literally about survival in New York City and a lot of people are angry for good reason,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re being pushed out and it\u2019s important to have leaders that signal \u2018I\u2019m going to fight.\u2019\u201d",
      "Landlord groups said the range approved on Tuesday was not enough to cover their expenses.",
      "\u201cThis preliminary range falls short of the rent adjustments needed to preserve aging stabilized apartment buildings faced with constantly increasing costs,\u201d said Michael Tobman, a spokesman for the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group, in testimony to the board last week.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement that he hoped the board \u201cwill look at options below the top of these preliminary ranges to strike the right balance to keep New Yorkers in their homes while providing building owners with the resources they need to provide safe, high-quality homes.\u201d",
      "The rent-stabilization system was established in 1969. It is designed to insulate renters from sharp increases in rent. (It is ",
      " program.)",
      "The members of the Rent Guidelines Board are all appointed by the mayor and include two representatives for owners, two for tenants and five for the public. The board\u2019s annual votes represent one of the few ways the mayor can directly address the city\u2019s housing costs.",
      "Last year, the board voted 5 to 4 to raise rents on one-year leases by 3.25 percent in rent-stabilized homes and on two-year leases by 5 percent \u2014 the highest increases in almost a decade.",
      "That vote was the first during the tenure of Mr. Adams, who has been more sympathetic to landlords\u2019 worries than his predecessor, Bill de Blasio. ",
      "The vote to determine the final increases is likely to take place in June. For at least the past 20 years, the final figures have matched the outcome of the preliminary vote."

      "The cross-examination was a duel between two New York personalities: a woman who had been a star in the media world, writing an advice column on intimate matters for readers across America, and a lawyer known for aggressive advocacy who is now one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most visible champions and is also representing him in the criminal case brought by the Manhattan district attorney.",
      "Mr. Tacopina, with an expression of incredulity, tested Ms. Carroll on minute details of events of more than 30 years ago. He repeatedly asked her why she decided to come forward with the accusation when she did \u2014 an effort on his part to suggest to the jury ulterior motives: politics, money and fame.",

She spoke of how he had asked her to help him choose a gift for a friend, how he had led her into a dressing room and how he had pushed her up against a wall, pulled down her tights, put his fingers into her vagina and then inserted his penis \u2014 all without her consent and while she tried to escape.",
      "Mr. Tacopina used his cross-examination not only to ask Ms. Carroll about what she said happened, but to question her about what she did afterward. He repeatedly asked her why she hadn\u2019t screamed and why she had called a friend instead of going to the police.",
      "The veteran lawyer, 57, who on the first day of cross-examination wore a tapered navy suit, was an imposing courtroom presence. He rarely let go of the lectern from which he lobbed questions in a deep, booming voice, at times leaning forward, to the side and backward.",
      "Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyers frequently objected, arguing that many questions were argumentative, repetitive and at times misrepresented their client\u2019s testimony. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sustained several of the objections.",
      "The lawyer asked Ms. Carroll again and again whether she had screamed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a screamer,\u201d Ms. Carroll, 79, yelled. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat up on me for not screaming.\u201d",

      "The sudden security demands, which will last well beyond an end to the war in Ukraine, come at a moment when colossal outlays are also needed to care for rapidly aging populations, as well as to avoid potentially disastrous climate change. The European Union\u2019s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral by 2050 alone is estimated to cost between $175 billion and $250 billion each year for the next\u00a027\u00a0years.",

      "It was ",
      " on Monday when federal regulators notified JPMorgan Chase executives that they had beaten out three smaller rivals in their bid to buy the doomed First Republic Bank.",
      "By the time the sun rose, JPMorgan\u2019s longtime chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was once again illuminated as the industry\u2019s savior \u2014 and the architect of yet another government-brokered deal to help his gargantuan institution grow even larger.",
      "First Republic was the third institution that Mr. Dimon had agreed to buy in a federally backed transaction, following its takeovers of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the 2008 financial crisis. All three deals have helped defuse panics, but they have also benefited JPMorgan, which, with $3.7 trillion in assets and 14 percent of all deposits in the United States, enjoys unparalleled reach inside the world\u2019s largest economy.",
      "JPMorgan\u2019s agreement to buy First Republic is expected to boost the bank\u2019s profits by $500 million this year and will give it access to a stable of wealthy clients.",
      "Yet the deal, coming at a time when politicians from both parties have grown increasingly wary of corporate power, is likely to raise more questions about whether banks like JPMorgan have grown so big that they stifle competition and threaten the financial system.",
      "\u201cFirst Republic Bank\u2019s sale to the biggest bank in the country only makes our banking system\u2019s \u2018too big to fail\u2019 problem even worse,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts.",
      "The transaction adds to Mr. Dimon\u2019s legacy; it has become easy to draw comparisons between him and the man for whom his bank is named. Back in 1907, John Pierpont Morgan Sr. ",
      " locked his Wall Street peers inside his study and refused to let them out until they agreed to join him in bailing out the panic-stricken financial system.",
      "Not since then, financial historians said, has the leader of a single company held such sway over the U.S. financial system.",
      "\u201cThere has always been this question of who can convince everybody that they have the assets or the cultural authority to stop a bank run,\u201d said Kenneth W. Mack, a professor of law and history at Harvard University. Given JPMorgan\u2019s reputation for risk aversion and Mr. Dimon\u2019s long history atop the bank, \u201cit\u2019s natural that he\u2019s the person who the federal authorities continue to rely on to come to the rescue.\u201d",
      "Mr. Dimon became chief executive in 2006, less than two years after JPMorgan ",
      " the Chicago bank that he\u2019d been running. After the merger, JPMorgan was big: It had more than $1.1 trillion in assets and held about 10 percent of the country\u2019s deposits. It was on its way to becoming an industry powerhouse.",
      "Mr. Dimon had come of age in the industry as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sanford Weill, the hard-charging chairman of Citigroup, whose mission was to build the world\u2019s greatest financial supermarket. In the late 1990s, it was Mr. Weill\u2019s ravenous appetite for growth that had prompted Washington to tear down walls that, since the Great Depression, had hemmed in the banking industry and barred commercial lenders from peddling a broad range of financial services.",
      "Mr. Dimon had been running JPMorgan for barely two years when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and it provided him with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to recast JPMorgan \u2014 and himself \u2014 as industry heroes.",
      "With the entire global banking on the brink, Mr. Dimon became one of a small handful of top executives, along with the men running Bank of America and Wells Fargo, who tried to fashion themselves as rescuers.",
      "Bank of America gobbled up Merrill Lynch and Countrywide. Wells Fargo got Wachovia. Mr. Dimon\u2019s haul: Bear Stearns, then Washington Mutual. Within a few years, there was a key difference between Mr. Dimon and his rivals: Their institutions ran into trouble \u2014 first Bank of America, then Wells Fargo \u2014 and their leaders stepped aside.",
      "Mr. Dimon is now Wall Street\u2019s longest-serving C.E.O.",
      "JPMorgan kept growing. In recent years, it ",
      " dozens of smaller businesses: a student financial aid firm, ",
      " software companies, even the restaurant review website that owns Zagat.",
      "The swelling size of banks like JPMorgan has troubled some experts, including senior officials in the Biden administration. A small handful of banks have amassed dominant positions in many parts of the country, crowding out community lenders and leaving customers with limited access to banking services.",
      "Yet even when JPMorgan was humbled by occasional scandals \u2014 the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading blowup in 2012, in which the bank lost more than $6 billion, was by far the most serious \u2014 Mr. Dimon often turned the tables. As regulators moved to punish the bank for misconduct by the companies it had purchased during the crisis, Mr. Dimon insisted to federal officials that he\u2019d been doing them and the country a favor by buying the flailing institutions. Industry observers marveled at Mr. Dimon\u2019s steadfast refusal to apologize.",
      "Somewhere along the way, Mr. Dimon began filling in a missing piece of his public profile: the role of a statesman whose power and prestige transcended the single institution.",
      "That was how the world had viewed J.P. Morgan a century earlier. He had been more than the world\u2019s richest man; he was also the banker with the clearest sense that the interests of Wall Street, Washington and himself were closely entwined, according to David K. Thomson, an associate professor of history at Sacred Heart University. Mr. Morgan, therefore, understood that he had a powerful incentive to solve the industry\u2019s crises whenever possible.",
      "Mr. Dimon set out to show the world that he, too, was more than just a savvy and fabulously wealthy banker.",
      "After JPMorgan was caught illegally foreclosing on the homes of active military service members in 2011, Mr. Dimon co-founded an effort by 11 companies to hire more military veterans, pledging to bring on 100,000 by 2020. After the city of Detroit went bankrupt in 2013, in part because of shenanigans by Wall Street banks, JPMorgan pledged to help reverse the city\u2019s fortunes, and Mr. Dimon personally associated himself with the work.",
      "He began opining on a wide range of policy issues, from education to immigration, in a letter he wrote to shareholders each spring. He became chairman of the Business Roundtable and worked to strengthen the group\u2019s sway over lawmakers. He publicly championed the concept of \u201cstakeholder capitalism,\u201d the idea that doing right by shareholders also involved treating communities, workers and customers better.",
      "During the Obama administration, Mr. Dimon was being touted as a possible public servant. The billionaire investor Warren Buffett ",
      " in 2012 that President Barack Obama make Mr. Dimon Treasury secretary. In 2016, following rumors that President-elect Donald J. Trump might tap him for that position, Mr. Dimon ",
      " that he had let Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team know that he wasn\u2019t interested. A columnist for The New York Post ",
      " again in 2020 after President Biden\u2019s election, though Mr. Dimon ",
      " that he\u2019d \u201cnever coveted the job.\u201d",
      "All this talk, though, along with his longevity as a chief executive and JPMorgan\u2019s reputation for stability, rendered Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s ",
      " to Mr. Dimon to help with First Republic unsurprising when it came.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear in 2008 that Jamie Dimon would be that person; it\u2019s what happened since 2008 that\u2019s made him that person,\u201d Mr. Mack said.",
      "Mr. Buffett put it this way in an email to The New York Times on Monday: \u201cJamie is doing the right thing for the country and the right thing for JPMorgan Chase \u2014 exactly what I would have expected him to do.\u201d"

      "A CNBC journalist accused Jeff Shell, the former chief executive of NBCUniversal, of pressuring her for sex over a period of years during her career at the business news network, according to a copy of her complaint reviewed by The New York Times.",
      "The complaint, lodged in late March by Hadley Gamble, an anchor and senior international correspondent, kicked off an investigation that led to Mr. Shell\u2019s dismissal last week, ",
      " across a far-flung media empire that includes NBC News, the Universal movie studio and DreamWorks Animation.",
      "Less than a page of Ms. Gamble\u2019s complaint, which is more than a dozen pages, focused on allegations of sexual harassment by Mr. Shell. Much of the complaint raised accusations of bullying and discrimination at CNBC, saying women at the network\u2019s international division were harassed by their male colleagues on several different occasions.",
      "Comcast, NBCUniversal\u2019s parent company, hired the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to investigate the complaint after it was sent to the company\u2019s executives in New York and London.",
      "Last week, Comcast said that it had found evidence to corroborate allegations of sexual harassment against Mr. Shell and that it had fired him for cause. The company is not paying him severance.",
      "A spokeswoman for Comcast said the company was continuing to investigate Ms. Gamble\u2019s complaint.",
      "Mr. Shell said in a statement that he and Ms. Gamble had a \u201cmutual and consensual relationship\u201d and that \u201cthe complaint wildly misrepresents the facts of what happened.\u201d",
      "Suann MacIsaac, a lawyer for Ms. Gamble, said that Mr. Shell \u201ctargeted\u201d Ms. Gamble months before they met in person and continued his pursuit after his promotion to chief executive.",
      "\u201cWe expect more attempts at revisionist history from a man who was just fired for cause following a decade-long campaign of sexual harassment, which began when he was C.E.O. of NBC Universal International,\u201d Ms. MacIsaac said.",
      "Ms. Gamble, 41, is a journalist based in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. She has interviewed major world figures including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, and she has worked for CNBC for more than a decade in the Middle East and London, where she met Mr. Shell.",
      "The complaint alleged that Mr. Shell invited Ms. Gamble to dinner in London \u2014 the complaint does not say what year \u2014 when she was a relatively junior producer and he was the head of NBC International. After the dinner, Mr. Shell accompanied Ms. Gamble back to her hotel and he pressured her to start a sexual relationship but was rebuffed.",
      "Ms. Gamble did not work for the division Mr. Shell oversaw when they met, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Ms. Gamble and Mr. Shell eventually did begin a sexual relationship, according to the complaint, after it became clear to her that rebutting his advances would probably damage her career. The complaint said that Mr. Shell continued to use his position of power at NBCUniversal to pressure her for sex while pursuing her in London, New York and Dubai.",
      "Mr. Shell pursued Ms. Gamble on and off over a period of years over text and email, according to two people familiar with their correspondence, and Ms. Gamble turned over those messages to the company as part of its investigation.",
      "Elsewhere in the complaint, Ms. Gamble alleged specific instances of discrimination and inappropriate behavior toward numerous women at CNBC. In one instance, Ms. Gamble describes a manager calling her a vulgar epithet for women in front of her co-workers for raising concerns about bullying behavior from another journalist. In another, she alleges a co-worker berated her for ending an interview early, using coarse language, and snapping at her for rewriting headlines that she had to read on air.",
      "Ms. Gamble filed the complaint after CNBC did not renew her contract this year. A person familiar with Ms. Gamble\u2019s thinking said that her decision to file the complaint, which she had considered for years, was also based on frustration with what she viewed as a toxic culture of harassment and bullying at CNBC. Axios ",
      " on those aspects of the complaint.",
      "John Casey, the president of CNBC International, told her in February that the network would not offer her a contract for a period longer than a month, according to the complaint. He told her that she had a behavioral problem and accused her of bullying other journalists at CNBC.",
      "Ms. Gamble denied those accusations, according to her complaint. She said in her complaint that Mr. Casey had used the allegations of bullying to justify the decision not to renew her contract, adding that such claims would not have been leveled against a male peer.",
      "Tension existed between Ms. Gamble and CNBC managers before the network\u2019s decision not to renew her contract. In June, the network told her that it was investigating a complaint made against her and a manager at CNBC who had supervised her.",
      "Among other things, CNBC investigated whether she had used a romantic relationship with Tom Barrack, a private equity investor, to secure an interview with Jared Kushner, according to Ms. Gamble\u2019s complaint. The investigation concluded that Ms. Gamble did have a relationship with Mr. Barrack, but determined the relationship was disclosed and there was no evidence of impropriety, according to her complaint. Mr. Barrack was unmarried at the time of his relationship with Ms. Gamble, according to a person familiar with the relationship.",
      "The investigation into Ms. Gamble also found that she had made inappropriate comments about some colleagues in the past, and that she had not always strictly complied with CNBC\u2019s travel and expense policy."

      "Just hours after the union representing thousands of television and movie writers announced that they were going on strike, hundreds of their members occupied an entire city block in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday.",
      "Gathered outside an NBCUniversal event on Fifth Avenue, the writers chanted \u201cNo contract, no content\u201d and held up signs with slogans like \u201cPencils Down!!!\u201d and \u201cSpoiler Alert: We Will Win.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese companies are absolutely destroying our industry,\u201d Tony Kushner, the acclaimed playwright and a screenwriter of movies like \u201cLincoln\u201d and \u201cThe Fabelmans,\u201d said from the picket line, referring to Hollywood studios.",
      "It was a noisy show of solidarity, echoed on picket lines outside the major studios in Los Angeles. But the immediate fallout of the strike \u2014 which shattered 15 years of labor peace in the entertainment industry and will bring much of Hollywood\u2019s production assembly line to a halt \u2014 was felt most acutely in the world of late-night television, which immediately went dark.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, NBC issued a statement that the upcoming edition of the \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d would be a repeat from April. \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d canceled a show that was supposed to feature an interview with the actress Rachel Weisz, replacing it with a rerun from February.",
      "New episodes from late-night shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel have also been suspended. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d canceled a new episode scheduled for this weekend with Pete Davidson as host. NBC said it would \u201cair repeats until further notice,\u201d raising the possibility that the show will not be able to end its 48th season with a finale.",
      "How long late-night talk shows stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, in 2007, late-night shows gradually came back after about two months, even with their writers still on picket lines. (That strike lasted 100 days.)",
      "Mr. Kimmel, ABC\u2019s late-night host, was paying his staff out of pocket during that strike, and he said years later that he had to return to air because he had nearly drained ",
      ".",
      "David Letterman, who owned his CBS late-night show through his production company Worldwide Pants, made a deal with the Writers Guild of America that allowed his writers to come back on the show.",
      "The other hosts \u2014 whose shows were owned by media companies \u2014 had no such luck. Hosts like Mr. Kimmel and Conan O\u2019Brien returned without their writers, and gamely tried to put together their shows without their standard monologues. Mr. O\u2019Brien had to resort to time-killing gimmicks, such as spinning his wedding ring on his desk, ",
      "Jay Leno, the host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d infuriated W.G.A. officials by writing his own monologue jokes. \u201cA Jew, a Christian and a Muslim walk into a bar,\u201d Mr. Leno said during his opening monologue, which stretched nearly 10 minutes. \u201cThe Jew says to the Muslim, see, I have no idea what they say, because there\u2019s a writers\u2019 strike.\u201d",
      "Late-night hosts and their top producers have been on group calls in recent weeks, coordinating a response in the event of a strike, according to a person briefed on the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.",
      "Unlike the enmity of the so-called late-night wars from the 1990s, the hosts have made a concerted effort to show that they are on friendly, if still competitive, terms. When James Corden signed off from \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d last week, there was ",
      " that featured Mr. Colbert, Mr. Fallon, Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Meyers all together.",
      "Mr. Meyers, the host of NBC\u2019s 12:30 a.m. show, alluded to the devastation of the last strike in a segment late last week.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just affect the writers,\u201d Mr. Meyers said ",
      ". \u201cIt affects all the incredible nonwriting staff on these shows.\u201d",
      "He added that he was a proud member of the W.G.A., and that he felt strongly that what the writers were asking for was \u201cnot unreasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t see me here next week, know that it is something that is not done lightly, and that I will be heartbroken to miss you as well,\u201d he said.",
      "The strike would have to stretch for a significantly longer time before viewers began to see the effects on scripted TV shows and movies, because the production process for them can take months or more than a year. But the mere fact that many productions suddenly stopped was a blow to an industry already rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.",
      "The biggest issue for the writers is pay. They have said that their compensation has stagnated even as television production has rapidly grown over the past decade. The unions representing the writers, the East and West branches of the Writers Guild of America, said \u201cthe companies\u2019 behavior has created a gig economy inside a union work force, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing.\u201d",
      "W.G.A. leaders have called this moment \u201cexistential,\u201d arguing that the \u201cthe survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation.\u201d",
      "The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said in a statement shortly before the strike was announced that its offer included \u201cgenerous increases in compensation for writers.\u201d",
      "The primary sticking points, according to the studios, involve union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time \u201cwhether needed or not.\u201d",
      "Chris Keyser, a chair of the W.G.A. negotiating committee, said in an interview early Tuesday morning that \u201cphilosophically, and practically, we\u2019re very far apart.\u201d",
      "Over the last decade, a period that is often referred to as Peak TV, the number of scripted television shows broadcast in the United States has risen sharply. Writers, however, said that their pay has stagnated.",
      "In the network television era, a writer could get work on a show with more than 20 episodes a season, providing a steady living for an entire year. However, in the streaming era, episode orders have declined to 8 or 12, and the median weekly pay for a writer-producer has gone down slightly, the W.G.A. said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re making it impossible for younger writers to make a living,\u201d Mr. Kushner, the playwright and screenwriter, said. \u201cOur wages have declined since the last strike.\u201d",
      "The writers want to also fix the formula for residual payments, which have been upended by streaming. Years ago, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed \u2014 into syndication or through DVD sales. But global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have cut off those distribution arms and pay a fixed residual instead.",
      "For now, the writers\u2019 creative energy will be solely dedicated to their picket signs. Outside the NBCUniversal event, one writer held up a sign that read, \u201cPay your writers or we\u2019ll spoil \u2018Succession.\u2019\u201d",

      "This time last year, Shanghai \u2014 China\u2019s capital of fashion and luxury \u2014 was in the throes of a ruthlessly enforced Covid lockdown. The city\u2019s glittering high-end malls and avenues lined with flagship stores ",
      ".",
      "Today it is a different story. Huge crowds on a recent weekend flocked to top retail destinations on or near Nanjing Road, the hub of glamour in China ever since the country\u2019s first large department stores began to open there in 1917.",
      "\u201cI splurge more extravagantly,\u201d Sunny Zhang, 24, said as she waited in line to enter the Chanel store at Plaza 66 mall, where the corridors are lined with shops selling some of the world\u2019s most expensive apparel. Ms. Zhang, who works for a consulting firm, used to buy six handbags a year. Now, she purchases up to five handbags a month.",
      "\u201cI change my handbag every day,\u201d Ms Zhang added. \u201cI felt that everything was meaningless during the Shanghai lockdown, so we should enjoy the present moment in time.\u201d",
      "Many Western fashion and luxury brands have been reaping the benefits of this renewed consumer mind-set. Last month, LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury goods group by sales, and the owner of brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Company and Dior, posted a 17 percent increase in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier. Fashion and leather goods \u2014 the French company\u2019s biggest division \u2014 were up 18 percent, driven in large part by the rebound in China.",
      "Last week, LVMH shares soared to a record high, making it the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value. Its French rival Herm\u00e8s said sales in Asia (excluding Japan) were up 23 percent in the first quarter, \u201cdriven by a very good Chinese New Year.\u201d",
      "And Brunello Cucinelli, purveyor of $4,000 blazers and the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d trend, posted a 56 percent surge in first-quarter sales. Luca Lisandroni, the Italian brand\u2019s co-chief executive, called 2023 \u201ca golden year\u201d for the China market.",
      "Luxury spending in China is bouncing back even faster than the country\u2019s overall economy. Retail sales of jewelry, gold and silver soared 37.4 percent in March from a year earlier, more than three times as fast as the rebound in overall retail sales, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics. It was by far the biggest March on record for jewelry sales in China; indeed, March was the industry\u2019s second-highest sales month ever outside the gift-giving season before Chinese New Year.",
      "\u201cWe expect China to be the luxury industry\u2019s key growth engine this year, especially given a slight deceleration in other core markets like the U.S. and Korea,\u201d Edouard Aubin, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said on a call last week.",
      "He added that big brands \u201cat the top of the pricing pyramid\u201d with status-symbol value like Chanel, Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton were outperforming rivals. Those include Gucci and Burberry, both brands that have recently had a change of designer at their helm.",
      "\u201cMuch of the initial spend driving the rebound is, for now, less to do with the middle class of China and more to do with rich people spending more,\u201d Mr. Aubin said, noting that he expected ",
      " to kick in later this year.",
      "This desire for big-name luxury in China isn\u2019t new. For more than a decade, the country, with 1.4 billion consumers, powered the Western luxury market, contributing as much as a third of market revenue. Two-thirds of that spending took place outside mainland China, as Chinese tourists flocked to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris and elsewhere to avoid their country\u2019s steep import tariffs and consumption taxes.",
      "But then came 2020, the worst year on record for the industry, as China closed its borders in response to the pandemic. Now, after three years of relying largely on online purchases, many shoppers in China exult in being able to touch fabrics, try on handbags and sunglasses and simply share companionship with others.",
      "In the Zhang Yuan neighborhood, where heavily restored buildings have polished wood frames and elegant stone columns, a crowd gathered and waited outside the Dior store to watch for celebrities. The onlookers did not have to wait long: Annie Yi, the famous Taiwanese singer, walked out of the store accompanied by a young woman who carried a white Dior bag big enough to hold a flat-panel television.",
      "Zoe Zhou, who was at the Dior store looking for a handbag owned by a member of the K-pop band Blackpink, said she had seen a frenzy to buy luxury goods in her home city, Nanjing, with people lining up outside of stores at downtown malls.",
      "\u201cNow that restrictions have been lifted, there are a lot of people buying handbags,\u201d said Ms. Zhou, who was disappointed that the bag she wanted was sold out. \u201cYou can also go abroad. The price difference between domestic and foreign countries is quite large.\u201d",
      "Many luxury brands have raised prices in recent months, notably in China. But traveling outside China remains far more difficult than it was before the pandemic.",
      "Airfares are higher, with a significantly reduced overseas flight schedule. As part of a national security campaign, the Chinese government has made it harder to obtain or renew passports.",
      "As domestic destinations like the duty-free tropical island of Hainan continue to gain popularity, and retail hot spots like Chengdu and Hangzhou continue to emerge, the pivot by Chinese shoppers to buying more domestically is expected to continue. Social media posts about stock shortages and long lines have also become common.",
      "\u201cThe domestic recovery may be well underway, but international travel is still far from pre-Covid levels, nor do we think Chinese tourists will be returning at the volumes they once did to Europe any time soon,\u201d said Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods research at Citi. Short-haul destinations like Hong Kong, Macau and possibly Japan, given the weak Japanese yen, may see the return of Chinese spending sooner, he added.",
      "Not everyone has been coming out on top. Muted quarterly results last week from Kering, the home of Gucci and Balenciaga, reminded investors that a rising tide in China won\u2019t necessarily lift all brands. The Paris-based group\u2019s revenue ",
      " in the first three months of 2023, hampered by a slowdown in its U.S. and wholesale business, the dwindling popularity of Gucci and continuing fallout from a ",
      " published by Balenciaga at the end of last year.",
      "According to Antoine Belge, an analyst at BNP Paribas Exane, \u201cStrong brands with serious brand desirability are getting stronger.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing bigger helps,\u201d he added.",
      "The same goes for luxury markets. Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a senior partner at the consultancy Bain, estimated that the population of middle- and high-income consumers in mainland China will double to 500 million by 2030. By then, she predicted, the country will account for around 40 percent of global luxury purchases.",
      "\u201cWhile African and Southeast Asian countries might be emerging luxury markets,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Arpizio said, \u201cthe sheer size of the China luxury market makes it unique and of great strategic importance.\u201d",

      "The pandemic had a bright silver lining for Elkhart, Ind.",
      "The city, renowned as the capital of recreational vehicle production, had a surge in demand as cooped-up families took to the highways and avoided hotels. The cluster of manufacturers enjoyed record profits, and workers benefited as well: The ",
      " sank to 1 percent in late 2021, and average weekly wages ",
      " from their level in early 2020.",
      "That frenzy, however, has turned to a chill. Dealers, who stocked up on as many trailers and vans as they could, have been discounting them to clear their lots \u2014 and new orders have dried up. The area has lost nearly 7,000 manufacturing jobs over the past year, and unemployment is now above the national average. Thor Industries, which owns a wide portfolio of RV brands, ",
      " from the quarter a year ago.",
      "\u201cIn 2022, manufacturers overproduced, and you\u2019re seeing some of the impact of that from the staffing standpoint,\u201d said Chris Stager, chief executive of the Economic Development Corporation of Elkhart County. He foresees new projects propelled by recent federal energy and infrastructure legislation, but rising interest rates are taking a toll in the meantime.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s not what it was,\u201d Mr. Stager said.",
      "That\u2019s manufacturing in America in 2023.",
      "Factory construction is ",
      " than at any time in recent memory, heralding what may be a resurgence in domestic production powered by a move away from long, fragile supply chains and by the infusion of billions of dollars in public investment.",
      "At the same time, after an extraordinary boom fed by cooped-up consumers, manufacturing is suffering something of a hangover as retailers burn through bloated inventories. Inflation-fighting efforts by the Federal Reserve, which is ",
      " on Wednesday, have squelched big-ticket purchases. New orders have been ",
      " and a widely followed index of purchasing activity has been downbeat ",
      ".",
      "Manufacturing employment bounced back quickly after the pandemic \u2014 which is unusual for recessions \u2014 but has ",
      " for two months. While layoffs in the industry remain low, job openings and hires ",
      ".",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not one of these really concerning plunges, where we\u2019re shedding a bunch of manufacturing jobs, but it seems kind of stalled,\u201d said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \u201cAnd I think the longer that lasts, the harder it\u2019s going to be to rev things up.\u201d",
      "A bigger question for the American economy is whether this heralds a broader downturn, since cooling demand for goods usually signifies that consumers are feeling financially strained. \u201cManufacturing is always at the forefront of the recession,\u201d notes Barbara Denham, a senior economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "To understand the current slump, it\u2019s important to dissect the manufacturing moment from which America is emerging.",
      "For example: Those new manufacturing jobs weren\u2019t all for people making steel coils and oak cabinets. The production of consumable items \u2014 including food, beverages, and pharmaceuticals \u2014 represented an outsize portion of the job growth from 2020 through 2022. But it tends to pay less well, requires less training and has fewer unions than heavy manufacturing in airplanes and automobiles. And it can disappear more quickly as demand returns to normal.",
      "The pandemic-era manufacturing boom also didn\u2019t happen equally in all places. States like ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      " surged far above their prepandemic baselines, while longtime manufacturing centers \u2014 ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      " \u2014 have not fully bounced back. That imbalance reflects recent migration trends, as people have moved out of urban areas for more space, more sunshine and a lower cost of living.",
      "The factory construction underway is poised to further reshape the geography of American manufacturing, with the largest increases in investment ",
      ".",
      "All that new building is propelled by several factors. Former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s trade war raised the cost of importing from China and other countries, while the pandemic snarled ports and idled suppliers, hurting manufacturers who depended on far-flung sourcing networks.",
      "In recent months, the war in Ukraine \u2014 for which the United States has furnished more than ",
      " \u2014 has generated more long-term contracts for defense manufacturers, mostly restricted to domestic production.",
      "Steve Macias, a co-owner of a small machine shop in Phoenix, said orders from the semiconductor industry have slowed as the demand for home electronics crested. But in the past few weeks, he has been busy serving military clients \u2014 because the Defense Department has been getting planes and ships back into fighting shape, as well as refilling ",
      ".",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of deferred maintenance,\u201d Mr. Macias said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got two things going on \u2014 this kind of catch-up, and this war that broke out that nobody was really anticipating.\u201d",
      "Finally, over the last two years the passage of three major bills \u2014 the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act \u2014 made available hundreds of billions of dollars for the production of items like semiconductors, solar panels, wind turbines and bridge spans. Private funders have rushed to capitalize on the opportunity, even if much of it is still in the planning stages.",
      "\u201cA lot of manufacturers are reacting to what they see as a lot of long-term structural factors in their industry,\u201d said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at the Economic Innovation Group, an entrepreneurship-focused think tank. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing more demand for domestic production long term. That\u2019s a bet on the future. It\u2019s going to take a while to really translate to employment.\u201d",
      "Even when it does, however, that investment might not yield as many jobs as factories with similar levels of output did in the past.",
      "Freshly built production lines tend to be more automated and more efficient than those designed in the 1950s and \u201960s \u2014 which they need to be, to compete with the lower cost of labor overseas. And some companies are adding robots to their plants, given the difficulty of attracting and retaining enough skilled workers to replace those retiring. The ",
      " of workers in manufacturing is two years older than the national median.",
      "\u201cThese facilities are desperate to try to get the work force,\u201d said Mark Farris, chief executive of the Greenville Area Development Corporation in Greenville, S.C. \u201cAnd instead, I think they\u2019re convincing the officers of the company, \u2018Let\u2019s think about robotics, let\u2019s think about 3-D printing, the technology investment that would take the place of those workers we cannot find.\u2019\u201d",
      "For businesses that depend on industries related to fossil fuels, the ramp-up in federal investment may just be enough to keep them afloat even as demand shifts to clean energy.",
      "LaDon Byars runs Colonial Diversified Polymer Products, which employs about 75 people in western Tennessee. The company has survived many cycles of outsourcing and offshoring, making molded rubber products like gaskets and mats for a variety of customers. Automobile manufacturers are important clients, and Ms. Byars knows that demand for parts that go into cars with internal combustion engines will start to wane.",
      "She has been encouraged, however, by the number of solicitations she has received as a result of rules that require federally funded projects to find their parts and raw materials in the United States, rather than overseas. It may be difficult and impede progress at first, but she thinks reinforcing domestic supply chains will work out better in the end, just like building new roads.",
      "\u201cIt takes a while before they get that intersection through \u2014 it\u2019s a mess and traffic is backed up,\u201d Ms. Byars said. \u201cAnd then when they finally open it up, everything works so much smoother and better, and you don\u2019t have the long delays. We might not even see the impact of not being dependent on other countries, and not having the supply chain disruptions, but I do think that\u2019s what the long-term best interest for the American people is.\u201d"

      "A text message sent by Tucker Carlson that set off a panic at the highest levels of Fox on the eve of its billion-dollar defamation trial showed its most popular host sharing his private, inflammatory views about violence and race.",
      "The discovery of the message contributed to a chain of events that ultimately led to Mr. Carlson\u2019s firing.",
      "In the message, sent to one of his producers in the hours after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Mr. Carlson described how he had recently watched a video of a group of men \u2014 Trump supporters, he said \u2014 violently attacking \u201can Antifa kid.\u201d",
      "It was \u201cthree against one, at least,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And then he expressed a sense of dismay that the attackers, like him, were white.",
      "\u201cJumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not how white men fight,\u201d he said. But he said he found himself for a moment wanting the group to kill the person he had described as the Antifa kid.",
      "For years, Mr. Carlson espoused views on his show that ",
      ". But the text message revealed more about his views on racial superiority. ",
      "The text alarmed the Fox board, which saw the message a day before Fox was set to defend itself against Dominion Voting Systems before a jury. The board grew concerned that the message could become public at trial when Mr. Carlson was on the stand, creating a sensational and damaging moment that would raise broader questions about the company.",
      "The day after the discovery, the board told Fox executives it was bringing in an outside law firm to conduct an investigation into Mr. Carlson\u2019s conduct.",
      "The text message added to a growing number of internal issues involving Mr. Carlson that led the company\u2019s leadership to conclude he was more of a problem than an asset and had to go, according to several people with knowledge of the decision. In other messages he had referred to women \u2014 including a senior Fox executive \u2014 in crude and misogynistic terms. The message about the fight also played a role in the company\u2019s decision to settle with Dominion for $787.5 million, the highest known payout in a defamation case.",
      "A representative for Mr. Carlson said he had no comment.",
      "The text is part of redacted court filings and its contents were previously unreported. The contents of the text were disclosed in interviews with several people close to the defamation lawsuit against Fox. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a message that is protected by a court order. In public filings, it remains hidden behind a block of black text.",
      "Mr. Carlson\u2019s messages were collected as part of the defamation lawsuit filed against Fox by Dominion, which accused the network of knowingly airing falsehoods about election fraud. Many of the messages shared in the case, including those among Fox executives and hosts, were released publicly. But others, like the one between Mr. Carlson and one of his producers in the hours after Jan. 6, 2021, remain redacted.",
      "In that text, Mr. Carlson described his own emotions as he watched the video of the violent clash, which he said took place on the streets of Washington. Mr. Carlson did not describe the race of the man being attacked.",
      "\u201cI found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they\u2019d hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThen somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off: this isn\u2019t good for me. I\u2019m becoming something I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d",
      "After all, he wrote, \u201cSomebody probably loves this kid, and would be crushed if he was killed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t care about those things, if I reduce people to their politics, how am I better than he is?\u201d he wrote.",
      "The text message came to the attention of Fox\u2019s board of directors and even some senior executives only last month, on the Sunday before the trial was set to begin, according to two people with knowledge of Fox\u2019s internal deliberations. At the time, Fox\u2019s negotiators were entering discussions about an out-of-court settlement ahead of the swearing in of what was shaping up to be a diverse jury.",
      "The next day, the board told Fox\u2019s leadership about its plan to have the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz investigate Mr. Carlson. That disclosure set up the possibility that there could be a continuing investigation into what was behind Mr. Carlson\u2019s messages at the same time as a trial, and as he was serving as its top host in prime time.",
      "Fox has not commented about Mr. Carlson\u2019s ouster last week beyond an initial statement announcing that they \u201cagreed to part ways\u201d and thanking \u201chim for his service.\u201d It did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday on the contents of Mr. Carlson\u2019s redacted message.",
      "It remains unclear how the text escaped more notice earlier, given that the Fox legal team was aware of it and other offensive texts written by Mr. Carlson. Fox\u2019s lawyers had produced the text as part of the discovery process and were involved in the redactions. Mr. Carlson had even been asked about it during a deposition, according to several people who have read the unredacted transcripts of his deposition. ",
      "It was not guaranteed that the text would have been revealed in open court. Dominion\u2019s lawyers had still not decided whether they would introduce the text in front of the jury, according to people with knowledge of their plans. The two sides disagreed on whether the Dominion lawyers could have presented such a redacted message at trial if they had decided to do so, a decision that would have ultimately fallen to the judge. The difference became moot after Fox struck an 11th-hour deal on April 18 to pay Dominion $787.5 million and avoid trial.",
      "How Fox\u2019s executives and board handled the case in the months before the trial was scheduled to begin is expected to be at issue in shareholder lawsuits filed against the company in Delaware.",
      "Though Mr. Carlson\u2019s show, \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d was only a small factor in the Dominion suit, his personal texts were drawing outsize scrutiny. ",
      "The text about the fight came on top of a damaging chain of messages that had been revealed publicly ahead of trial, and that were shocking in their own right. Writing to one of his producers after the assault on the Capitol, Mr. Carlson describes the president he championed on his show as a \u201cdemonic force\u201d and a \u201cdestroyer.\u201d",
      "A recurring theme of his show during the six years that it ran in prime time on Fox News was the displacement of white Americans by people of color. Mr. Carlson often framed topics in the news as part of a larger struggle between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d with immigrants and other marginalized groups steadily and surely taking from whites what had long been theirs: political and cultural power in the United States.",
      "He attacked Black social justice activists and portrayed immigrants from Central America as a blight on the nation. He said in 2018 that immigrants make the country \u201cdirtier.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath of a mass shooting in El Paso at the hands of a gunman who cited white supremacist beliefs in his manifesto, Mr. Carlson declared on his show that white supremacy was \u201cnot a real problem,\u201d likening it to a conspiracy theory.",
      "On Monday, The New York Times and other news organizations urged the judge overseeing the Dominion case to release some of the messages that were redacted."

The E.R.A. resolution received 51 (bipartisan) votes but fell short of the 60 votes necessary to advance under the Senate\u2019s current rules.",
      "The fight for the E.R.A. remains critical \u2014 with Roe v. Wade now toppled, it is in fact more critical than ever. Despite what a ",
      " of Americans think, our Constitution has no explicit guarantee of equal rights for women and men \u2014 the only right that cannot be denied or abridged \u201con account of sex\u201d is the right to vote. In the hands of the current Supreme Court, the existing Constitution\u2019s equality guarantees do far too little to protect women.",
      "The E.R.A. would protect the fundamental rights necessary for women to live as equal citizens in America. Properly applied, it would guard against pregnancy and motherhood discrimination; it would also protect women\u2019s control over their reproductive lives. It would authorize laws remedying gender violence, like domestic violence and sexual assault. It might even require government to reduce the gender pay gap.",
      "The fight for the E.R.A. also has broader significance for American politics: It should serve as a reminder that constitutional amendment is",
      "possible \u2014 and necessary, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2014 and that it is one area in which Congress, not courts, gets the final say.",
      "Our Constitution is one of the ",
      " in the world to amend. The last truly significant amendment \u2014 the 26th, which lowered the voting age to 18 \u2014 belonged to another era, in 1971, when Richard Nixon was president. But the remoteness of the possibility of formal constitutional change today may be as much a product of constitutional culture as constitutional structure: Several generations of Americans have lost the habit and muscle memory of seeking formal constitutional change, and the push to get Congress to declare the E.R.A. part of the Constitution could lead the way out of ",
      ".",
      "The E.R.A. was first introduced in 1923, and in 1972 Congress adopted it by well over the constitutionally required two-thirds supermajorities. It looked to be sailing to ratification, for which the Constitution requires approval by three-quarters of the states. But progress ground to a halt in the late 1970s, just three states short, after a conservative movement led by Phyllis Schlafly ignited fear of an America without patriarchy.",
      "Congress has taken renewed interest in the E.R.A., especially since the Supreme Court ended women\u2019s constitutional right to abortion in Dobbs \u2014 though it wasn\u2019t Dobbs alone. Donald Trump\u2019s misogyny ",

      "But there\u2019s a catch. When Congress ",
      ", it included a ratification deadline, providing that the amendment would be part of the Constitution \u201cwhen ratified within seven years\u201d \u2014 that is, 1979. Congress later extended the time frame, but only until 1982 \u2014 and some states also voted to rescind their ratifications. So skeptics raise a serious question: How can the recent ratifications be valid when they came decades after even the second deadline? And do the rescissions deprive the E.R.A. of the constitutionally required 38 states?",
      "The debate today is over who decides how to treat both deadlines and rescissions. The Constitution\u2019s provisions on amendment are silent on these questions. What ",
      " ",
      " say is that Congress is in charge of proposing amendments that it deems necessary. It also empowers Congress to choose the \u201cmode of ratification,\u201d a power that is understood, even by the Supreme Court, to include control over time frames. If the deadline power belongs to Congress, shouldn\u2019t the power to change any deadlines it imposes \u2014 as well as the power to refuse to recognize rescissions \u2014 also lie with Congress?",
      "That\u2019s the position taken by the bipartisan ",
      " that fell short in the Senate last week: It would remove the E.R.A. deadline and recognize it as ratified, period.",
      "The amendment process was designed to give the people\u2019s representatives in Congress the lead role in shaping constitutional meaning, especially at times when the unelected Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations of the Constitution neglect the needs and desires of the American people.",

But many senators \u2014 many people, period \u2014 now point to the rising threats to women\u2019s lives and health after the Dobbs decision greenlighted near-total abortion bans. This reality suggests that the existing Constitution inadequately protects women\u2019s fundamental rights.",
      "Indeed, in all three states that recently ratified the E.R.A., ratification debates emphasized the continuing need for law and public policy to address remaining manifestations of gender inequality \u2014 even before Dobbs. These include pay inequity, often attributable to workplace disadvantages women face because of pregnancy, motherhood and caregiving obligations, and the persistence of sexual assault and harassment.",
      "The Dobbs decision effectively exposes millions of American women to laws that force them to bear children, even those conceived through sexual assault, in states that do nothing to alleviate the burdens, disadvantages and risks stemming from both pregnancy and motherhood. It demonstrates the Supreme Court\u2019s pinched view of the 14th Amendment\u2019s commitments \u2014 essentially freezing the amendment\u2019s meaning at the moment of ratification in 1868, before women could vote.

      "Warren Buffett has long been known as a liberal executive. The Omaha billionaire has contributed millions to pro-choice organizations, he has raised money for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and he ",
      " for higher taxes on the wealthy.",
      "Mr. Buffett\u2019s recent ",
      " to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he has run for 58 years, boasted that Berkshire had paid $32 billion in taxes over the past decade. He said he hoped to pay more in the future: \u201cWe owe the country no less,\u201d wrote Mr. Buffett, a Depression-era baby in his 93rd year.",
      "Yet as the Berkshire faithful gather for their annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday, Mr. Buffett is decidedly out of step with the progressive orthodoxy in corporate boardrooms. To Mr. Buffett, boards\u2019 rightful role is, as ever, to serve the shareholders who have risked their capital. Institutional investors such as BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink have pushed E.S.G. \u2014 or environmental, social and governance \u2014 investing to turn corporations into agents of progressive change.",
      "Scores of corporations have in the last few years adopted climate and diversity policies. The Business Roundtable, a chief executives group, proclaimed it no longer believed that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders. This is a little like the Communist Party dropping its primary allegiance to workers.",
      "Mr. Buffett is having none of it. He is socially conscious and over the years has expressed concerns on topics as varied as inflation and nuclear proliferation. But he is dismissive of social governance warriors seeking to hijack the corporate mission. Most such critics represent ",
      ". Mr. Fink, mutual fund groups like Vanguard and state pension funds manage other people\u2019s money \u2014 they advocate their opinions, not their purses. Mr. Buffett feels a greater allegiance to shareholders who purchased stock as he did \u2014 with their own cash.",
      "Not surprisingly, Mr. Buffett has become a target for progressive institutional investors. At last year\u2019s annual meeting, shareholders solicited proxy votes to force Berkshire to adopt four new policies, mostly on climate and diversity. They lost handily. (A resolution calling for Mr. Buffett to step down as board chairman, though not as C.E.O., fared the worst.) This year, Mr. Buffett faces six proxy challenges related to climate, diversity and corporate governance.",
      "CalPERS, which manages retirement funds in California, demands that Berkshire publish an annual \u201cassessment\u201d on how it manages climate risks. As You Sow, a nonprofit advocacy group, proposes that Berkshire issue a report disclosing how it intends to reduce emissions \u201cassociated\u201d with its big insurance business.",
      "In the proxy solicitation sent to shareholders, As You Sow charges that Berkshire \u201cis not adequately reducing the climate footprint\u201d from insurance. \u201cBerkshire is a laggard,\u201d the group writes, \u201cscoring 0 of 10 in a survey of the 30 largest global insurers.\u201d Whatever his feelings about climate change, Mr. Buffett regards surveys and checklist-style scorecards as wasteful sloth \u2014 the enemy of good management. He has advised shareholders to vote against all six proposals. (This is a good place to note: I\u2019m not only a Warren Buffett biographer, I\u2019m also a long-term Berkshire stockholder.)",
      "How did Wall Street\u2019s wealthiest liberal come to be a refusenik? The simple answer is that Mr. Buffett hasn\u2019t changed even as the political climate has. Mr. Buffett was the son of a conservative Republican who served four terms in Congress. While he inherited his father\u2019s sense of fiscal prudence, Mr. Buffett in the 1960s switched his primary allegiance to the Democrats because of their leadership on civil rights. For him, meritocracy is a transcendent value. He abhors discrimination; for not dissimilar reasons, he sneers at trust fund babies for receiving an undeserved head start and ",
      " to give an overwhelming majority of his wealth to charity, not to his kids. He also has broken from his father\u2019s small-government credo and often praises American democracy for creating the conditions for prosperity.",
      "Mr. Buffett parts company from boardroom progressives for two reasons, one having to do with style, the other substance. He is fiercely independent, not surprisingly for a contrarian investor. He takes pains to control his agenda; over the years, friends who asked for even a token contribution to a pet cause were typically disappointed. In his mid-70s, Mr. Buffett announced he would leave the bulk of his estate to the foundation run by his friend Bill Gates. Other than that, he does not outsource his political or social convictions.",
      "This inner-directed style colors everything about Berkshire. Unlike other C.E.O.s, Mr. Buffett does not employ handlers or spokespeople. Calls are typically answered in seconds, not hours. Even Berkshire\u2019s proxy statement reflects Mr. Buffett\u2019s minimalism (many are weighty tomes; Berkshire\u2019s is 19 pages).",
      "Although Berkshire is a corporate octopus with 383,000 ",
      " and more than 60 operating groups \u2014 everything from energy and manufacturing to residential brokerage and a premium candy brand \u2014 only 26 employees work in the corporate office. It eschews corporatewide directives and procedures, letting the units run with near autonomy.",
      "Two of its businesses, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF Railway, account for more than 90 percent of the company\u2019s fossil fuels consumption; each discloses its carbon footprint and a timeline for reduction. Berkshire Energy, which serves 12 million customers, ",
      " half of its electricity stems from noncarbon fuels. (About 40 percent of electricity in the United States is ",
      " using zero-carbon fuels.) Berkshire Energy has invested more than $30 billion in renewables, much of it on infrastructure to, as Mr. Buffett puts it, get power from where the wind blows to where people live. Meanwhile, it has been shuttering coal facilities.",
      "But Mr. Buffett rejects what he regards as implausible deadlines, mocking with studied impartiality both \u201cdefenders of the old order\u201d and \u201cunrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly new world.\u201d He rebuffs the idea that the insurance unit, for example, should monitor the carbon use of ",
      " customers. The insurance subsidiary, the proxy notes, is in the business of gauging risk. In terms of the potential effect on profits \u2014 the reason for securities disclosure \u2014 Mr. Buffett does not distinguish politically charged categories such as climate from other risks. He bristles at the idea of subjecting Berkshire\u2019s operating groups, which have vastly different energy profiles, to a boilerplate.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be preparing a lot of reports and asking 60 subsidiaries each to do something,\u201d Mr. Buffett said at a past meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to spend the time of the people at Berkshire Hathaway Energy responding to questionnaires or trying to score better with somebody that is working on that.\u201d He noted that corporate America is worried about activists stirring up controversy, but at Berkshire, where Mr. Buffett owns 31.6 percent of the voting stock, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d",
      "Mr. Buffett has said his critics do not read the company\u2019s disclosures, and he has a point. While Berkshire is attacked for not disclosing enough on diversity, the company, as required, provides reams of data to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which it makes public (58 percent of its insurance work force is female; 45 percent in service/retail/distribution identify as diverse). But it declines to issue a separate report on its diversity efforts. And few corporations would proclaim, as Berkshire does, that it \u201cdoes not have a policy\u201d on how diversity affects consideration of board nominees.",
      "Since four directors are women and two are ethnically or racially diverse, this might seem a matter of semantics. But there is a genuine gulf between Mr. Buffett and progressive critics. Mr. Buffett\u2019s liberalism is of the classic Adam Smith variety: Private initiative, properly regulated, leads to social good. That used to be just about everyone\u2019s view, but no more.",
      "Corporate boards are now assembled like political platforms, with consummate attention to satisfying multiple interests. Berkshire chooses directors on the basis of \u201cbusiness savvy\u201d and owner \u2014 not \u201cstakeholder\u201d \u2014 orientation. In short, Mr. Buffett remains a full-throated believer that boards exist to represent shareholders.",
      "In his 2021 letter to stockholders, he recalled that before he assumed control of Berkshire, which was then a struggling textile manufacturer, it contributed a \u201cpathetic\u201d $100 per day in federal taxes. After decades of growth and diversification (textiles are long gone), the tab has risen to $9 million per day \u2014 1/1000th of all individual ",
      " business federal taxes paid, he calculated. Mr. Buffett\u2019s message was that profitability is a social good, demonstrating the \u201coften unrecognized financial partnership between government and American businesses.\u201d",
      "A small part of Berkshire\u2019s profit, and thus its taxes, stemmed from share buybacks \u2014 a corporate tactic that progressives have taken dead aim at. In his most recent letter, Mr. Buffett came close to calling such critics anti-business know-nothings. He regards share repurchases as a perfectly valid tool for managing capital; when he labeled criticism of buybacks as coming from \u201ceither an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue,\u201d he seemed to be ",
      " some congressional Democrats as well as President Biden, who have legislated taxes on buybacks.",
      "Repurchasing (undervalued) shares conforms to Mr. Buffett\u2019s belief that the C.E.O.\u2019s duty is to protect, and over time enhance, per-share value. His reverence for guarding shareholders\u2019 interests is seen in his asceticism on compensation. Many chief executives espouse progressive principles; few apply them to their own paychecks. Mr. Buffett has never taken a stock option nor more than $100,000 in salary. (He also is compensated for security services for the house he has lived in since the late 1950s.) Nor does Berkshire pay dividends; Mr. Buffett thinks he can do better for shareholders by retaining their capital. Since Mr. Buffett, personally, has never sold a share, his $100 billion in Berkshire stock is effectively being held in trust for future generations. He supports his lifestyle with assets outside of Berkshire.",
      "If form holds, at Saturday\u2019s meeting Mr. Buffett \u2014 and his sidekick, the curmudgeonly vice chairman Charlie Munger \u2014 will get plenty of questions related to corporate governance and even politics. Neither is likely to change his mind, and most shareholders seem to like it that way. Last year, assuming the dissident votes came from institutions, individual holders overwhelmingly backed management. Mr. Buffett may not conform to the fashionable standards of the Business Roundtable, but he is still in good graces with one group \u2014 individuals who trust him to manage their savings.",

      "There are a few reasons to think that President Biden might lose his bid for re-election next year, even if Donald Trump is once more \u2014 for the third straight time \u2014 the Republican nominee.",
      "There\u2019s the Electoral College, which could still favor the Republican Party just enough to give Trump 270 electoral votes, even if he doesn\u2019t win a popular majority. There\u2019s Biden\u2019s overall standing \u2014 around 43 percent of Americans ",
      " of his job performance \u2014 which doesn\u2019t compare favorably with past incumbents who did win re-election. There\u2019s the economy, which may hit a downturn between now and next November. And even if it doesn\u2019t, Biden will still have presided over the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. Last, there\u2019s Biden himself. The oldest person ever elected president, next year he will be \u2014 at 81 \u2014 the oldest president to ever stand for re-election. Biden\u2019s age is a real risk that could suddenly become a liability.",
      "If Biden has potential weaknesses, however, it is also true that he doesn\u2019t lack for real advantages. Along with low unemployment, there\u2019s been meaningful economic growth, and he can point to significant legislative accomplishments. The Democratic Party is behind him; he has no serious rivals for the nomination.",
      "But Biden\u2019s biggest advantage has to do with the opposition \u2014 the Republican Party has gotten weird. It\u2019s not just that Republican policies are well outside the mainstream, but that the party itself has tipped over into something very strange.",
      "I had this thought while ",
      " from a lectern to an audience we can\u2019t see. In the video, which his press team highlighted on Twitter, DeSantis decries the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d which he calls \u201ca form of cultural Marxism that tries to divide us based on identity politics.\u201d",
      "Now, I can follow this as a professional internet user and political observer. I know that \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d is a term of art for the (condescending and misguided) idea that progressive views on race and gender are an outside contagion threatening the minds of young people who might otherwise reject structural explanations of racial inequality and embrace a traditional vision of the gender binary. I know that \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d is a right-wing buzzword meant to sound scary and imposing.",
      "To a normal person, on the other hand, this language is borderline unintelligible. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything; it doesn\u2019t obviously mean anything; and it\u2019s quite likely to be far afield of your interests and concerns.",
      "DeSantis is a regular offender when it comes to speaking in the jargon of culture war-obsessed conservatives, but he\u2019s not the only one. And it\u2019s not just a problem of jargon. Republican politicians \u2014 from presidential contenders to anonymous state legislators \u2014 are monomaniacally focused on banning books, fighting \u201cwokeness\u201d and harassing transgender people. Some Republicans are even still denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, doubling down on the election-related conspiracies that hobbled many Republican candidates in the midterms.",
      "Not only do Americans not care about the various Republican obsessions \u2014 in ",
      " 1 percent of respondents said \u201cwokeness\u201d was \u201cthe most important issue facing the country today\u201d \u2014 but a large majority say that those obsessions have gone too far. According to Fox, 60 percent of Americans said \u201cbook banning by school boards\u201d was a major problem. Fifty-seven percent said the same for political attacks on families with transgender children.",
      "It is not for nothing that in ",
      " of the 2024 campaign, he took specific aim at conservative book bans as a threat to freedom and American democracy.",
      "And yet there\u2019s no sign that Republicans will relent and shift focus. Just the opposite, in fact; the party is poised to lurch even farther down the road of its alienating preoccupations. On abortion, for example, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, says candidates need to address the issue \u201c",
      "\u201d in 2024 \u2014 that they can\u2019t be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d on the issue and need to say \u201cI\u2019m proud to be pro-life.\u201d",
      "But the Republican Party has veered quite far from most Americans on abortion rights, and in a contested race for the presidential nomination, a \u201chead-on\u201d focus will possibly mean a fight over which candidate can claim the most draconian abortion views and policy aims.",
      "There\u2019s more: DeSantis is in the midst of a legal battle with Disney, one of the most beloved companies on the planet, and House Republicans are ",
      " the global economy in order to pass a set of deeply unpopular spending cuts to widely used assistance programs.",
      "Taken together, it\u2019s as if the Republican Party has committed itself to being as off-putting as possible to as many Americans as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean the party is doomed, of course. But as of this moment, it is hard to say it\u2019s on the road to political success.",
      "As for Joe Biden? The current state of the Republican Party only strengthens his most important political asset \u2014 his normalcy. He promised, in 2020, that he would be a normal president. And he is promising, for 2024, to continue to serve as a normal president. Normal isn\u2019t fun and normal isn\u2019t exciting. But normal has already won one election, and I won\u2019t be surprised if it wins another."

Some of it, I think, is coming from Putin sympathizers, who want us to believe that America will be punished for, as they see it, \u201cweaponizing\u201d the dollar against the invasion of \u2014 I mean, special military operation in \u2014 Ukraine.",
      " is among those warning that weaponizing the dollar will destroy its reserve currency status, because of course he is.",
      "But what inspired me to write about the subject (again) is that lately more sober voices, who should know better, are sounding the alarm. International relations experts like ",
      " warn that the dollar is a superpower we\u2019re in danger of losing. Even economic analysts like ",
      ", whom I\u2019ve found to be a valuable source of insights on China, seem to believe that dollar dominance is the only reason America can run persistent large trade deficits.",
      "All of this is very odd. Even if you believe that the dollar\u2019s dominance is in imminent danger \u2014 which you shouldn\u2019t \u2014 a look at what that dominance actually entails makes it clear that the importance of controlling the world\u2019s reserve currency is greatly overrated.",
      "What do we mean by saying that the dollar is a dominant currency? There\u2019s a very nice summary in the first few pages of a ",
      " by Gita Gopinath, now a top official at the International Monetary Fund, and Jeremy Stein. As they note, much of world trade is invoiced and settled in U.S. dollars; many banks based outside the United States nonetheless offer dollar-denominated deposits; many non-U.S. corporations borrow in dollars; central banks hold a large share of their reserves in dollar assets; and maybe (the evidence here is ",
      ") interest rates are lower, other things equal, when you borrow in dollars than when you borrow in other currencies.",
      "This is all very impressive. But how much of it redounds to the benefit of the U.S. economy? Why, exactly, should America care whether a contract between Chinese exporters and Brazilian importers is written in dollars as opposed to yuan or reais?",
      "A lot of what\u2019s written about this subject begins with the assertion that the special role of the dollar gives America a unique ability to run a large balance of payments deficits, year after year, presumably because the dollar\u2019s status forces other countries to accept our money. But even a quick look at the data shows that this claim is false. Yes, America has run persistent deficits, but so have other countries. We\u2019re not even at the top of the league table.",
      "Let\u2019s look at the balance of payments on current accounts \u2014 the trade balance broadly defined, so as to include services and investment income, such as interest payments, as well as trade in goods. And let\u2019s look at advanced economies that have their own currencies \u2014 that is, leave out members of the euro area. Here\u2019s what we get for the decade before Covid struck:",
      "It turns out that there are multiple nations able to run persistent deficits, and several have run bigger deficits relative to the size of their economies than we have. Britain, which has the deepest deficits, used to own a globally dominant currency \u2014 but the pound sterling stopped playing any important international role generations ago. The Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar have never been widely used outside their issuing nations.",
      "So where does the idea that dollar dominance gives us a special ability to run deficits come from? I guess it\u2019s just something that sounds as if it should be true, which I\u2019ll come back to in a minute. But first, are there any other ways in which America gains special advantages from the dollar\u2019s dominance?",
      "Well, it\u2019s possible that the worldwide use of the dollar creates the perception that dollar bonds are safe assets, so that America can borrow more cheaply than other nations. It\u2019s hard to tell, because there are multiple factors affecting interest rates \u2014 and U.S. borrowing costs are not, in fact, noticeably lower than those of ",
      ". If there\u2019s any effect, however, it must be small. I won\u2019t go through the arithmetic, but I can\u2019t see any way that, considering all this together, dollar dominance is worth more to America than a fraction of 1 percent of G.D.P.",
      "Why, then, are people making such a big deal over the possible end of dollar dominance? The answer, I believe, is that global currency issues come across as glamorous and mysterious, so people imagine that they must be important \u2014 and yes, some people like to talk about them because they think it makes them sound sophisticated. You have to actually work with the numbers to appreciate how little is really at stake.",
      "Which means that I\u2019m almost reluctant to add that reports of the dollar\u2019s coming demise are also probably greatly exaggerated. The aforementioned paper by Gopinath and Stein offers a detailed analysis of one channel through which the dollar maintains its dominance, adding to a long literature that includes, among other things, some old papers by yours truly. The bottom line in most of this analysis is that the dollar is widely used because it\u2019s widely used \u2014 that all of the various roles the dollar plays create a web of self-reinforcement, keeping the dollar pre-eminent.",
      "The point is that tugging on one or two strands of this web isn\u2019t likely to cause it to unravel. Even if some governments express a desire to see payments conducted in other currencies, it\u2019s not at all clear they can make that happen, since we\u2019re mostly talking about private-sector decisions. And even if they can make partial de-dollarization stick, all the other advantages of the dollar as a banking and borrowing currency will remain.",
      "So ignore all the dollar doomers out there. Or better yet, consider what their hyping of a nonissue says about their own judgment.",

That movement brought hopes that Sudan, with its belated Arab Spring-style uprising, could finally turn the page toward democracy.",
      "But the process was booby-trapped from the beginning. The two military leaders had helped remove al-Bashir from office and made noises about civilian power, even agreeing to create a temporary transitional civilian government under their authority. It quickly became clear that they had no serious intention of giving up power. In October 2021, they staged a coup. Having vanquished civilian rule, the two men then turned on each other, and the people of Sudan are caught in the middle.",
      "The diplomatic efforts in the region in the months leading up to the current crisis were handled by a jumble of midlevel diplomats from an alphabet soup of regional and international bodies, and regional leaders are nowhere to be seen.",
      "The Sudan scholar Alex de Waal called it \u201ca low-level diplomatic traffic jam\u201d ",
      ". \u201cNo one wanted what has now transpired \u2014 but no one was coordinating the signaling to prevent it from happening.\u201d",
      "One question regional diplomats and Sudanese analysts and officials I spoke to kept asking was: Where is the United States?",
      "In an increasingly multipolar world, the United States may lack the leverage and stature it once had to bend events to its will. That may not be such a bad thing: Pax Americana often came at a price to sovereignty and self-determination, especially for the people of the Global South. But that doesn\u2019t make the United States any less indispensable as a force for peace, stability and democracy at this time. In the past, the United States has played an essential role in bringing together seemingly irreconcilable antagonists and their regional proxies to find a path to peace in Sudan. On Monday the glaring lack of high-level diplomacy prompted a bipartisan statement from the House Foreign Affairs Committee ",
      " and the United Nations to appoint senior envoys, saying \u201cdirect, sustained, high-level leadership from the United States and United Nations is necessary to stop the fighting from dragging the country into a full-blown civil war and state collapse.\u201d",
      "It may be tempting to throw up our hands and say a peaceful transition to civilian rule in Sudan was an impossible mission. Sudan has been at war with itself for almost 40 of its 67 years as an independent nation. And yet there is ample evidence that high-level diplomacy by a range of international and regional actors was effective in the past, making the vacuum now all the more appalling.",
      "Sudan\u2019s future once preoccupied Republican and Democratic presidential administrations alike. Ending the civil war between northern and southern Sudan was such an important priority for the administration of George W. Bush that he dispatched a friend and ally, the former senator John Danforth, as an envoy.",
      "The Obama administration sent high-level envoys to rally regional powers and cajole combatants when the peace agreement between north and south seemed headed off the rails. Important regional figures stepped up, too: Former presidents of South Africa and Nigeria were deeply involved, along with the then-prime minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, in keeping the agreement on track as south Sudan moved toward a referendum that would split the country.",
      "By contrast, the current crisis has largely involved midlevel technocrats. Volker Perthes, the top United Nations official in Sudan, admitted in an interview with ",
      " this week that despite the rising tensions between the generals, \u201cof course, we did not see it coming.\u201d",
      "This is vexing because if anything, Sudan has become more of a strategic priority for the United States and Sudan\u2019s neighbors. It is not only among Africa\u2019s largest nations but also sits at the watery crossroads of north and sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Its neighbors and regional influences include a highly combustible mix of some of the most ",
      ": Somalia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates. America\u2019s biggest geopolitical rivals \u2014 China and Russia \u2014 have significant interests in Sudan and in the current conflict.",
      "But as always, beneath the geopolitics, there are real people, with real aspirations for their country.",
      "There is a tendency to focus on armed actors as above all else and a sort of dismissal of the range of civilian actors \u2014 political parties, protest movement leaders, civil society \u2014 as a bunch of cats too difficult to herd.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always been this argument that the civilians can\u2019t get their act together,\u201d another senior Western diplomat in the region told me. \u201cThe goal is to build a democracy with pluralism. Yes, it\u2019s messy. Democracy is messy.\u201d",
      "Sudanese civilian leaders are no less scathing in their assessment of diplomatic efforts.",
      "\u201cThey were actually fostering a political process that increased the polarization and the lust for power between the armed factions to the extent that it exploded,\u201d said Amjed Farid, a former official in the transitional civilian administration. \u201cYou cannot bring democracy by exclusion. We saw this too many times in Africa. It is about including the demands of the normal people in the streets.\u201d",
      "Someone will need to shepherd the complex transition to civilian rule, and someone will need to underwrite it. This will not be cheap. The military will need to be bought off, its streams of revenue from its capture of the state replaced. Sudan will need long-term support, money that will ensure the independence of the civilian government.",
      "The military dictatorship was brought down in part by an economic crisis, and the surest way to tank a new civilian government would be to hamstring it with the Washington Consensus regime of austerity. However dear this might be, it is nothing compared with the cost of a festering civil war.",
      "Sudan is simply too big and too strategically located to fail. Its neighbors and regional powers know this, which is they have been so deeply involved in the two sides of the conflict. Most of the Gulf countries involved are either indifferent or hostile to the quest for democracy in Sudan. Egypt, a country that seems to forget that Sudan is no longer its colony, has ",
      " to the Sudanese military and is staunchly opposed to a democracy on its southern border.",
      "But the only real solution to Sudan\u2019s crisis is the hard one: A new nation must be built, departing sharply from its past of Islamic extremist-inflected military rule. The people of Sudan deserve the chance, finally, to govern themselves by common assent, free from the dictatorship of the gun.",
      "Now that Sudan\u2019s endless wars have reached Khartoum, the capital, the world has no excuse for failing to help shepherd this troubled giant to democracy. If the realpolitik of regional and international security once argued for abiding by military rule for stability\u2019s sake, that logic is now inverted. A messy fight among the security services in the streets of Khartoum has demonstrated, once and for all, that the men with guns are the cause of, not the solution to, Sudan\u2019s suffering.",
      "The United States keeps telling the world that it stands for democracy and against autocracy, military rule and impunity. And yet that message has been muddled by its support for important allies like India and Israel that are clearly sliding toward authoritarianism. The crisis in Sudan offers a clear opportunity to live up to the grand ideals the United States has been bruiting about across the world. And yet the United States seems curiously mute or even absent.",
      "\u201cDespite all the rhetoric to the contrary, I don\u2019t believe that the Biden administration has shown sufficient commitment to democracy, and Sudan is the perfect example of that,\u201d said Kholood Khair, a Sudanese political analyst. \u201cI think, when push comes to shove, there is still a preference for armed actors in hierarchical institutions.\u201d",
      "Khair was in Khartoum, and as we spoke, she kept an ear out for gunfire and bomb blasts. We talked about mutual friends who were trapped in the fighting.",
      "\u201cWe keep away from the windows, of course,\u201d she said. Most of the time, this bustling city has been reduced to silence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s deathly quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sound of traffic. There\u2019s no sound of the usual fruit and vegetable vendors that sort of roam around neighborhoods.\u201d Two things puncture the silence, one irregular and the other like clockwork \u2014 the staccato clatter of gunfire and artillery, and the call to prayer. Within a few days Khair had ",

      "It will do so, he added, \u201cby giving people everywhere access to the sum of the world\u2019s knowledge \u2014 in their own language, in their preferred mode of communication, via text, speech, images or code,\u201d delivered by smartphone, through television, radio or e-book. A lot more people will be able to get the best assistance and the best answers to improve their lives.",
      "But we also must be responsible, Manyika added, citing several concerns. First, these tools need to be fully aligned with humanity\u2019s goals. Second, in the wrong hands, these tools could do enormous harm, whether we are talking about disinformation, perfectly faked things or hacking. (Bad guys are always early adopters.)",
      "Finally, \u201cthe engineering is ahead of the science to some degree,\u201d Manyika explained. That is, even the people building these so-called large language models that underlie products like ChatGPT and Bard don\u2019t fully understand how they work and the full extent of their capabilities. We can engineer extraordinarily capable A.I. systems, he added, that can been shown a few examples of arithmetic, or a rare language or explanations of jokes, and that then can start to do many more things with just those fragments astonishingly well. In other words, we don\u2019t fully understand yet how much more good stuff or bad stuff these systems can do.",
      "So, we need some regulation, but it needs to be done carefully and iteratively. One size will not fit all.",
      "Why? Well, if you are most worried about China beating America in A.I., you want to turbocharge our A.I. innovation, not slow it down. If you want to truly democratize A.I., you might want to open-source its code. But open-sourcing can be exploited. What would ISIS do with the code? So, you have to think about arms control. If you are worried that A.I. systems will compound discrimination, privacy violations and other divisive societal harms, the way social networks do, you want regulations now.",
      "If you want to take advantage of all the productivity gains A.I. is expected to generate, you need to focus on creating new opportunities and safety nets for all the paralegals, researchers, financial advisers, translators and rote workers ",
      ", and maybe lawyers and coders tomorrow. If you are worried that A.I. will become superintelligent and start defining its own goals, irrespective of human harm, you want to stop it immediately.",
      "That last danger is real enough that on Monday Geoffrey Hinton, one of the pioneering designers of A.I. systems, announced that he was leaving Google\u2019s A.I. team. Hinton said that he thought ",
      " in rolling out its A.I. products but that he wanted to be free to speak out about all the risks. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u201d Hinton ",
      ".",
      "Add it all up and it says one thing: We as a society are on the cusp of having to decide on some very big trade-offs as we introduce generative A.I.",
      "And government regulation alone will not save us. I have a simple rule: The faster the pace of change and the more godlike powers we humans develop, the more everything old and slow matters more than ever \u2014 the more everything you learned in Sunday school, or from wherever you draw ethical inspiration, matters more than ever.",
      "Because the wider we scale artificial intelligence, the more the golden rule needs to scale: Do unto others as you would wish them to do unto you. Because given the increasingly godlike powers we\u2019re endowing ourselves with, we can all now do unto each other faster, cheaper and deeper than ever before.",
      "Ditto when it comes to the climate Pandora\u2019s box we\u2019re opening. As NASA ",
      " on its website, \u201cIn the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods.\u201d The last ice age ended some 11,700 years ago, giving way to our current climate era \u2014 known as the Holocene (meaning \u201c",
      "\u201d) \u2014 which was characterized by stable seasons that allowed for stable agriculture, the building of human communities and ultimately civilization as we know it today.",
      "\u201cMost of these climate changes are attributed to ",
      " that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives,\u201d ",

      " among environmentalists \u2014 and geological experts at the International Union of Geological Sciences, the professional organization responsible for defining Earth\u2019s geological/climate eras \u2014 about whether we humans have driven ourselves out of the Holocene into a new epoch, called the ",

      "Earth system scientists fear that this man-made epoch, the Anthropocene, will have none of the predictable seasons of the Holocene. Farming could become a nightmare.",
      "But here is where A.I. could be our savior \u2014 by hastening breakthroughs in material science, battery density, fusion energy and safe modular nuclear energy that enable humans to manage the impacts of climate change that are now unavoidable and to avoid those that would be unmanageable.",

      "The rule is the latest in a series of increasingly ambitious moves by California and the federal government to curb planet-warming pollution from vehicles, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gases.",
      "The California Air Resources Board approved the regulation, which by 2045 would fully eliminate the sale of new trucks that emit carbon dioxide across the state. The rule builds in intermediate goals in the coming years for government organizations and private companies to decrease their use of diesel trucks.",
      "The ban, if approved by the federal government, would create the most stringent practices related to truck emissions in the country, keeping California at the forefront of states in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Some large companies have already begun to use heavy-duty vehicles that emit little to no carbon dioxide, but the plan would require a complete transition in new truck purchases by 2036.",
      "\u201cThis rule provides manufacturers, truck owners and fueling providers the assurance that there will be a market and the demand for zero-emissions vehicles, while providing a flexible path to making the transition toward clean air,\u201d Liane Randolph, chair of the board, said in a statement.",

The state has for decades been at the vanguard of the nation\u2019s clean air regulations. California is unique among the states in that the 1970 Clean Air Act allows it to set tighter air pollution rules than those used by the federal government \u2014 and historically, when it does so, the federal government often follows. While the ban on diesel truck sales would be the only one of its kind in the world, many other states and, eventually, the federal government could enact similar policies, which could in turn influence global policies, since trucks are manufactured and driven around the world.",

For the past several years, as his robusta trees have succumbed to pests and disease, he has replaced them with Liberica trees. On his six acres Mr. John now has just 50 robustas, and 1,000 Libericas.",

      "Another variety is Liberica excelsa, the one that is native to the lowlands of Uganda. Compared with robusta, which is also native to Uganda and the dominant coffee species grown in the region, Liberica takes longer to mature and produce fruit.",
      "Libericas tower over robustas. Each tree can grow to a height of eight meters, so farmers need to hoist themselves up on bamboo ladders to harvest them. Or else they need to prune the trees so their branches grow wide and not up.",
      "Around 200 farmers have been growing Liberica in small pockets, selling it to local traders together with their robusta harvest, and getting robusta prices. Dr. Kiwuka said she felt as though the farmers \u201cwere cheated.\u201d",
      "Liberica has a stronger aroma and is a higher quality coffee, she said; farmers should have been getting higher prices.",
      "In 2016, she invited Aaron Davis, a coffee scientist from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, England, to Zirobwe. He was skeptical at first. He had tasted Liberica elsewhere and found it to be like \u201cvegetable soup,\u201d he said.",

      "Dr. Kiwuka and Dr. Davis teamed up. They would encourage farmers to improve the harvesting and drying of their Liberica crop. Instead of tossing them in with the robusta beans, they would sell the Libericas separately. If they met certain standards, they would get a higher price.",

      "Pitcher plants supplement their diets with this one strange trick: ",
      ". Usually found growing in relatively poor soil, the plants sprout pitcher-shaped cups with pretty, frilly tops that obscure their true purpose: trapping hapless insects. Look inside the pitchers and you\u2019ll find the half-digested bodies of the plants\u2019 victims.",
      "How do insects wind up in this unenviable situation? Do they just, ",
      ", fall in by accident? While studies suggest that the plants\u2019 colors and its nectar may attract prey, some scientists think pitchers\u2019 scent may play a role as well.",
      "In a study published ",
      ", a research team identified odor molecules emanating from four types of pitcher plants and found that the scents seemed to be correlated with the kinds of insects that wound up in the pitchers. While the study is small and more work is needed to confirm the link, the findings suggest that when insects meet their deaths at the bottom of a pitcher, it may be an aroma they\u2019re following.",
      "Humans tend to describe a pitcher plants\u2019 scent as floral or herbal, said Laurence Gaume, a scientist the French National Centre for Scientific Research and an author of the new paper. Insects may find the scent more striking. ",
      " that pitchers emitting more volatile compounds tended to attract more flies, but rigorous examinations of what exactly pitchers release and whether it\u2019s connected to the insects they attract have been missing.",
      "To answer this question, Dr. Gaume and her colleagues grew four different types of Sarracenia",
      "pitcher plants at their research station in Montpelier, France. They sampled the air above 39 of the pitchers, identifying dozens of volatile compounds, and sliced a number of pitchers open to sort through their contents. They also measured the pitchers\u2019 width and depth, to see whether their shape contributed to the type of prey they caught.",
      "Pitchers with aromas that were heavy on monoterpenes, fragrant substances known to attract pollinators, seemed to catch more moths and bees, the group found, while those emitting more fatty acids ended up with more flies and ants. Pitcher shape, too, was correlated with certain kinds of prey: Longer pitchers were heavier on bees and moths, while shorter pitchers caught more ants.",
      "In other words, it seems unlikely that insects are just falling into a given pitcher by chance, Dr. Gaume said.",
      "Future experiments might probe whether pitcher scents painted onto fake plants draw insects\u2019 attention the same way, or whether altering pitcher color or shape affect the allure of the odors.",
      "Some of the pitcher plants used in Dr. Gaume and colleagues\u2019 research are native to North America \u2014 in fact, they can be found in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Dr. Gaume wonders whether the same connections between scents emitted and prey caught would show up in plants grown outside of the experimental conditions of the study. She has hopes of a much larger study in North America someday to further explore these findings, with row after row of sprightly death traps, all releasing come-hither odors into the air."

      "But scientists didn\u2019t just affix this device for laughs: They are curious about the underlying brain mechanisms that allow fish to navigate their world, and how such mechanisms relate to the evolutionary roots of navigation for all creatures with brain circuitry.",
      "\u201cNavigation is an extremely important aspect of behavior because we navigate to find food, to find shelter, to escape predators,\u201d said Ronen Segev, a neuroscientist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel who was part of a team that fitted 15 fish with cybernetic headgear for a study ",
      ".",
      "Putting a computer on a goldfish to study how the neurons fire in its brain while navigating wasn\u2019t easy.",
      "It takes a careful hand because a goldfish\u2019s brain, which looks a bit like a small cluster of lentils, is only half an inch long. \u201cUnder a microscope, we exposed the brain and put the electrodes inside,\u201d said Lear Cohen, a neuroscientist and doctoral candidate at Ben-Gurion who performed the surgeries to attach the devices. Each of those electrodes was the diameter of a strand of human hair.",
      "It was also tricky to find a way to perform the procedure on dry land without harming the test subject. \u201cThe fish needs water and you need him not to move,\u201d he said. He and his colleagues solved both problems by pumping water and anesthetics into the fish\u2019s mouth.",
      "Once the electrodes were in the brain, they were connected to a small recording device, which could monitor neuronal activity and which was sealed in a waterproof case, mounted on the fish\u2019s forehead. To keep the computer from weighing the fish down and impeding its ability to swim, the researchers attached buoyant plastic foam to the device.",
      "After recovering from surgery, the fish debuted their headgear in an experiment. The goldfish navigated a two-foot-long, six-inch-wide tank. The closer the fish swam to the tank\u2019s edges, the more the navigational cells in their brains lit up.",
      "The fish\u2019s brain-computer helped reveal that goldfish use a system of navigation that is subtly different from ",
      ". For humans (and other members of our class), navigational cells specialize in pinging our precise location within our environment and building a map around that spot. Mammals have specialized neurons that create these \u201cyou are here\u201d pins in their mental maps; the researchers didn\u2019t find those cells in fish.",
      "Instead, goldfish rely on a type of neuron that fires to let the animal know it is approaching a boundary or an obstacle. By combining the information about how far it is from various barriers, the fish is able to orient itself in space.",
      "The mammalian navigation system, Dr. Segev said, amounts to cells that let an animal determine \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here.\u201d In goldfish, he said, the cells work to impart a different message: \u201cI\u2019m in this position along this axis, and this position along a different axis.\u201d",
      "Mr. Cohen suspects that the variations in animals\u2019 navigation circuits may correspond to the different challenges they face getting around their habitats. For instance, he said, the ever-shifting currents of a watery home could mean that, for fish, \u201cit\u2019s easier to know the distance from a salient feature in the environment than knowing an exact position.\u201d",
      "All of the experiments were approved by the university\u2019s animal welfare committee and the researchers euthanized the fish after their swimming trials so they could further examine their brains. The team hopes to continue learning how and why fish\u2019s navigational systems differ from ours.",
      "Adelaide Sibeaux, a biologist at Oxford University who was not involved with the study, said she found the project \u201cpretty amazing\u201d as well as important.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re modifying a lot of animals\u2019 environments, and, if you understand how an animal navigates, you will know if they are able to cope with changes that are happening in the world at the moment,\u201d Dr. Sibeaux said; for fish, that could include water that becomes murkier because of pollution."

      ", returned in 2017, this time in a video showing ",
      " a kiddie pool with a level of wild enthusiasm rivaling the most committed human dancer at an all-night rave.",
      "Humans\u2019 love of spinning around in circles, especially during childhood, is evidenced by the enduring popularity of playground merry-go-rounds, revolving fun park rides and the irresistible draw of somersaulting down a hill. But new research suggests that humans are not alone in their pursuit of spin-induced buzzes.",
      "According to findings ",
      ", other great ape species also seem to regularly enjoy stimulating their senses through spinning, possibly even in pursuit of altered mental states.",
      "\u201cSpinning around to make ourselves dizzy is something we usually think of as a distinctly human activity,\u201d said Marcus Perlman, a cognitive scientist at the University of Birmingham in England and an author of the study. \u201cSo it\u2019s really cool to find that other primates do this, too, and that they seem to do it for the same reason that children do: because it\u2019s fun and exhilarating.\u201d",
      "After Dr. Perlman saw the videos of Zola, he turned to YouTube to investigate whether other apes engaged in the behavior. He amassed nearly 400 videos showing great apes and other primates engaged in spinning behaviors, including somersaulting, rolling down hills, backflipping and pirouetting. But the new paper focuses on clips of apes spinning on ropes or ropelike materials.",
      "Dr. Perlman and Adriano Lameira, a primatologist and evolutionary psychologist at the University of Warwick in England, found 132 instances of rope-spinning across 40 videos involving orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. The videos mostly featured captive apes, but several involved wild mountain gorillas on vines.",
      "The researchers calculated the speed at which the apes spun. Most of the apes, they found, spun at an average rotation velocity of 1.43 revolutions per second \u2014 a speed rivaling professionally trained human dancers and aerialists. The longest spin session lasted 28 revolutions, and the fastest \u2014 achieved by a bonobo \u2014 clocked in at a brain-scrambling four revolutions per second.",
      "The researchers observed that the longer an ape spun, the more likely it was to show signs of dizziness, such as letting go of the rope and immediately sitting or lying down. Apes tended to repeat the process of spinning and stopping, engaging in an average of three bouts of spinning per session.",
      "The animals also often made \u201cplay faces\u201d while spinning, Dr. Perlman said, implying that they were most likely having fun rather than only seeking a way to relieve themselves of boredom in captivity.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the experience they enjoy,\u201d Dr. Perlman said.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who was not involved in the research, concurred. Based on her observations in the field, she said, \u201cwild apes love to spin.\u201d",

      ". Whether this is done on purpose or by accident is debated, Dr. Perlman said. But studies such as this one can begin to provide data needed to explore behaviors that may be evolutionary precursors to the human desire to experience altered mental states.",

      "Moths and other insects are drawn to lights at night as reliably as planets orbit stars.",
      "Entomologists have long exploited this fact by setting out light traps whenever they want to collect insects. Poets have reached for the image of a moth drawn to flame to signify self-destructive behavior in works ranging from \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d",
      "to the Hindu epic the Bhagavad Gita",
      "Ecologists, more recently, ",
      " that the lure of artificial lights across Earth\u2019s nighttime surface may partially explain why insects are in global decline.",
      "But, despite all this, scientists still didn\u2019t know why.",
      "\u201cA lot of entomologists get asked this all the time,\u201d Avalon Owens, a biologist at Harvard, said.",
      "One prevailing theory, popular but flawed, she said, is that flying insects confuse our porch lights for the moon or another celestial body, and their sense of navigation gets scrambled. Another idea is that lights at night look like glimpses of daylight through a thicket of vegetation, prompting insects to try to \u201cescape\u201d by making a beeline toward what they think is open space.",
      "Now, though, ",
      " has the entomology world abuzz. A team led by biologists Samuel Fabian at Imperial College London and Yash Sondhi at Florida International University argue that when many insects see a bright light at night, they believe they\u2019ve found the direction of the sky and attempt to orient themselves along an up-and-down axis. That instinct prompts them to roll their backs toward the light, mistakenly in cases when the source of illumination is on the ground or mounted horizontally, causing them to go into endless, banking turns like a tiny airplane or to crash-land.",
      "The findings were published in a paper that was uploaded to the bioRxiv server but has yet to be peer-reviewed.",
      "In the daytime, entomologists knew, such directional instincts help flying insects stay level by keeping their backs pointed toward sunlight, even during aerial maneuvers. The new analysis, though, shows that lights at night appear to hijack this instinct.",
      "To arrive at this conclusion, the scientists took high-speed, lowlight video of dragonflies, butterflies and moths flying around light bulbs both in the lab and in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. Sometimes the insects would start making circular loops like an orbiting moon. Other times the insects would pass the bulbs, then tilt upward into a stall. Or they would fly above the bulbs, then flip themselves upside down and nose-dive toward the ground.",
      "In each case, though, the slowed-down footage showed that the insects always tried to keep their backs aimed toward the light, a result the team confirmed by gluing little motion trackers on the insects. In turn, the team found through computerized flight simulations that those inadvertent roll maneuvers could explain the bugs\u2019 looping, trapped flight trajectories.",
      "\u201cThis is the best argument so far for what explains this behavior,\u201d said Tyson Hedrick, an expert in the aerodynamics of insect flight at the University of North Carolina who said he had previously favored the idea that lights interfere with the celestial navigation of insects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of these things that we all sort of think we know about nature,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s getting overturned.\u201d",
      "The new study also offers a hint of how to mitigate the effect, which can kill insects in ways that are poetic \u2014 burning up in flame \u2014 or more sinister, like getting trapped in the web of a spider that has learned artificial lights provide prey. Some insects also simply run out of calories by flying in circles.",
      "The research team found that insects seem least affected when they fly under lights that are projected straight down, as opposed to lights that shine upward or that have been mounted horizontally. This finding dovetails with longstanding advice from researchers to limit light pollution by using downward pointing light fixtures that illuminate only the nearby ground.",
      "Aside from beckoning insects, lights can also interfere with the development of caterpillars, cause fireflies to stop flashing, and shrink the habitat of shyer nocturnal species that venture out only in pure darkness, Dr. Owens said.",
      "\u201cThe most effective way of solving this problem is always going to be turning off the lights,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cThe vehicle\u2019s structural margins appear to be better than we expected,\u201d Mr. Musk said.",
      "For the next launch, more explosives could be added to ensure that \u201cthe rocket explodes immediately if flight termination is necessary,\u201d he said.",
      "The other unexpected surprise was the shattering of concrete beneath the rocket at launch. ",
      "The thrust of 30 engines unexpectedly generated a \u201crock tornado\u201d that scattered debris across hundreds of acres and generated a giant dust cloud.",
      "\u201cBasically a human-made sandstorm,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d",
      "Instead of the rocket\u2019s 33 engines firing directly onto the concrete below the rocket at liftoff, a large water-cooled steel plate will be installed. Mr. Musk said the plate was not ready for last week\u2019s launch.",
      "He said the next rocket and repairs to the launchpad would be ready within six to eight weeks. However, the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates rocket launches, is investigating the events of the first launch and will have to be satisfied with SpaceX\u2019s adjustments and improvements before allowing another Starship flight.",
      "The next launch would attempt to accomplish the goals of the first mission \u2014 for the Starship vehicle to successfully detach from the booster and reach space before circling most of the planet and landing in the waters off Hawaii.",
      "Mr. Musk did not promise full success on the second try. He said he expected four or five more Starship launches this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably got an 80 percent probability of reaching orbit this year,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tempt fate, but I think close to 100 percent chance of reaching orbit within 12 months.\u201d",
      "Mr. Musk said SpaceX was spending \u201c$2 billion-ish\u201d on Starship this year and would not need additional investments for development of the rocket.",
      "One of the key uses of Starship will be as the lunar lander during NASA\u2019s Artemis III mission, which is to take astronauts to the moon\u2019s surface near the south pole. Mr. Musk confidently asserted that Starship would be ready before other components like the Space Launch System rocket being built by NASA. \u201cWe will not be a limiting factor at all,\u201d he said.",
      "He also emphasized the technical challenges that SpaceX is attempting to overcome in producing a giant spacecraft that can be rapidly reflown repeatedly, something more like a jetliner.",
      "\u201cThis is certainly a candidate for hardest technical problem done by humans,\u201d Mr. Musk said."

      " tightly wound inside most of our cells. Today, scientists are still struggling to decipher it.",
      "But a ",
      " published in Science on Thursday has cast a bright light into the dark recesses of the human genome by comparing it with those of 239 other mammals, including narwhals, cheetahs and ",
      ".",
      "By tracing this genomic evolution over the past 100 million years, the so-called ",
      " has revealed millions of stretches of human DNA that have changed little since our shrew-like ancestors scurried in the shadows of dinosaurs. These ancient genetic elements most likely carry out essential functions in our bodies today, the project found, and mutations within them can put us at risk of a range of diseases.",
      "The project\u2019s strength lies in the huge amount of data analyzed \u2014 not just the genomes, but experiments on thousands of pieces of DNA and information from medical studies, said Alexander Palazzo, a geneticist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the work. \u201cThis is the way it needs to be done.\u201d",
      "The mammalian genomes also allowed the Zoonomia team to pinpoint pieces of human DNA with radical mutations that set them apart from other mammals. Some of these genetic adaptations may have had a major role in the evolution of our big, complex brains.",
      "The researchers have only scraped the surface of potential revelations in their database. Other researchers say it will serve as a treasure map to guide further explorations of the human genome.",
      "\u201cEvolution\u2019s crucible sees all,\u201d said Jay Shendure, a geneticist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the project.",
      "Scientists have long known that just a tiny fraction of our DNA contains so-called protein-coding genes, which make crucial proteins like digestive enzymes in our stomach, collagen in our skin and hemoglobin in our blood. All of our 20,000 protein-coding genes make up just 1.5 percent of our genome. The other 98.5 percent is ",
      ".",
      "Scientists have found that some bits of that inscrutable DNA help determine which proteins get made at certain places and at certain times. Other pieces of DNA act like switches, turning on nearby genes. And still others can amplify the production of those genes. And still others act like off switches.",
      "Through painstaking experiments, scientists have uncovered thousands of these switches nestled in long stretches of DNA that seem to do nothing for us \u2014 what some biologists call \u201cjunk DNA.\u201d Our genome contains thousands of broken copies of ",
      ", for example, and vestiges of ",
      " of our distant ancestors.",
      "But it\u2019s not yet possible for scientists to look directly at the human genome and identify all the switches. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the language that makes these things work,\u201d said Steven Reilly, a geneticist at the Yale School of Medicine and one of more than 100 members of the Zoonomia team.",
      "When the project began over a decade ago",
      " the researchers recognized that evolution could help them decipher this language. They reasoned that switches that endure for millions of years are probably essential to our survival.",
      "In every generation, mutations randomly strike the DNA of every species. If they hit a piece of DNA that isn\u2019t essential, they will cause no harm and may be passed down to future generations.",
      "Mutations that destroy an essential switch, on the other hand, probably won\u2019t get passed down. They may instead kill a mammal, such as by turning off genes essential for organ development. \u201cYou just won\u2019t get a kidney,\u201d said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and Uppsala University who initiated the Zoonomia Project.",
      "Dr. Lindblad-Toh and her colleagues determined that they would need to compare more than 200 mammal genomes to track these mutations over the past 100 million years. They collaborated with wildlife biologists to get tissue from species spread out across the mammalian evolutionary tree.",
      "The scientists worked out the sequence of genetic letters \u2014 known as bases \u2014 in each genome, and compared them with the sequences of other species to determine how mutations arose in different mammalian branches as they evolved from a common ancestor.",
      "\u201cIt took a lot of computer churn,\u201d said Katherine Pollard, a data scientist at Gladstone Institutes who helped build the Zoonomia database.",
      "The researchers found that a relatively small number of bases in the human genome \u2014 330 million, or ",
      " \u2014 gained few mutations in any branch of the mammalian tree, a sign that they were essential to the survival of all of these species, including our own.",
      "Our genes make up a small portion of that 10.7 percent. The rest lies outside our genes, and probably includes elements that turn genes on and off.",
      "Mutations in these little-changed parts of the genome were harmful for millions of years, and they remain harmful to us today, the researchers found. ",
      " typically alter bases that the researchers found had evolved little in the past 100 million years.",
      "Nicky Whiffin, a geneticist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the project, said that clinical geneticists struggle to find disease-causing mutations outside of protein-coding genes.",
      "Dr. Whiffin said the Zoonomia Project could guide geneticists to unexplored regions of the genome with health relevance. \u201cThat could massively narrow down the number of variants you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "The DNA that governs our essential biology has changed remarkably little over the past 100 million years. But of course, we are not identical to kangaroo rats or blue whales. The Zoonomia Project is allowing researchers to pinpoint mutations in the human genome that help make us unique.",
      "Dr. Pollard is focused on thousands of stretches of DNA that have not changed over that period of time \u2014 except in our own species. Intriguingly, many of these pieces of fast-evolving DNA are active in the developing human brain.",
      "Based on the new data, Dr. Pollard and her colleagues think they now understand how our species broke with 100 million years of tradition. In many cases, the first step was a mutation that accidentally created an extra copy of a long stretch of DNA. By making our DNA longer, this mutation ",
      ".",
      "As our DNA refolded, a genetic switch that once controlled a nearby gene no longer made contact with it. Instead, it now made contact with a new one. The switch eventually gained mutations allowing it to control its new neighbor. Dr. Pollard\u2019s research suggests that some of these shifts helped human brain cells grow for a longer period of time during childhood \u2014 a crucial step in the evolution of our large, powerful brains.",
      "Dr. Reilly, of Yale, has found other mutations that might have also helped our species build a more powerful brain: those that accidentally ",
      ".",
      "Scanning the Zoonomia genomes, Dr. Reilly and his colleagues looked for DNA that survived in species after species \u2014 but were then deleted in humans. They found 10,000 of these deletions. Most were just a few bases long, but some of them had profound effects on our species.",
      "One of the most striking deletions altered an off switch in the human genome. It is near a gene called LOXL2, which is active in the developing brain. Our ancestors lost just one base of DNA from the switch. That tiny change turned the off switch into an on switch.",
      "Dr. Reilly and his researchers ran experiments to see how the human version of LOXL2 behaved in neurons compared with the standard mammalian version. Their experiments suggest that LOXL2 stays active in children longer than it does in young apes. LOXL2 is known to keep neurons in a state where they can keep growing and sprouting branches. So staying switched on longer in childhood could allow our brains to grow more than ape brains.",
      "\u201cIt changes our idea of how evolution can work\u201d Dr. Reilly said. \u201cBreaking stuff in your genome can lead to new functions.\u201d",
      "The Zoonomia Project team has plans to add more mammalian genomes to their comparative database. Zhiping Weng, a computational biologist at UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, is particularly eager to look at 250 additional species of primates.",
      " suggests that virus-like pieces of DNA multiplied in the genomes of our monkey-like ancestors, inserting new copies of themselves and rewiring our on-off switches in the process. Comparing more primate genomes will let Dr. Weng get a clearer picture of how those changes may have rewired our genome.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still very obsessed with being a human,\u201d she said."

      " that have barely changed over eons of mammalian evolution and are thus likely to be vital to human health and functioning.",
      "The genetic database they assembled includes the complete genomes of 240 species, covering more than 80 percent of the planet\u2019s mammalian families (and including humans). It could help scientists answer a wide variety of questions about other animals, such as when and how they evolved and the biological basis for some of their unusual talents.",
      "\u201cWhat amazingly cool things can those species do that humans can\u2019t do?\u201d said Elinor Karlsson, a geneticist at UMass Chan Medical School and the Broad Institute and a co-leader of what is known as the ",
      ". \u201cWe always like to think of humans as being the most special species. But it turns out that we\u2019re really quite boring in many ways.\u201d",
      "The Zoonomia data set has limitations. It contains just one genome per species (with the exception of the domestic dog, which was sequenced twice), and thousands of mammals are missing.",
      "But in a new package of papers, published in Science on Thursday, the Zoonomia team showcased the power of this kind of multispecies data. And it\u2019s just the beginning.",
      "\u201cSequencing a lot of genomes is not trivial,\u201d said Michael G. Campana, a computational genomics scientist at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, who was not part of the project. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important is actually making use of these data.\u201d",
      "Here are some of the things that Zoonomia scientists are already doing with it:",
      "To look for the underpinnings of exceptional animal talents, the scientists sought genetic sequences that had evolved unusually quickly in species that shared a certain trait, such as the ability to hibernate.",
      "In ",
      ", the researchers focused on deep hibernators, such as the fat-tailed dwarf lemur and the greater mouse-eared bat, which can maintain low body temperatures for days or weeks at a time. The researchers found evidence of \u201caccelerated evolution\u201d in a variety of genes, including one that is known to help protect cells from temperature-related stress and another that inhibits a cellular pathway related to aging.",
      "\u201cLots of hibernating species also have exceptional longevity,\u201d Dr. Karlsson said, leading her to wonder: Do the changes in that gene contribute to their long lives?",
      "The researchers also explored the mammalian sense of smell. Animals have a large assortment of different olfactory receptors, each capable of binding to certain odor-causing molecules; species with more olfactory receptor genes generally have keener senses of smell.",
      "When the Zoonomia team tallied the number of these genes in each species, the African savanna elephant took the top spot, with 4,199. The nine-banded armadillo and Hoffmann\u2019s two-toed sloth followed, while the Central American agouti came in fourth.",
      "The agouti \u201cturns out to have one of the best olfactory repertoires of any mammal, for totally unknown reasons,\u201d Dr. Karlsson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of how much diversity there is out there that we don\u2019t know anything about.\u201d (Dogs, she noted, did not prove to be \u201cparticularly special\u201d in this regard.)",
      "On the other hand, cetaceans \u2014 a group that includes dolphins and whales \u2014 have a notably small number of olfactory receptor genes, which makes sense given their watery habitats. \u201cThey communicate in other ways,\u201d said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and Uppsala University and the other leader of the Zoonomia Project.",
      "Species with more olfactory receptor genes also tended to have more olfactory turbinals, bony structures in the nasal cavity that aid olfaction. The results suggest that \u201cif certain traits are important, they evolve in multiple ways,\u201d Dr. Lindblad-Toh said.",
      "She added, \u201cI think that one of the important things with our data set is that it generates the genome sequencing for so many different species that people can start looking at their favorite characteristics.\u201d",
      "In February 1925, in the midst of a diphtheria outbreak, a relay of sled dog teams delivered an emergency supply of antitoxin to Nome, Alaska, which had been isolated by snow. Balto, one of the dogs that ran the final leg of the relay, became famous; when he died some years later, his taxidermied body was put on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "A team of Zoonomia researchers has now used a small piece of that taxidermied tissue to ",
      " and his canine contemporaries. \u201cWe saw this as a little challenge,\u201d said Kathleen Morrill, an author of the Balto paper, who performed the research as a graduate student at UMass Chan Medical School and is now a senior scientist at Colossal Biosciences. \u201cHere is this one individual, really famed. We don\u2019t know a lot about his biology. What can we say about his genome?\u201d",
      "Balto, they found, was genetically \u201chealthier\u201d than modern purebred dogs, with more inherited genetic variation and fewer potentially harmful mutations. That finding likely stems from the fact that sled dogs are typically bred for physical performance and may be a mixture of breeds.",
      "Balto also had an assortment of genetic variants that were not present in wolves and were rare or missing in modern purebred dogs, the researchers found. Many variants were in genes involved in tissue development and may have affected a variety of traits important for sled dogs, such as skin thickness and joint formation. Balto had two copies of these variants, one inherited from each parent, which means they were probably at least somewhat common in other Alaskan sled dogs at the time.",
      "\u201cWe get this much clearer picture of what he was like and what his population would have looked like,\u201d said Katie Moon, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an author of the paper. \u201cAnd that picture is of really well-adapted working sled dogs.\u201d",
      "Scientists have long debated precisely how and when today\u2019s diverse assortment of mammals came into being. Did the mammalian family tree branch out only after the extinction of the dinosaurs, some 66 million years ago? Or did the process largely take place before the catastrophe?",
      "A ",
      " suggests that the answer is both. Mammals first began to diversify",
      "about 102 million years ago, when Earth\u2019s continents were fragmenting and sea levels began rising. \u201cThis isolated the predecessors of the modern lineages on different land masses,\u201d said William Murphy, an evolutionary geneticist at Texas A&M University and an author of the paper.",
      "But another burst of diversification came after the extinction of the dinosaurs, the researchers found, when the emergence of new land and the disappearance of the reigning reptiles provided mammals with new habitats, resources and opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really landmark paper,\u201d said Scott Edwards, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, who was not involved in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the largest of its kind in terms of trying to put mammals on a time scale.\u201d",
      "The Zoonomia package more broadly is \u201ca monumental set of work,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really set the standard for our understanding of mammal evolution going forward.\u201d",
      "Mammals generally inherit two copies of most genetic sequences, one from each parent. Determining how closely these sequences match can provide insight into the size of past animal populations; long stretches of matching DNA can be a sign of inbreeding, for instance.",
      "The genome of a single animal reflects \u201chow closely related its parents were, grandparents were, going all the way back,\u201d said Aryn Wilder, a conservation geneticist at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.",
      "Dr. Wilder and her colleagues ",
      " to estimate the population sizes of different species throughout history. Compared with species that were historically abundant, those with small past populations had more potentially harmful genetic mutations and were more likely to be classified as threatened by the ",

The results suggested that the killer whale might be at highest risk.",
      "The approach could provide a quick way to prioritize species for more thorough, resource-intensive risk assessments, said Beth Shapiro, a paleogeneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an author of the study. \u201cIt could be a relatively straightforward way to do conservation triage,\u201d she said."

      "Earlier this year, astronomers announced that a tiny world beyond Neptune with a diameter about one-third that of Earth\u2019s moon possessed a Saturn-like ring that should not be there. It now turns out that there are two such \u201cimpossible\u201d rings.",
      "\u201cIt was a big surprise,\u201d said Chrystian Luciano Pereira, a doctoral student at the National Observatory in Brazil who led the observations of the world, known as Quaoar. \u201cThis implies that Quaoar is a more complex system than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The new ring, about six miles wide, encircles Quaoar at a distance of about 1,500 miles. The discovery ",
      " in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters.",
      "Scientists still do not fully understand how dust and gas in the early solar system coalesced into moons and planets.",
      "Like the ",
      ", announced by a team of astronomers in February, the second ring lies beyond what is known as the Roche limit. Material orbiting closer than this distance tends to be pulled apart by tidal forces. Thus, a ring within the Roche limit would tend to remain a ring, while a ring of debris outside the Roche limit would usually coalesce into a moon.",
      "For Quaoar, the Roche limit is calculated to be 1,100 miles. The second ring, at a distance of 1,500 miles from the center of Quaoar, is closer than the ring announced in February, which has a radius of about 2,500 miles.",
      "Quaoar (pronounced KWA-wahr, and the name of the creator god for the Indigenous Tongva people who live around Los Angeles) orbits the sun in the ",
      " a region of frozen debris beyond Neptune that includes Pluto.",
      "The ring is not visible in telescope images. Rather, astronomers found it indirectly, when distant stars happened to pass behind Quaoar, blocking the starlight. From 2018 to 2021, Quaoar passed in front of four stars, and astronomers on Earth were able to observe the shadow of the eclipses, also known as stellar occultations.",
      "They also observed some dimming of the starlight before and after the star blinked out, which pointed to the existence of the first ring.",
      "Another occultation occurred on Aug. 9 last year, and astronomers again pointed telescopes, large and small, at Quaoar in hopes of learning more about the ring.",
      "The new observations revealed more details including a dense, narrow core in the ring just a few miles wide, which is surrounded by an envelope of material that is more dispersed. The observations also revealed the second ring.",
      "Another occultation will occur on May 13, visible to telescopes in the United States and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis event involves a bright star and will be useful to constrain the Quaoar shape better, in addition to being a good opportunity to obtain more details about these two remarkable rings,\u201d Mr. Pereira said.",
      "A potential explanation for Quaoar\u2019s distant rings is the presence of a moon, Weywot. The moon may have created gravitational disturbances that prevented the ring\u2019s particles from accreting into additional moons. Both rings occur in locations near what are known as resonances with Weywot, and the resonances may turn out to be more important than the Roche limit for determining whether rings turn into moons or remain as rings."

      "Dr. Oh\u2019s work, which includes robot vision and topics in autonomous aviation, often touches on what is known as the sim-to-real gap: how machines trained in a simulated environment can act in the real world. In recent years, Mr. Schaldenbrand has led an effort to bridge the sim-to-real gap between sophisticated image-generation programs like Stable Diffusion and physical works of art like drawings and paintings. This has mainly been manifest in the project known as FRIDA, the latest iteration of which was rhythmically whirring away in a corner of the lab. (FRIDA is an acronym for Framework and Robotics Initiative for Developing Arts, although the researchers chose the acronym, inspired by Frida Kahlo, before deciding what it stood for.)",
      "The process of moving from language prompts to pixelated images to brushstrokes can be complicated, as the robot must account for \u201cthe noise of the real world,\u201d Dr. Oh said. But she, Mr. Schaldenbrand and Jim McCann, a roboticist at Carnegie Mellon who also helped develop FRIDA, believe that the research is worth pursuing for two reasons: It could improve the interface between humans and machines, and it could, through art, help connect people to one another.",
      "\u201cThese models are trained based on everybody\u2019s data,\u201d Dr. McCann said, referring to the large language models that power tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E. \u201cAnd so I still think we\u2019re figuring out how projects like this, that use such models, can deliver value back to people.\u201d",
      "The sim-to-real gap provides a surprisingly tricky problem for roboticists and computer engineers. Some artificial intelligence systems can list the steps involved in walking (tighten your quadriceps and flex your tibialas posterior, tilt your weight back and tense your gluteus maximus) and can make a simulated body walk in a virtual world. So it\u2019s tempting to think that these systems could easily make a physical body walk in the real world.",
      "Not so. In the 1980s, the computer scientist Hans Moravec noted that A.I. was good at engaging in complicated reasoning and parsing vast amounts of data but that it was bad at simple physical activities, like picking up a bottle of water. This is known as Moravec\u2019s paradox. (The physical superiority of humans might be explained by our body\u2019s long evolutionary history; the tasks that are simple for us are supported by millions of years of Darwinian experimentation.)",
      "Painting, which often mixes high-concept ideas and basic physical actions, throws the paradox into relief: How do we manage to capture the absurdity of human consciousness with the motions of an arm?",
      "A.I. image-generating tools like Midjourney, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion are trained by feeding neural networks massive databases of images and corresponding text descriptions. The programmed goal is to model the relationships between the meanings of words and the features of images, and to then use these relationships in a \u201cdiffusion model\u201d to create original images that retain the meaning of particular descriptions. (The prompt \u201cA family picnicking in the park\u201d will generate a new image every time it is used; each one will be understandable as a family picnicking in the park.)",
      "But such images exist only in the sim-world of computers, composed of pixels of varying hue and intensity. Leave the simulation and the image stays behind.",
      "To solve this problem, Dr. Oh and her colleagues took FRIDA\u2019s physicality into account. Taped to a wall in their lab is a piece of paper with 130 different brushstrokes in black: curlicues and lines, some long and straight, some little more than dots. The marks represent the range of the robot\u2019s motion, and they were programmed into its diffusion model.",
      "We take pictures of the brushstrokes, model that interaction, and then get a really accurate simulation of brushstrokes grounded in what the robot can actually do",
      "Mr. Schaldenbrand said. When prompted, the model would create an image of a frog ballerina in pixels, but only in configurations that were possible for the robot to paint using those 130 brushstrokes.",
      "The researchers also developed a way for the robot to occasionally step back from its painting, to gauge how close it was to the goal it had generated in pixels, and to then revise that pixelated goal. A wayward mark could become the motion of the frog ballerina leaping, or the raised eyebrow of someone in her audience. So, every few dozen brushstrokes, FRIDA pulled away from the canvas, took a photo of its work thus far, paused, and then went back to work.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s how maybe human artists do this,\u201d Dr. Oh said. \u201cAdd some brushstrokes, and then go back and look at the full canvas and replan. We wanted to mimic that process.\u201d A process of artistic self-discovery, in a way, albeit a mechanized, algorithmic and statistical one.",
      "The results of these methods are on display in the lab. Portraits of professors, historical figures, landscapes, cityscapes, that frog ballerina, all in a distinctive, abstract style \u2014 even a self-portrait of the first FRIDA robot. The consistency of the paintings suggests a unified artistic vision, for which Mr. Schaldenbrand, Dr. McCann and Dr. Oh decline to claim credit. They attribute each of the works to FRIDA.",
      "But could FRIDA have an oeuvre without a will, a heart or fingernails? Can a robot be an artist?",
      "Amy LaViers, a computer scientist and dancer who runs the Robotics, Automation and Dance Lab, an independent nonprofit, said that such questions wouldn\u2019t seem so crazy, or scary, if people were open to dissolving the hard distinction between the artist and the medium. Everything \u2014 whether it\u2019s watercolor or A.I. image generators or a desire for expressivity \u2014 is wrapped up in the art. Even something as simple as paint can seem to have a mind of its own, and a painter has to react to the way it glides on the canvas. Dr. LaViers suggested viewing FRIDA as a \u201crobotic paintbrush,\u201d rather than a painting robot.",
      "\u201cThere are things you can do with artificial bodies that humans can\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broadens the palette of human expression.\u201d",
      "Dr. Oh emphasized that humans were still essentially involved in FRIDA\u2019s painting. They prompt the machine and mix the paints, set up the canvas and limit the number of total brushstrokes in each piece. The data sets that FRIDA and other image generators are trained on contain paintings and photographs created by other people. But, Dr. Oh added, the goal was never to make something to compete with human artists. \u201cWe want to promote human creativity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want people to express their thoughts in different ways.\u201d",
      "In the lab, Mr. Schaldenbrand watched as a painting slowly emerged from FRIDA\u2019s deliberate gray brushstrokes: a foggy road, the shapes of cars, taillights. \u201cThis is hard to explain,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give some false notion that there\u2019s a consciousness going on here. But it\u2019s kind of fun sometimes to pretend.\u201d"

      "Down the drain is where British archaeologists recently discovered 36 artfully engraved semiprecious stones, in an ancient bathhouse at the site of a Roman fort near Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Carlisle, England. The colorful intaglios \u2014 gems with incised carvings \u2014 likely fell out of signet rings worn by wealthy third-century bathers, and ended up trapped in the stone drains.",
      "The delicate intaglios, fashioned from amethyst, jasper and carnelian, range in diameter from 5 millimeters to 16 millimeters \u2014 bigger than a pencil eraser, smaller than a dime. Some bear images of Apollo, Mars, Bonus Eventus and other Roman deities symbolizing war or good fortune. Others showcase Ceres, the god of fertility, Sol (the sun) and Mercury (commerce). One amethyst depicts Venus holding either a flower or a mirror. A reddish-brown jasper features a satyr seated on rocks beside a pillar.",
      "How and why these stones were lost is a subject of some debate among classicists. After six years of archaeological detective work that has provided a tantalizing glimpse of Roman Britain, Frank Giecco, the technical director of the Carlisle project, believes that he and his team have solved the mystery.",
      "Historically, two kinds of engraved gems were worn mounted on finger rings: intaglios, which have designs cut as a depression into the surface of the gem; and cameos, with designs that project from the background, a raised image in relief.",
      "The tradition of intaglios goes back to the Sumerian period in Mesopotamia, where figures were gouged by hand into softer stone. From about 3400 B.C., stamp seals and cylinder seals were pressed and imprinted into damp clay. These became popular in Minoan and Mycenaean Greece, Persia, Egypt and Rome, where they became objects of fashion; the statesman Cicero observed that people wore portraits of their favorite philosophers on their rings, a tradition that has not survived on today\u2019s QVC Network.",
      "The excavation at the Carlisle Cricket Club began in 2017 and quickly revealed a bathhouse that \u201cwas truly colossal in scale,\u201d Mr. Giecco said.",
      "The bathhouse was built along the river Eden and near the Roman fort of Uxelodunum, also known as Petriana, which was safely situated behind Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the empire\u2019s northern border. Hadrian, the Roman emperor, ordered the wall built in 122 A.D. to ward off Caledonian tribes. At Uxelodunum \u2014 today a thriving suburb \u2014 were stationed the Ala Petriana, a large and elite cavalry regiment. A major civilian settlement \u2014 eventually Luguvalium, or Roman Carlisle \u2014 grew up to the immediate south.",
      "The main building of the bathhouse, constructed around 210 A.D., had sandstone walls three-and-a-half feet thick. The baths were rebuilt in the fourth century and were still in use in the fifth; some parts were subsequently rebuilt in timber and may still have been standing in the 12th century, when the site was quarried for building materials. The region remained strategic. \u201cWe have found evidence of the 1645 and 1745 sieges of Carlisle during the English Civil War and Jacobite Rebellion,\u201d Mr. Giecco said. In the early 20th century the site was turned into tennis courts.",
      "Upon entering the bathhouse in the third century, your first stop was the apodyterium, or changing room, where you removed everything but your bath sandals, needed to protect your feet from the heated floors. Prosperous patrons had slaves to guard their belongings; poorer bathers paid the attendants. Some may have held onto their baubles in the pools to prevent the valuables from being stolen. \u201cBathers knew the risk of gems falling out,\u201d Mr. Giecco said. \u201cBut theft from the lockers was so great that they kept valuables with them regardless.\u201d",
      "If a thief made off with your jewelry, you might call on the gods for justice, by means of a curse tablet: a priest would scrawl a message, sometimes backward or in code, on a slab of lead or other metal, then cast it into the mineral waters. In 1979 and 1980, a large haul of curse tablets was recovered from the hot springs of Aquae Sulis \u2014 now Bath, England \u2014 many of them listing the wrongdoing, the alleged wrongdoers and a suggested punishment. \u201cMay he who carried off Vilbia from me be as liquid as the water,\u201d one curse reads.",
      "The Carlisle gems were found along with more than 700 items, including 105 glass beads, pottery, weapons, coins, clay figures, animal bones, tiles stamped with the imperial mark and some 100 hairpins. Similar discoveries have been made during the excavation of bathhouses in Caesarea, Israel, and in Bath.",
      "The presence of hairpins suggest that the gems\u2019 owners were probably female, Mr. Giecco said. And dips into bathhouse water may have loosened jewelry adhesives, such as birch bark resin, and caused metal settings to expand and contract. In the steamy environment, the Roman elite may have emerged from their leisurely baths unadorned. The stones were likely flushed into the drains when the pools and saunas were cleaned.",
      "\u201cThe bathers may not have even noticed until they got home, because it\u2019s the actual stone falling out of the rings,\u201d Mr. Giecco said."

      "Think of the words whirling around in your head: that tasteless joke you wisely kept to yourself at dinner; your unvoiced impression of your best friend\u2019s new partner. Now imagine that someone could listen in.",
      "On Monday, scientists from the University of Texas, Austin, made another step in that direction. In a study published\u00a0",
      ", the researchers described an A.I. that could translate the private thoughts of human subjects by analyzing fMRI scans,\u00a0which measure the flow of blood to different regions in the brain.",
      "Already, researchers have developed language-decoding methods to ",
      " of people who have lost the ability to speak, and to allow ",
      " while just thinking of writing. But the new language decoder is one of the first to not rely on implants. In the study, it was able to turn a person\u2019s imagined speech into actual speech and, when subjects were shown silent films, it could generate relatively accurate descriptions of what was happening onscreen.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a language stimulus,\u201d said Alexander Huth, a neuroscientist at the university who helped lead the research. \u201cWe\u2019re getting at meaning, something about the idea of what\u2019s happening. And the fact that that\u2019s possible is very exciting.\u201d",
      "The study centered on three participants, who came to Dr. Huth\u2019s lab for 16 hours over several days to listen to \u201cThe Moth\u201d and other narrative podcasts. As they listened, an fMRI scanner recorded the blood oxygenation levels in parts of their brains. The researchers then used a large language model to match patterns in the brain activity to the words and phrases that the participants had heard.",
      "Large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Bard are trained on vast amounts of writing to predict the next word in a sentence or phrase. In the process, the models create maps indicating how words relate to one another. A few years ago, Dr. Huth ",
      " that particular pieces of these maps \u2014 so-called context embeddings, which capture the semantic features, or meanings, of phrases \u2014 could be used to predict how the brain lights up in response to language.",
      "In a basic sense, said Shinji Nishimoto, a neuroscientist at Osaka University who was not involved in the research, \u201cbrain activity is a kind of encrypted signal, and language models provide ways to decipher it.\u201d",
      "In their study, Dr. Huth and his colleagues effectively reversed the process, using another A.I. to translate the participant\u2019s fMRI images into words and phrases. The researchers tested the decoder by having the participants listen to new recordings, then seeing how closely the translation matched the actual transcript.",
      "Almost every word was out of place in the decoded script, but the meaning of the passage was regularly preserved. Essentially, the decoders were paraphrasing.",
      ": \u201cI got up from the air mattress and pressed my face against the glass of the bedroom window expecting to see eyes staring back at me but instead only finding darkness.\u201d",
      " \u201cI just continued to walk up to the window and open the glass I stood on my toes and peered out I didn\u2019t see anything and looked up again I saw nothing.\u201d",
      "While under the fMRI scan, the participants were also asked to silently imagine telling a story; afterward, they repeated the story aloud, for reference. Here, too, the decoding model captured the gist of the unspoken version.",
      ": \u201cLook for a message from my wife saying that she had changed her mind and that she was coming back.\u201d",
      ": \u201cTo see her for some reason I thought she would come to me and say she misses me.\u201d",
      "Finally the subjects watched a brief, silent animated movie, again while undergoing an fMRI scan. By analyzing their brain activity, the language model could decode a rough synopsis of what they were viewing \u2014 maybe their internal description of what they were viewing.",
      "The result suggests that the A.I. decoder was capturing not just words but also meaning. \u201cLanguage perception is an externally driven process, while imagination is an active internal process,\u201d Dr. Nishimoto said. \u201cAnd the authors showed that the brain uses common representations across these processes.\u201d",
      "Greta Tuckute, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research, said that was \u201cthe high-level question.\u201d",
      "\u201cCan we decode meaning from the brain?\u201d she continued. \u201cIn some ways they show that, yes, we can.\u201d",
      "This language-decoding method had limitations, Dr. Huth and his colleagues noted. For one, fMRI scanners are bulky and expensive. Moreover, training the model is a long, tedious process, and to be effective it must be done on individuals. When the researchers tried to use a decoder trained on one person to read the brain activity of another, it failed, suggesting that every brain has unique ways of representing meaning.",
      "Participants were also able to shield their internal monologues, throwing off the decoder by thinking of other things. A.I. might be able to read our minds, but for now it will have to read them one at a time, and with our permission."

      "When I heard that statement during a showing of the film recently, it broke my heart. It was the saddest, loneliest idea I had ever contemplated. I thought I was aware and knowledgeable about our shared cosmic predicament \u2014 namely, that if what we think we know about physics and cosmology is true, life and intelligence are doomed. I thought I had made some kind of intellectual peace with that.",
      "But this was an angle that I hadn\u2019t thought of before. At some point in the future there will be somewhere in the universe where there will be a last sentient being. And a last thought. And that last word, no matter how profound or mundane, will vanish into silence along with the memory of Einstein and Elvis, Jesus, Buddha, Aretha and Eve, while the remaining bits of the physical universe go on sailing apart for billions upon billions upon billions of lonely, silent years.",
      "Will that last thought be a profound pearl of wisdom? An expletive?",
      "How did we humans get into this fix? The universe as we know it originated in a fiery burst 13.8 billion years ago and has been flying apart ever since. Astronomers argued for decades about whether it would go on expanding forever or someday collapse again into a \u201cbig crunch.\u201d",
      "All that changed in 1998 when astronomers discovered that the cosmic expansion was speeding up, boosted by an anti-gravitational force that is part of the fabric of spacetime. The bigger the universe gets, the harder this \u201cdark energy\u201d pushes it apart. This new force bears a striking resemblance to the cosmological constant, a cosmic repulsion Einstein had proposed as a fudge factor in his equations as a way of explaining why the universe did not collapse, but later rejected as a blunder.",
      "But the cosmological constant ",

      "In the end, if this dark energy prevails, distant galaxies will eventually be speeding away so fast that we can\u2019t see them anymore. The more time goes on, the less we will know about the universe. The stars will die and not be reborn. It will be like living inside an inside-out black hole, sucking matter, energy and information over the horizon, never to return.",
      "Worse, because thinking takes energy, eventually there will not be enough energy in the universe to hold a thought. In the end there will only be subatomic particles dancing intergalactic distances away from each other in a dark silence, trillions upon trillions of years after there was any light or life in the universe. And then, more uncountable trillions of eons to come, until there is finally no way to count the years, as Brian Greene, the popular Columbia University theorist and author, so elegantly and devastatingly described it in his recent book, \u201cUntil the End of Time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard not to want to scream at our own insignificance in all of this. If this is, in fact, what the universe will come to. The universe as we know it is now 14 billion years old, which seems like a long time but is only an infinitesimal sliver of the trillions and quadrillions of years of darkness to come. It will mean that everything interesting in our universe happened in a brief flash, at the very beginning. A promising start, and then an eternal abyss. The finality and futility of it all!",
      "In short, a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. What do we do with a universe like this?",
      "You may point out that it is way too soon to be prescribing a future for the universe. New discoveries in physics could provide an escape hatch. Maybe dark energy will not be constant; maybe it will turn around and recompress the universe. In an email, Michael Turner, the cosmologist emeritus formerly at the University of Chicago who coined the term dark energy, referring to the Greek letter symbolizing Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant said, \u201cLambda would be the most uninteresting answer to the dark energy puzzle!\u201d",

      "And black holes will finally release all that they have imprisoned as a thin spray of particles and radiation, to be scattered into the prevailing wind of dark energy whisking them apart.",
      "In some variations on the story, known as the Big Rip, dark energy could eventually grow strong enough to tear apart the tombstones that mark your grave.",
      "And so, just as there was a first living creature somewhere, sometime, to emerge from the splendid blaze of the Big Bang, there will be a last creature to die, a last thought. A last sentient being, as Dr. Levin pointed out.",
      "That idea is what stopped me short. It had never occurred to me that some individual being would have the last word on existence, the last chance to curse or be grateful. Part of the pain is that nobody will know who, or what, had the last word, or what was thought or said. Somehow that notion made cosmic extinction more personal, and I wondered what it would be like.",
      "Maybe as all the energy dwindles away over the horizon it will be like falling asleep. Or like Einstein mumbling his last words in German to a nurse who didn\u2019t know the language. Or the computer at the end of time in Isaac Asimov\u2019s classic story ",
      " finally figuring out the secret of the universe and declaring, \u201cLet there be light.\u201d Might it be some blazing realization about the nature of string theory or the final secret about black holes? I hate to miss out on it.",
      "I\u2019d like to think my last thought would be one of love or gratitude or awe or about the face of a loved one, but I worry it would be an expletive.",
      "Wiser people than me ask, when I go on about this, why I don\u2019t whine about the billions of years that passed before I was born? Perhaps it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know what I was missing, whereas now I\u2019ve had a lifetime to imagine what I\u2019ll miss.",
      "If that worries you, here is an encouraging metaphor straight from Einstein\u2019s equations: When you are inside a black hole, light pours in from the outside universe, which seems to speed up while you appear to be frozen. In principle, you could see the whole future history of the galaxy or even the whole universe speed past you as you fall toward the center, the singularity where space and time stop, and you die.",
      "Maybe death could be like that, a revelation of all of the past and future.",
      "In a sense, when we die the future dies too.",
      "Rather than whine about the end of time, most of the physicists and astronomers I talk to say the notion is a relief. The death of the future frees them to concentrate on the magic of the moment.",
      "The late, great astrophysicist, philosopher and black hole evangelist John Archibald Wheeler, of Princeton, used to say that the past and the future are fiction, that they only exist in the artifacts and the imaginations of the present.",
      "According to that point of view, the universe ends with me, and so in a sense I do have the final word.",
      "\u201cNothing lasts forever\u201d is a maxim that applies to the stock market and the stars as well as to our lives and Buddhist sand paintings. A whiff of eternity can illuminate an entire lifetime, perhaps even mine.",
      "No matter what happens in the endless eons to come, at least we were here for the party, for the brief shining sliver of eternity when the universe teemed with life and light.",

      "When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city\u2019s most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.",

But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city's center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.",
      "In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco\u2019s continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco\u2019s downtown remains at roughly a third of prepandemic levels \u2014 lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to ",

      "The impact on the city\u2019s budget is significant, too: Office-based industries account for nearly three quarters of the city\u2019s gross domestic product. After years of surpluses, the government now forecasts a $780 million deficit in the upcoming two fiscal years \u2014 roughly a 6 percent cut in its general fund, according to the mayor\u2019s office.",
      "City officials say they are searching for ways to diversify the economy and to reduce homelessness and drug dealing. They realize that some of the largest local employers, Big Tech companies, will not be towing San Francisco from its economic shoals. Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.",

It has always been a constellation\u00a0of very different neighborhoods, some of which have very few of the social ills that afflict the area near the closed Whole Foods.",
      "Officials add that\u00a0the downtown may ultimately emerge more resilient if it attracts industries like life sciences and bio-tech whose employees still need work space.

      "Mr. Preston uses his district as an example of how uneven the pandemic recovery has been. Some areas like Japantown and Haight Ashbury are thriving, he said. Others like the Tenderloin, which is adjacent to the shuttered Whole Foods, are beset by drug dealing and homelessness.",
      "One of the next big tests for downtown might be this summer\u2019s expected opening of an Ikea store not far from the Whole Foods site.",

      "In a nod to the ongoing risk the coronavirus poses to millions of Americans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Wednesday that adults 65 and older and those with weakened immune systems receive another dose of the reformulated booster that debuted last fall.",
      "The endorsement followed a daylong discussion by the C.D.C.\u2019s expert advisers. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the booster plan on Tuesday, and the C.D.C.\u2019s recommendation was the final administrative step. Eligible Americans will be able to receive booster doses immediately.",
      "Federal health officials are also phasing out the original vaccine formulas created by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, revoking their authorizations in the United States. And instead of needing an initial series of two shots, unvaccinated people will now require just a single dose of the reformulated, or \u201cbivalent,\u201d Covid shot to be considered vaccinated.",
      "Until now, federal officials had required two doses of the older vaccine before recipients could begin to receive the bivalent boosters, a process some experts felt was confusing.",
      "Limited data on the reformulated vaccines indicate that in older adults, the shots offer ",
      " against severe disease and death from Covid, although the protection wanes rapidly in the weeks after inoculation.",
      "There are about ",
      " adults 65 and older in the United States, accounting for about 16 percent of the population, according to the Census Bureau. And ",
      " Americans have weak immune systems because of an illness or a medication.",
      "Roughly 250 people in the United States are ",
      " from Covid-related causes each day, a vast majority of whom are over 70 or have impaired immune systems. The median age of those hospitalized is 75, according to the C.D.C. Yet only about 43 percent of adults 65 and older have received a bivalent booster shot so far.",
      "By this point, most Americans have built up some immunity against the virus, whether through prior infections, vaccinations or both. The new guidelines acknowledge as much, but allow for those still at high risk from the virus to protect themselves, and to do so free of charge.",
      "\u201cThe one-size-fits-all policy was simple but not optimal,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician and health policy expert at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe new regimen acknowledges that there\u2019s now an extraordinary spectrum of Covid risk, from mild to massive, depending on who you are.\u201d",
      "People who are severely immunocompromised, such as organ transplant recipients, may want to opt for booster shots every six months or even more frequently, Dr. Faust said.",
      "The new guidelines come weeks after ",
      " and ",
      " recommended additional shots for older adults and immunocompromised people, among others. ",
      "The C.D.C. now says that adults 65 and older may opt for another dose of the bivalent vaccine at least four months after their first shot. Those with weakened immune systems may do so two months after their previous bivalent dose, and may choose to receive more doses in consultation with their health care provider.",
      "In the meeting of C.D.C. advisers on Wednesday, Dr. Camille Kotton, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, noted that the new recommendations did not include immunocompromised children 6 months through 4 years of age. That leaves those medically frail children \u2014 including recipients of organ transplants \u2014 unprotected against the virus, she said.",
      "\u201cAs a mom and doctor, this seems like we are leaving them so vulnerable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "For most Americans, the F.D.A. plans to encourage annual Covid shots in the fall, much as it does with flu shots. Health officials will decide on the exact composition of the shot in June, based on the version of the virus circulating at the time.",
      "The bivalent vaccine targets the original variant of the coronavirus as well as variants BA.4 and BA.5, which were dominant last summer. But BA.4 and BA.5 were quickly supplanted by newer versions.",
      "The most recent Omicron subvariant, ",

      "Federal health officials also are making changes to the process for those receiving the initial shots.",
      "Unvaccinated people will receive a single dose of the bivalent vaccine, rather than multiple doses of the original monovalent vaccine. The rationale is that most unvaccinated Americans now presumably have some measure of immunity from a prior infection and may not need two doses at the beginning, the F.D.A. said.",
      "Some experts were sharply critical of the advice. Reams of data suggest that the vaccines are most protective when given in two doses and followed by one or more boosters to reinforce the shield, said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College.",
      "\u201cF.D.A. has consistently over-interpreted the performance of the bivalent formulation when given as a booster,\u201d Dr. Moore said. \u201cNow it seems to have gone beyond the science and decided it has some kind of magic power as a first dose.\u201d",
      "It may be reasonable to assume that nearly all unvaccinated adults have already been infected at least once and can get by with just a single dose, said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.",
      "\u201cI guess the F.D.A. is just trying to simplify given the reality on the ground,\u201d he said. But \u201cimmunologically, you\u2019d want to get two shots if it\u2019s your first exposure.\u201d",
      "The agency could instead recommend two doses of a bivalent vaccine and say that those who know of a prior infection can elect to forego the second dose, Dr. Bhattacharya said. But, he added, \u201cin reality, I doubt a clause like that would make much practical difference.\u201d",
      "The F.D.A. said it had \u201ccarefully reviewed the available epidemiologic evidence, scientific publications and data provided by sponsors indicating that a single bivalent vaccine dose provided to individuals previously infected with Covid-19 provides an immune response equal to, or superior to, two doses of the original vaccine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe agency believes that this approach will help encourage future vaccination, particularly among those who have not chosen to be vaccinated to date,\u201d the F.D.A. said in its statement."

The New York Times spoke with epidemiologists and infectious disease experts to gauge how they\u2019re thinking about this particular juncture in the pandemic \u2014 what the risk is right now, what precautions they\u2019re continuing to take, who is still getting severely ill and dying, and what the future may bring.",

That sensation is most likely pain associated with ovulation, or, as it\u2019s known in the medical world, mittelschmerz (the German term for \u201cmiddle pain\u201d).",
      "It\u2019s difficult to pin down just how prevalent ovulation pain is because, in most cases, it\u2019s so mild that women don\u2019t report it, said Dr. Jenna Turocy, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University. Some estimates suggest as many as ",

      "Ovulation is a fairly complex process, said Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg, vice president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School. It involves one follicle (a fluid-filled sac in the ovary that carries a single egg) growing drastically in size, from less than ",

      ", which measured hormone levels and follicle size, found that women reported pain before the egg had emerged, suggesting that the pain might be a \u201cpre-ovulatory event.\u201d One explanation is that the expansion of the follicle can lead to some cramping, Dr. Ginsburg said.",
      "There are two other potential culprits, said Dr. Aparna Sridhar, an OB-GYN at U.C.L.A. Health: luteinizing hormone, called LH, which triggers follicle rupture, and ",
      ", which are hormone-like substances that spur muscle contractions (and thus, sometimes pain), including in surrounding muscles like the bowels. The surge in LH invites a surge in prostaglandins, she said.",
      "Teenagers who have just started menstruating, for example, tend not to feel ovulatory pain, Dr. Sridhar said. That\u2019s most likely because, though their follicles expand, they don\u2019t ovulate at that point in their lives and therefore don\u2019t have high levels of LH or prostaglandins.",
      "Ovulation pain should not be debilitating, and severe pain that hasn\u2019t subsided after 24 hours is a sign of a larger problem, Dr. Breitkopf said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that when people come in for this, it\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s pretty bad and it\u2019s affecting their life,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s bad enough that they may have to take time off work.\u201d",
      "In some cases, for example, the pain might be indicative of ",
      " from the ruptured follicle, which might require surgery. Women with endometriosis or those who have had previous surgery that scarred their ovaries tend to feel more acute pain around ovulation.",
      "Experts say that the medicine and treatment that help with period cramps should also help manage most cases of mild ovulation pain, like over-the-counter pain medications. \u201cA heat pack can be helpful too,\u201d Dr. Turocy said.",
      "For those who aren\u2019t trying to get pregnant and for whom the pain gets in the way of day-to-day activities, hormonal birth control is another option because it tends to stop ovulation altogether, Dr. Sridhar said. \u201cThat can make life easier.\u201d"

      "Menopause costs American women an estimated $1.8 billion in lost working time per year, according to ",
      " published this week. The paper examined how hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and the myriad other symptoms associated with this time of life affect women in the workplace. It\u2019s the largest study of its kind to have been done in the United States.",
      "Researchers surveyed more than 4,000 participants at four Mayo Clinic sites in Minnesota, Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin. Roughly 15 percent said they had either missed work or cut back on hours because of their menopause symptoms, which the study classified as \u201cadverse work outcomes.\u201d Those who reported the very worst symptoms were 16 times more likely to report such outcomes than those with the least severe symptoms. A little over 1 percent said that their symptoms had become so debilitating that they either quit their jobs or were laid off in the preceding six months.",
      "\u201cWe took that data and extrapolated it based on the work force in the U.S., and that\u2019s how we arrived at the estimated annual loss,\u201d said Dr. Juliana Kling, a co-author of the study and chair of the Women\u2019s Health Internal Medicine division at Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. There are, according to U.S. census data, more than 15 million women ages 45 to 60 in the workplace.",
      "Though a majority of survey participants were white, the researchers found that menopause can have a greater effect on Black and Hispanic working women, Dr. Kling said. \u201cBlack women tended to have more menopausal symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd higher percentages of Black women and Hispanic women reported adverse work outcomes related to menopausal symptoms compared to white women.\u201d",
      "Several other ",
      " have arrived at conclusions similar to those of the Mayo Clinic study. A smaller survey by the corporate health benefits provider ",
      " found that roughly 20 percent of women took time off from work because of menopause. Researchers at ",
      " in England analyzed data from a longitudinal study of over 3,000 women and found that those who reported at least one disruptive menopausal symptom at the age of 50 were 43 percent more likely to have left their jobs by the age of 55.",
      "The findings underscore the physical, economic and social challenges women face as they age, enduring sometimes debilitating physical changes while navigating the discomfort of discussing menopause with younger or male colleagues, said Dr. Ekta Kapoor, a co-author of the study and an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. \u201cThe topic of menopause is taboo in general but even more so at the workplace,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from women that they don\u2019t want to come across as a \u2018complainer\u2019 at work or they\u2019ll bring up menopause and people will roll their eyes.\u201d This, Dr. Kapoor added, can exacerbate the psychological challenges.",
      "The economic loss calculated by the Mayo Clinic study is likely an underestimate, Dr. Kapoor said, because the women surveyed have access to health insurance and potential treatments for their symptoms, which is not the case for many Americans.",
      "The findings \u201caffirm what patients tell me,\u201d said Dr. Makeba Williams, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. (Dr. Williams was not involved with the research.) One of her patients, for example, is a university professor who was so troubled by the brain fog she had during the transition to menopause that she decided to stop teaching advanced level courses, Dr. Williams said. \u201cHer symptoms had gotten so bad, she could not find the next word when lecturing. That story can come in many different versions. Women see in their day-to-day lives that their productivity is impacted.\u201d",
      "But most Americans don\u2019t have the ability to choose to cut back on work the way some women in the study did, Dr. Williams said. \u201cMany women don\u2019t have the privilege of saying I\u2019m just not going to teach this course \u2014 because maybe if you don\u2019t show up, you will not have a job, and that has economic and personal financial impact too.\u201d",
      "Two years ago, when Grace Ward was a 44-year-old supervisor at a local library in Kalamazoo, Mich., she started getting intense migraines for the first time in her life \u2014 a symptom, she later realized, of perimenopause, the transition to menopause.",
      "\u201cFor two to three days a month, I had to keep my head down. The sensitivity to light was just obnoxious,\u201d she said. She also experienced \u201cwild\u201d mood swings and hot flashes that kept her awake at night and she began menstruating twice a month \u2014 all of which made her \u201cmarkedly tired.\u201d",
      "Ms. Ward used up her sick days to take time off work and eventually \u201cmy managers were starting to question whether I was still up to it.\u201d That\u2019s when she decided to resign.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be better to leave than be fired,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible that we \u2014 as women \u2014 have to work through this craziness. I routinely feel bad for us.\u201d"

      "More than 75 members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine demanded on Thursday that the organization explain why it has for years failed to return or repurpose millions of dollars donated by the Sackler family, including some who led Purdue Pharma.",
      "The company\u2019s drug, OxyContin, helped set in motion a prescription opioid crisis that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The New York Times reported this month that even as the Academies advised the government on opioid policy, the organization ",
      " and appointed influential members to its committees who had financial ties to Purdue Pharma.",
      "One report issued by the Academies claimed that 100 million, or 40 percent of Americans, were in chronic pain. The figure, later found to be inflated, was cited by drugmakers to convince doctors to write large numbers of opioid prescriptions.",
      "In a letter delivered to Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academies of Sciences, scientists and economists called on the organization to clarify how research committee members who ran nonprofits heavily funded by Purdue were chosen to provide guidance to federal authorities on opioid policy: \u201cHow did the system fail in the past?\u201d the letter asked.",
      "\u201cThe academy was looking like it had been morally asleep for the last 30 years,\u201d Robert Putnam, an author of the letter and Harvard public policy professor, said in an interview.",
      "\u201cWe of course take the concerns of National Academy of Sciences members seriously, and their concerns were in part what prompted very serious conversations here about returning or repurposing the funds, to which the N.A.S. remains committed,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Friday.",
      "The National Academies was chartered in 1863 by Abraham Lincoln to advise the nation on scientific and medical questions. The institution elects new members each year \u2014 elite scientists and physicians \u2014 and delivers influential advice to the White House, Congress and federal agencies.",
      "Though about 70 percent of the National Academies budget comes from federal funds, it also raises private donations from individuals, nonprofits and companies, including Chevron, Google, Merck and Medtronic.",
      "\u201cIf they begin to see the problem \u2014 that is, this huge influx of private money, and private money often comes with implicit strings \u2014 they will see it\u2019s a threat to the core principles of the Academies,\u201d Dr. Putnam said of the National Academies\u2019 current leadership.",
      "Signatories of the letter include eight Nobel Prize winners. Two authors are National Academies of Sciences members who in 2017 urged top officials to distance the organization from the Sacklers.",
      "Robert M. Hauser, a prominent social scientist, wrote in an October 2017 email to two top Academies officials: \u201cI have been thinking about the willingness of the N.A.S. to accept support from the Sackler family and to produce events and awards \u2014 lectures, forums, colloquia, prizes \u2014 however meritorious, in their name.\u201d",
      "He and another Academies member had concluded \u201cthat the N.A.S. should disassociate itself from the Sacklers.\u201d The other member was Angus Deaton, a Nobel Laureate and co-author of a book about surging deaths tied to substance use and suicide among members of the white working class.",
      "Dr. Deaton said in an interview that he and Dr. Hauser had asked for a call with top officials about the Sacklers\u2019 involvement.",
      "\u201cWe wanted more than anything to warn them that there was a lot of trouble ahead down this route, and that tens of thousands of people were dying and the Sacklers were giving them money,\u201d Dr. Deaton recalled in an interview.",
      "Dr. Hauser, who worked at the National Academies from 2010 to 2016, referenced an in-depth ",
      " about the Sackler family\u2019s \u201cruthless\u201d marketing of OxyContin in the email, which was sent to Bruce Darling, then the executive officer, and James Hinchman, then the chief operating officer.",
      "\u201cSooner or later I thought this was going to blow up in their faces,\u201d Dr. Hauser said in an interview. \u201cAnd it would really besmirch the reputation of the Academies, which I felt strongly about defending.\u201d",
      "Four minutes after Dr. Hauser\u2019s initial request was emailed, he received a reply from Mr. Darling: \u201cWe had a conversation at the N.A.S. Council this past summer on the very issue that you raise, and we made a decision that I would be pleased to discuss with you.\u201d",
      "Mr. Darling and Mr. Hinchman did not respond to messages requesting comment.",
      "Dr. Hauser recalled that Mr. Darling summarized the Sacklers\u2019 donations as something that had been discussed and required no new action. Dr. Deaton and Dr. Hauser felt their concerns had been dismissed.",
      "Two National Academies reports on opioids have faced criticism from experts. One published in 2011 included two panelists with significant financial ties to Purdue and concluded that 100 million Americans were in chronic pain, a number that proved to be greatly inflated. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later estimated that roughly 52 million adults suffered from chronic pain, and more than 17 million U.S. adults experience high-impact or more severe chronic pain.)",
      "Still, the report armed drug companies with a talking point that ",
      " with Food and Drug Administration officials who oversaw opioid approvals. It was also ",
      " in their response to a Senate inquiry.",
      "Another Academies committee on opioid policy was ",
      " by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, because of some members\u2019 links to Purdue. That panel, formed in 2016, went forward with a study after four members were replaced.",
      "Articles in ",
      " and in ",
      " ",
      ", or the British Medical Journal, have also noted the Sacklers\u2019 ties to the Academies and identified additional committee members with links to Purdue.",
      "The letter on Friday asked for \u201cclear answers\u201d to what procedures are in place to \u201censure that advisory committee members are properly vetted,\u201d among other questions.",
      "The Academies told The Times that beginning in 2019 Sackler family donations were no longer used for science-related events, research and awards, the purposes for which they were intended. The funds \u201cwere never used to support any advisory activities on the use of opioids,\u201d Megan Lowry, a spokeswoman, said.",
      "The donations amounted to roughly $19 million and, as invested funds in the institution\u2019s endowment, were worth about $31 million in late 2021, the most recent accounting available. Universities that accepted Sackler funds, including Tufts and Brown, have reallocated some of the money to addiction prevention and treatment efforts.",
      "Members of the Sackler family who were active in running Purdue Pharma began donating in 2008 to the National Academies of Sciences. The money was used to sponsor forums and studies.",
      "In 2015, family members ",
      ", according to reports by the organization\u2019s treasurer. Dr. and Ms. Sackler died in 2017 and 2019. An attorney for the family said those donations had \u201cnothing at all to do with pain, medications or anything related to the company.\u201d",
      "Dame Jillian Sackler, whose husband, Arthur, died years before OxyContin arrived on the market, began giving to the Academies in 2000, and donated $5 million by 2017, Academies reports show.",
      "A day after The Times\u2019s report ran, the National Academies ",
      " saying it had explored returning or repurposing the funds. \u201cDoing so in an ethical and transparent manner will be the most important consideration,\u201d the organization said.",
      "A perceived lack of urgency in the statement helped prompt the new letter from Academies members. \u201cIt\u2019s another brushoff the way we read it,\u201d Dr. Hauser said.",
      "He added: \u201cWe wrote our letter to tell them, \u2018You guys have to be serious, prompt and sufficient about this.\u2019\u201d"

      "Kaiser Permanente, a large California-based health care group with 39 hospitals and 24,000 doctors, said on Wednesday that it expected to acquire Geisinger Health, a smaller East Coast group, in an effort to develop a new company that would operate nonprofit community health systems.",
      "\u201cIf we can take much of what is in our value-based care platform and extend that to these leading community health systems, then we extend our mission,\u201d Greg A. Adams, Kaiser\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cWe reach more people, we drive greater affordability for health care in this country.\u201d Both organizations are nonprofit.",
      "Kaiser will not absorb Geisinger, which will keep its name. Instead, Geisinger, which is headquartered in Danville, Pa., will be folded into Risant Health, a new nonprofit group that will operate independently. Geisinger\u2019s chief executive, Dr. Jaewon Ryu, will serve as Risant\u2019s chief executive when the deal is closed.",
      "Federal and state regulators must approve the deal. While Mr. Adams did not say what other health systems he might be talking to regarding acquisitions, Kaiser said it hoped to invest $5 billion in Risant over the next five years, in addition to its spending on Kaiser\u2019s core operations. The company expects to add five or six health systems to Risant in that time.",
      "Kaiser, which serves 13 million people in eight states and the District of Columbia, has built a reputation for delivering high-quality care at low costs. The organization operates like a health maintenance organization, in which it is paid a fixed sum to care for someone through a closed network of hospitals and doctors. But it has not succeeded in offering its model broadly across the country.",
      "The creation of Risant Health represents an opportunity for Kaiser, which had $95 billion in revenue last year, to become an even bigger and more influential organization by working with other hospital groups and health plans.",
      "The formation of the company is also a response to the rapid changes taking place in the health care industry. Large for-profit companies like health insurers, pharmacy chains and other corporations are scooping up physician practices and urgent care centers and devouring more of the country\u2019s health care dollars.",
      "In keeping with Kaiser\u2019s model, the community health systems under Risant would invest in technology and preventive care to keep patients healthy, so they would need less expensive specialty and hospital care, Mr. Adams said.",
      "As national systems and new players grow larger, \u201cthey are pulling away in some respects from our communities and from our community health systems,\u201d he said.",
      "The new venture \u201cis a way to really ensure that not-for-profit, value-based community health is not only alive but is thriving in this country,\u201d Mr. Adams added.",
      "As hospital groups emerge from the pandemic, many are struggling with higher expenses for supplies and labor. Both Kaiser and Geisinger reported operating losses in 2022.",
      "\u201cCovid has really shown not having integrated, value-based relationships puts our health systems and our communities at risk,\u201d Mr. Adams said.",
      "While Geisinger has long focused on improving care, Dr. Ryu said the health system would benefit from Kaiser\u2019s ability to invest in the kind of technology and preventive care necessary to keep people healthier. \u201cThis model made sense to us as a way to accelerate and further bolster those capabilities and bring better health into our communities,\u201d he said.",
      "Because it has specialized in providing care under arrangements where it is paid a fixed amount, Kaiser has become one of the largest insurers in the profitable Medicare Advantage market, where its private plans are sold as an alternative to traditional Medicare.",
      "But Kaiser has not been immune to criticism for ",
      " the federal government, and some people say its financial model means it can be slow to refer patients for costly services. Kaiser has defended its billing practices and says its doctors work with patients to provide the most appropriate care."

      "An old tuberculosis vaccine known to bolster the immune system did not prevent Covid infections among health care workers, scientists reported on Thursday.",
      "But the trial was shorter and smaller than originally designed, and the investigators said that the results did not rule out other potential benefits associated with the vaccine, known as B.C.G. for bacille Calmette-Guerin.",
      "The ",
      " was the largest clinical trial of the vaccine\u2019s potential to protect against Covid infections. B.C.G. was developed in the early 1900s to combat TB, but has since also been shown to confer protection against other illnesses, including respiratory diseases.",
      "The trial of health care workers began in March 2020, during the early days of the pandemic, when no effective treatments for Covid were available and a new vaccine against the highly infectious disease seemed to be a remote fantasy. The hope was that the old vaccine might be repurposed to save lives.",
      "Six months after vaccination with B.C.G., however, there were no significant differences between the two groups of health care workers: While 14.7 percent of those inoculated with B.C.G. developed symptomatic Covid infections, 12.3 percent of those who received saline placebo shots got sick.",
      "Five participants in each group were hospitalized, and one participant who got the placebo died. The differences were not statistically significant.",
      "The remarkably rapid development of mRNA vaccines made it impossible to complete the B.C.G. trial as designed because health care workers were first in line to get the newly available mRNA shots.",
      "The goal of the B.C.G. trial had been to follow 10,000 participants from five countries \u2014 Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, Britain and Brazil \u2014 for 12 months, but the new paper reports on only 4,000 adults who were followed for six months.",
      "The mRNA vaccines were \u201can absolute miracle of modern science,\u201d said Dr. Nigel Curtis, the trial\u2019s chief investigator, who is a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Melbourne in Australia. \u201cBut from the trial\u2019s point of view, it was fairly disastrous.\u201d",
      "A still larger trial would have been required to see whether the vaccine protected against not just infections but also hospitalizations and deaths from Covid.",
      "The vaccine is still widely used in the developing world, where many babies die before their first birthdays. Scientists have found that B.C.G. inoculation reduces infant mortality. In addition to protecting babies from tuberculosis, the vaccine appears to train the immune system to respond to other pathogens, and reduces rates of respiratory illnesses and other diseases.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of our trial \u2014 that B.C.G. does not protect health care workers against mild or moderate Covid \u2014 is true,\u201d Dr. Curtis said.",
      "But it may still hold promise, he added: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the ability to protect people in other age groups against infections. B.C.G. is still a very important concept in infants.\u201d",
      "Additional analysis of the data collected from inoculated health care workers is continuing. The vaccine\u2019s effects may vary depending on the virus or bacterium it is pitted against, Dr. Curtis said.",
      "The B.C.G. vaccine contains live modified bacteria that have been cultivated in labs around the world for decades, introducing mutations that have led to a number of strains. Differing strains of B.C.G. and varying inoculation regimens may account for inconsistent results in other studies, some experts say.",
      "One of the most successful so far has been a ",
      " who received multiple B.C.G. inoculations before the pandemic in an effort to improve their blood sugar levels and to reduce infections.",
      "That study found that those who received B.C.G. had far fewer Covid infections than participants who got placebo shots."

From 2011 to 2020, the figure rose from 4.8 million to 7.5 million, the team found, a period in which the overall number of pediatric E.R. visits fell. In effect, the proportion of E.R. visits for mental health-related issues roughly doubled, from 7.7 percent to 13.1 percent.",
      "The number of visits rose for many conditions, including mood and behavioral disorders, substance use and psychosis. But the increase in suicide-related issues was most pronounced, increasing to 4.2 percent of all pediatric emergency room visits in 2020 from 0.9 percent in 2011.",

      "A single dose of the human papillomavirus vaccine is highly effective at preventing infections over three years, most likely lowering rates of cervical cancer and other diseases linked to the virus, according to a new study in Kenya.",
      "A single-dose strategy would dramatically extend supplies of the vaccine, lower costs and simplify distribution, which would make vaccination a more viable option in countries with limited resources, experts said.",
      "HPV is a sexually transmitted infection linked to cervical cancer and other malignancies. Health officials in many countries, ",
      ", recommend two doses of the vaccine for adolescent girls younger than 15, and three doses for those who are older.",
      "But observational data has long suggested that a single dose offers effective protection against HPV for at least a decade. The new results are the first confirmation from a gold-standard clinical trial that a single dose may be as effective as two or three doses, at least over three years.",
      "Results of a direct comparison of one- and two-dose regimens will not be available until 2025.",
      "At least 24 countries, including Mexico, Tonga and Guyana, have shifted to the one-dose approach, according to the World Health Organization. ",

But high-income countries like Britain and Australia were among the first to change their policies, he noted.",

      "The scientists collected cervical and vaginal swabs from the women every six months and looked for persistent HPV infection up to 36 months.",
      "The vaccine had an efficacy of 98 percent against the virus subtypes 16 and 18 over three years, and 96 percent against all cancer-causing strains, the study found. No serious side effects were reported.",
      "Earlier results from the study, ",
      ", showed that a single dose of both vaccines was highly effective for 18 months.",

      "Programs funded by Gavi have so far reached only about one-third of their goal, in part because of a shortage in vaccine supply. Roughly 20 million doses were available in 2022, Dr. Berkley said, but that number is expected to more than triple by 2025."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s promising that they report that early and middle-life bilingualism has a beneficial effect on cognitive health in later life,\u201d said Miguel Arce Renter\u00eda, a neuropsychologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis would line up with the existing literature.\u201d",
      "In recent years, scientists have gained a greater understanding of bilingualism and the aging brain, though not all their findings have aligned. Some have found that if people who have fluency in two languages develop dementia, they\u2019ll ",

      ", they may be able to deploy similar strategies in other skills \u2014 such as multitasking, managing emotions and self-control \u2014 that help delay dementia later on.",
      "The new study tested 746 people age 59 to 76. Roughly 40 percent of the volunteers had no memory problems, while the others were patients at memory clinics and had experienced confusion or memory loss.",
      "All were tested on a variety of vocabulary, memory, attention and calculation tasks. They were asked to recall previously named objects, for example, and to spell words backward, follow three-part commands and copy designs presented to them.",
      "Volunteers who reported using a second language daily between age 13 and 30 or between age 30 and 65 had higher scores on language, memory, focus, attention, and decision-making abilities compared with those who were not bilingual at those ages.",
      "Investigating bilingualism at different life stages is a unique approach, said Boon Lead Tee, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. With the impressively large sample size, she said, the authors of the study can probably generate other novel results, such as whether the age at which a person acquired each language affected their cognition in later life.",
      "She cautioned, however, that the study only focused on one aspect of bilingualism: using two languages every day for long periods of time. The positive effects on cognition may turn out to be caused by another factor, such as the age at which the two languages were encoded into memory, or the particular demographic or life experiences of people who happen to be bilingual.",
      "Other experts agreed that the results might have been different if the researchers had asked volunteers if they had spoken a second language once a week, or even less frequently, rather than every day.",

      "It\u2019s also crucial for future research to look at the broader benefits of bilingualism, said Dr. Blanco-Elorrieta, who speaks Basque, English, German and Spanish.",
      "\u201cThe advantage of being bilingual doesn\u2019t really lie on these milliseconds of advantage that one can have in a cognitive task,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the importance of being bilingual is being able to communicate with two cultures and two ways of seeing the world.\u201d"

      " in JAMA Oncology adds a new twist, finding that while breast density declines with age, a slower rate of decline in one breast often precedes a cancer diagnosis in that breast.",
      "Scientists at Washington University in St. Louis analyzed breast density changes over a 10-year period in 10,000 women who were free of cancer when the study started. Some 289 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in that time; the study compared changes in their breast tissue to those in 658 similar women who did not develop breast cancer.",
      "Breast density was higher from the start in the women who went on to develop breast cancer, and density declined in all women over time. But when each breast\u2019s density was measured separately, scientists found a significantly slower decline in density in breasts that developed cancer, when compared with the other breast in the same patient.",
      "Shu Jiang, the study\u2019s lead author and an associate professor of public health sciences at Washington University, said the findings might provide an individualized and dynamic tool for assessing a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk. \u201cI hope they can get this into clinical use as soon as possible \u2014 it will make a huge difference,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, everybody only looks at density at one point in time,\u201d Dr. Jiang added. But women have mammograms at regular intervals throughout their lives, and the density of each breast is measured each time.",
      "\u201cSo this information is actually already available, but it\u2019s not being utilized,\u201d she said. Now, a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer could \u201cbe updated every time she gets a new mammogram.\u201d",
      "Breast density is now an acknowledged risk factor for breast cancer, albeit one of many. Dense tissue also makes tumors harder to detect in imaging scans.",

      "Although women are provided the information about breast density and the risks associated with it, the study suggests that information could be better used. \u201cWe need to know how to follow women with dense breasts, instead of just alerting them,\u201d Dr. Knudsen said.",
      "One next step may to be examine breast density over time in women taking medication to prevent breast cancer to see if the density decreases, Dr. Knudsen suggested.",

The energy that gripped the arena at the start of the game against Miami had dissolved into a m\u00e9lange of people shuffling out, Heat fans boasting and a few Knicks fans shouting insults, mostly at the game officials and the Heat fans.",
      "Perspective is difficult to have in a moment like this.",
      "\u201cI was horrific,\u201d said Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson, who scored 25 points but missed all seven of his 3-point attempts.",
      "On Sunday, the Knicks lost to the Heat, 108-101, in Game 1 of the N.B.A.\u2019s Eastern Conference semifinals. They lost even though the Heat star Jimmy Butler didn\u2019t have the kind of scoring explosion he used to knock off the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the playoffs.",
      "But despite the dour mood that engulfed the Garden after the game, it would be unwise to bury the Knicks for their performance. In some ways, everything the Knicks are doing in the playoffs is a bonus. Perhaps more important, there is still time for them to survive this series.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thought this game was going to be, or the series was going to be, won or lost in the first game,\u201d Knicks guard Josh Hart said. He added later: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an opportunity that we let slip away. It\u2019s going to be a tough, physical series and every game\u2019s different.\u201d",
      "Neither the Heat nor the Knicks were expected to last very long in the playoffs.",
      "The Knicks finished the regular season as the fifth seed in the East, facing a Cleveland Cavaliers team that had traded for the star the Knicks wouldn\u2019t \u2014 Donovan Mitchell.",
      "The Heat faced even longer odds as the eighth seed against a Bucks team expected to compete for the championship and led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is a finalist for this year\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award.",
      "Instead, the Heat and the Knicks easily dispatched their first-round opponents, each needing just five games to do it. Miami benefited from an injury to Antetokounmpo and the dynamism of Butler. Butler scored 56 points in Miami\u2019s Game 4 win against the Bucks and 42 in the series-clinching win two days later.",
      "That meant containing Butler would be critical for the Knicks, a team driven by its defense and depth.",
      "The Knicks had home-court advantage and a tactical advantage in that Coach Tom Thibodeau knows Butler well. He coached Butler with the Chicago Bulls for Butler\u2019s first four seasons in the N.B.A., and again when Butler played for the Minnesota Timberwolves.",
      "On Sunday, Butler had 25 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. More critically, the attention he commanded on the court made things easier for his teammates, many of whom have thrived under playoff pressure before.",
      "The Knicks\u2019 shooting was also particularly damaging for them. Brunson wasn\u2019t the only one who struggled from 3. Overall, the Knicks made only 20.6 percent of their 3-pointers, including just 3 of 16 in the first half.",
      "With 5 minutes 5 seconds remaining, Butler struggled to rise from the court after turning his ankle while tangling with Hart. He refused to leave the game. With Butler hobbled, the Heat relied on guard Kyle Lowry and extended their lead to 11 points from 3.",
      "\u201cThat certainly is inspiring that he would not come out of the game,\u201d Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd to be able to finish the game just infused a bunch of confidence to the rest of the guys that we have to finish this off.\u201d",
      "Historically, when the Heat and Knicks have played each other in the playoffs, the battles have more closely resembled boxing matches than basketball games. Their physicality was legendary in the 1990s, with the Knicks\u2019 Patrick Ewing and Miami\u2019s Alonzo Mourning, both of whom were at Sunday\u2019s game, going at each other in the paint.",
      "Sunday\u2019s game was higher scoring than those contests from a quarter-century ago, but was similarly physical.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t just assume that each game is going to look like this,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played these guys four times during the regular season. Two of the games were in the mud like this, the throwback Heat and Knicks that you would expect. And then we had two shootouts.\u201d",
      "But he also said he expected the series to be a \u201ccagefight.\u201d",
      "What the Knicks have done already this postseason is cause for optimism for their future.",
      "They were not supposed to make a deep playoff run this year even with Brunson, who was a finalist for the league\u2019s Most Improved Player Award. The Knicks are widely considered to be one superstar away from being championship contenders. If they win this series and get to the conference finals, they will have surpassed most expectations.",
      "They have avoided the kind of ridiculous drama that characterized the decade-long desert they wandered through until creating a stable environment with Thibodeau at the helm.",
      "The Knicks beat the Cavaliers soundly, justifying their unwillingness to gut their roster in order to trade for Mitchell.",
      "Their depth propelled them against Cleveland. It is why they have often succeeded even when playing short-handed.",
      "On Sunday, they were playing without Julius Randle, who is out with a sprained ankle. Thibodeau refused to use that as an excuse for why they lost the game.",
      "\u201cWe have more than enough,\u201d he said after the game.",
      "The Heat were also missing a key player \u2014 guard Tyler Herro, who broke his hand during the first round and is expected to be out for several weeks.",
      "Butler did not address reporters after the game, and Spoelstra said he didn\u2019t know the status of Butler\u2019s injury. But if it is serious, it could change the complexion of the series. Still, the Knicks saw what the Heat did in the first round against the Bucks and know how difficult they can be.",

      "There was a loud commotion near a hot dog vendor inside Madison Square Garden moments before a playoff game between the Knicks and the Miami Heat on Sunday. A group of Knicks fans spotted another Knicks fan and started cursing. Other people turned their heads, cautiously moving away from the group; a fight seemed to be brewing.",
      "But as the fans walked toward each other, locked arms and began jumping around, it became clear that this was not about to be a brawl. At the center was Darryl Thompson, in a blue custom-made Knicks shirt with a four-letter word in orange and the name of the Heat\u2019s best player: Jimmy Butler. All of the cursing? That was just the fans, uh, reading the shirt\u2019s message out loud.",
      "\u201cI made it,\u201d Thompson, 37, said proudly. \u201cIt took about 30 minutes. I came up with an idea instantly and all that. I called some personal people to get it pressed up for me. We just made one. We don\u2019t want this floating around.\u201d",
      "Moments like that filled Sunday\u2019s Game 1 between the Knicks and the Heat, the first second-round playoff game at the Garden in a decade. During the Knicks\u2019 first-round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Knicks fans stormed Seventh Avenue outside the arena, climbed poles, danced and drank after victories.",
      "But on Sunday, the Knicks lost at home for the first time this postseason, 108-101, after being up by as much as 12 points during the first half. Seventh Avenue was desolate afterward, lined with police officers who were prepared for a raucous crowd but instead watched fans jump through puddles in the pouring rain as they headed for trains home. Game 2 is Tuesday at the Garden.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the fans from Sunday.",
      "Underneath Greg Dell\u2019s Knicks hat is his hairless head, which he uses to show people how long he has been a fan of the team. \u201cSince 12 years old,\u201d he yelled, \u201cback when I had hair.\u201d The Knicks\u2019 shortcomings over his 36 years of fandom have likely contributed to some of the hair loss, but he wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything else, he said. And once you turn 12 years old, he added, you can\u2019t change your team unless you move to a new city.",
      "Dell said this has been the most exciting Knicks season he can remember since the team went to the 1999 N.B.A. finals because they finally feel like a legitimate contender. He said he was \u201cthrowing away\u201d the Game 1 loss and predicted that the Knicks would wrap the series up in six games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like dating,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to find a loyal person \u2014 your spouse, your girlfriend \u2014 ask them their favorite team. If they say the Knicks, they\u2019re loyal. They\u2019re not cheating on you. They\u2019re not leaving you. That\u2019s us.\u201d",
      "Miguel Garcia and his two brothers, Danny and John, grew up in the long shadow of the Garden at 43rd Street and Ninth Avenue, close enough to hear some of the noise from around the arena on game days.",
      "Their first Knicks memory was from Game 3 of the 1999 Eastern Conference finals when forward Larry Johnson was fouled as he ",
      " and then swished the ensuing free throw to give the Knicks a 92-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers.",
      "On Sunday, they entered the Garden clad in different colored wigs they purchased from Party City because they \u201chad to go crazy\u201d for the special day.",
      "\u201cYou know, I have no hair, so I needed to put something on,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "Francis Vasquez stopped others nearby from talking, seemingly so they could understand the importance of what he was about to say. Vasquez lifted one hand as they watched: This one was for God, he said, before lifting his other hand just slightly beneath that one, which, he said, was for the Knicks.",
      "Greg Dell and Vasquez met on Sunday after the game at a bar, and Vasquez said their relationship was reflective of what he loved about Knicks fandom.",
      "\u201cI could feel his energy, and he could feel my energy,\u201d he said, \u201cso that just builds a connection.\u201d",
      "Vasquez grew up in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, where he built an unrelenting support for a team that has never rewarded him for it with a title. Still, Vasquez said, he would \u201cdie for his Knicks.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let us win the championship; it\u2019s going to be a riot that day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get locked up that day.\u201d",
      "Leah Romito had never been interested in basketball. But over the last two seasons, her 8-year-old son, Axel, has fallen in love with Knicks forward Julius Randle and guard Jalen Brunson, turning her into a fan, too. On Sunday, she followed her son\u2019s directions, yelling and cheering as if she had been born into Knicks fandom like many of the others in the Garden.",
      "It was the first game she had been to with Axel. ",
      ", but Randle sat out because of an ankle injury. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Axel said. \u201cVery sad.\u201d",
      "Lakeisha Reid paid $1,500 to go to the game with her girlfriend. She said she has been a Knicks fan since she was a teenager, drawn to the excitement that the former star center Patrick Ewing, who attended Sunday\u2019s game, brought her father and to people across New Jersey, where she grew up.",
      "Sunday was her first-ever Knicks game, so she planned an eye-popping outfit for the occasion that featured shiny blue pompoms. \u201cYou only live once,\u201d she said, \u201cand I was like, \u2018We want to do it right.\u2019\u201d",
      "Reid said she was most surprised by the friendliness of the crowd, which she described as \u201ccrazy but polite.\u201d Reid remembered fans yelling for others to sit down and people listening without debate. One fan switched seats with her girlfriend to make her more comfortable.",
      "\u201cUp north we\u2019re known for being a little hard, and sometimes we could be a little loud, but at the game it was just the up-north love, the vibe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just no drama. It was beautiful.\u201d",
      "Satchel Aviram grew up in Westchester County, N.Y., loving the Knicks for as long as he can remember. He appreciates the fan base primarily because Knicks fans are loyal through the few ups and the innumerable downs, unlike Nets fans, he said.",
      "\u201cThe second the Nets lose, they know it\u2019s over. When the Knicks lose, we know we\u2019re going to fight,\u201d Aviram said. \u201cThe team is behind the Knicks always, and the city is behind the Knicks.\u201d",
      "Aviram said the rain and gray skies could have been reflected in a gloomy feeling among fans after the loss, but instead he said he felt a positive \u201celectricity\u201d in most fans looking forward to Game 2.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been down for so long that it\u2019s meant so much for the city that we\u2019re finally battling,\u201d Aviram said, \u201cand it seems like we finally have it figured out that we can go forward.\u201d"

      "Patrice Bergeron\u2019s final hug on the ice on Sunday was reserved for Brad Marchand, his longtime linemate and friend. It was longer and tighter than the other hugs he shared with his teammates, and it brought Bergeron to tears as somber fans stood and cheered.",
      "If it was Bergeron\u2019s final moment in a Boston Bruins uniform, so ends a magnificent 19-year career that places him in the pantheon of great Boston athletes. He did not win as many championships as Bill Russell or Tom Brady. He was not a three-time most valuable player like Larry Bird. He was not as clutch as David Ortiz and did not change the game the way Bobby Orr did.",
      "But somewhere on that glittering list stands Bergeron, one of the greatest two-way centers in hockey history. He is perhaps a few spots higher than he otherwise might be because of his unmistakable class and the fact that he played his entire career, at least, so far, for the Bruins.",
      "\u201cHe is one of the best to ever play the game,\u201d Marchand said in March, when the Bruins appeared invincible. \u201cHe\u2019s also one of the best leaders ever. It\u2019s hard for anyone to drag their feet when your best player and oldest guy is out there setting the example.\u201d",
      "Marchand and his teammates, including David Krejci, ",
      " about how this season was planned and organized by the Bruins to win the Stanley Cup for Bergeron in what might be the beloved captain\u2019s final season. His age matches his iconic number, 37, which will eventually hang above the ice at TD Garden in Boston. He will also certainly be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame one day, but perhaps it will be with a tinge of disappointment \u2014 as there was with Orr \u2014 that there could have been more success, including this year.",
      "Bergeron won a Stanley Cup with the Bruins in 2011 along with Marchand and Krejci, and that is more than some great players achieve. But the Bruins also lost in the finals in 2013 and 2019, and now there\u2019s this, a particularly sorrowful and painful ending.",
      "Perhaps he was crying Sunday night because of the immediate and colossal disappointment, and not because he knew it was his final N.H.L. game. Bergeron and the Bruins skated off the ice after a ",
      " to the Florida Panthers at home in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series. Afterward, Bergeron indicated the decision on his future had not been finalized.",
      "\u201cIt hurts right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to step back and give it some thought with my family.\u201d",
      "Bergeron and his teammates had hoped, maybe even expected, to see their names carved into the Stanley Cup at the end of the playoffs. Instead, their names will be added to a ",
      " of the most bitter Boston sports disappointments in recent memory, including their own Game 7 loss at home to the St. Louis Blues in the 2019 finals.",
      "But because they had been so good and had the highest of expectations, this stunning outcome was slightly reminiscent of the loss of the undefeated 2007 Patriots to the Giants in the Super Bowl. This one came long before the final stage, but it was devastating, nonetheless.",
      "In the regular season, the Bruins won 65 games, more than any other team in N.H.L. history, a record that now taunts them and their fans. On Sunday, after building a three-games-to-one lead in their series with Florida \u2014 and holding a 3-2 lead with one minute left in regulation \u2014 the Panthers pulled their goalie for a sixth skater and Brandon Montour scored to send the game to overtime. There, ",
      " for Florida, and the Bruins became the latest victim of the curse of the Presidents\u2019 Trophy.",
      "Since Chicago won the Stanley Cup in 2013, no team that led the league in wins (an accomplishment for which that dubious trophy is awarded) has won the Stanley Cup. Only four times has a team won both since the 2000-1 season, and the Bruins became the eighth straight Presidents\u2019 Trophy winner to lose in the first or second round.",
      "Perhaps they all suffered from bad luck, or perhaps there is something more substantive in those numbers. For some teams, it could be the lack of competitive games toward the end of the season. For others, it could have been overconfidence.",
      "For the Bruins, it may have been the pursuit of history that did them in, and the weight of expectations. They ",
      " and secured a playoff spot before any other team. The Bruins won 16 of their last 17 games in the regular season, but eked out wins instead of dominating. They pushed to the final game, perhaps to add to their record, or in an attempt to stay sharp.",
      "But come the playoffs, Florida was sharper, meaner and had more intent. The Bruins, with arguably the best and deepest defensive core in the league during the regular season, looked tentative and tight. They had difficulty breaking the puck out of their zone and made numerous uncharacteristic turnovers that led to goals.",
      "Bergeron, who played in 78 of 82 games in the regular season, did not play in the first four games of the series because of a herniated disk that he may have suffered in the final regular-season game in Montreal on April 13. In the three playoff games he did skate, the Bruins lost.",
      "\u201cObviously, it\u2019s extremely disappointing,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially with the team that we had.\u201d",
      "Bergeron, a second-round draft pick in 2003, joined the Bruins at age 18 and has played in 1,294 regular-season games. He has amassed 1,040 points in the regular season, including 427 goals, and he probably prevented a thousand or more by opponents (he had a plus-minus rating of +289).",
      "He also had 128 points in 170 playoff games, and Zdeno Chara, the former Bruins captain, often lauded Bergeron as his effective co-captain.",
      "Best known for his offensive and defensive wholeness, Bergeron won a record five Selke Trophies as the league\u2019s best defensive forward, most recently in 2022, but is also one of league\u2019s most expert face-off men. According to NHL.com, ",
      ", more than any other player since 2005, and his 58.7 winning percentage is eighth best in history and highest among active players.",
      "He also won two Olympic gold medals with Canada, in 2010 and 2014, and won a world championship in 2004, all while setting a shimmering example of professionalism.",
      "After Sunday\u2019s loss, Marchand was asked about Bergeron and the possibility that his friend\u2019s career was over. Marchand grew emotional, appearing to fight back tears.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s obviously too many memories to list,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cBut the friendship we\u2019ve built and the relationship we have has been special. So, hopefully, it\u2019s not.\u201d"

      "SACRAMENTO \u2014 The Golden State Warriors prepared for the finale of their first-round playoff series with the Sacramento Kings by gathering for an off-day film session on Saturday on an upper floor of Chase Center, their home arena in San Francisco, with a panoramic view of the bay.",
      "Coach Steve Kerr likes to stage his film sessions there when the space is available. Otherwise, he said, the team is stuck \u201cin the dungeon down below,\u201d outside its locker room. He was grateful for the open space, especially ahead of Sunday\u2019s Game 7. It was a therapeutic experience.",
      "\u201cI do think there has to be a sense of perspective,\u201d Kerr said, \u201ceven if it\u2019s just a nice view and some sunshine and a chance to breathe and relax between games. That can make a difference.\u201d",
      "Something else can make a difference, too: Stephen Curry. No one seemed more Zen on Sunday than Curry, who led the Warriors to a series-clinching, 120-100 victory by skewering the Kings in every conceivable way on his way to 50 points \u2014 ",
      ". He sank parabolic 3-pointers. He drove for layups. He toyed with defenders. And he sent scores of Kings fans streaming into the streets of Sacramento before the game had ended.",
      "\u201cSublime,\u201d Kerr said.",
      "\u201cTotal domination,\u201d Warriors forward Draymond Green said.",
      "\u201cA joy to watch,\u201d guard Klay Thompson said.",

      "\u201cIt was a great time to put it all together,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThere\u2019s still nerves and anxiousness and anticipation before a big night. But when we get out there, our experience takes over.\u201d",
      "Curry, who arrived at the Golden 1 Center in an all-black ensemble, as if dressed for a wake, shot 20 of 38 from the field and 7 of 18 from 3-point range. He also had eight rebounds and six assists.",
      "\u201cWhat an incredible all-time performance,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "Golden State, the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference, will face the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in a conference semifinal, starting in San Francisco on Tuesday. The Lakers eliminated the second-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in their first-round series on Friday.",
      "\u201cTo do this for a decade, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Kerr said of his core players. \u201cThe energy that it takes to fight off challengers year after year, and have to prepare and win games, and do it over and over \u2014 there\u2019s a reason these guys are Hall of Famers and champions.\u201d",
      "The Warriors and Kings franchises have long been based less than 100 miles apart, but for much of the past decade they have produced very different brands of basketball \u2014 opposite brands of basketball, in fact.",
      "As the Warriors busied themselves by winning championships (four), playing in N.B.A. finals (six) and re-engineering the way basketball is played thanks to the Splash Brothers (Curry and Thompson), the Kings spent the past decade-plus scuffling through a desert of futility that had them bordering on irrelevance.",
      "Their overhaul began last season when they acquired Sabonis, an All-Star center, in a deal with Indiana. It continued over the off-season when they signed the reserve guard Malik Monk in free agency, traded with Atlanta for Kevin Huerter and hired Mike Brown, one of Kerr\u2019s assistants, as their coach.",
      "Sure enough, led by De\u2019Aaron Fox, their All-Star point guard, the Kings went 48-34 during the regular season, christening each victory by shooting a beam of purple light from the roof of their arena. \u201c",
      ", helping to bury \u2014 if not completely erase \u2014 the dysfunction of years past.",
      "On Saturday night, ahead of Game 7, Brown dined at a Sacramento-area restaurant with his partner\u2019s son. A small parade of young boys approached their table to ask Brown some incisive questions about the team\u2019s players. They asked about Sabonis\u2019s right thumb, which he had fractured during the regular season. They asked about Fox\u2019s broken left index finger. They asked if the first-year forward Keegan Murray would be ready to shoot in Game 7.",
      "\u201cAnd one of the kids was a Warriors fan, so they started ribbing him,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not! No, I\u2019m not!\u2019 But he had a Golden State Warriors hat on.\u201d",
      "More than anything, Brown said, he could sense their excitement \u2014 a type of postseason anticipation that Sacramento had not experienced in years.",
      "As for the Warriors, their roster seemed to constantly be in a state of flux during the regular season. Curry injured a shoulder and sprained an ankle. Andrew Wiggins, their starting small forward, left the team in mid-February citing personal reasons and missed the final 25 games of the regular season.",
      "Kerr, meanwhile, struggled to strike a balance between securing a playoff berth (no sure thing) and developing young players like Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga and James Wiseman, who was eventually traded midseason. Ultimately, Kerr kept leaning on the usual suspects \u2014 Curry, Thompson and Green, a defensive stalwart \u2014 as the postseason came into sharper focus.",
      "The Warriors welcomed Wiggins\u2019s return for the start of the playoffs, then lost their first two games, which presented a new obstacle: Curry, Thompson and Green found themselves trailing in a playoff series, 2-0, for the first time in their careers. Perhaps they needed a fresh challenge.",
      "On Sunday, Sacramento led, 58-56, at halftime, which is when Golden State \u2014 a team known for years for ",
      " \u2014 went about its usual business. Curry sank a 3-pointer. He sliced through a mix of defenders to scoop in a layup. He drained a floater.",
      "\u201cYou can tell when he\u2019s locked in or laser-focused,\u201d Green said.",
      "By the time Kevon Looney, the team\u2019s starting center, scored off an offensive rebound, Golden State led by 9.",
      "The prevailing mood of the Kings fans inside the arena was not necessarily panic, but there was certainly angst. Curry had already been in this sort of situation on so many occasions, and none of it \u2014 not the hostile environment, not the pressure of a Game 7 \u2014 appeared to bother him. In fact, he was feeding off it.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the best players in the history of the game,\u201d Kerr said, adding: \u201cThe resilience and the work that goes into that, the focus, it\u2019s incredible to watch.",
      "As Golden State\u2019s lead swelled in the fourth quarter, the crowd\u2019s angst turned to resignation.",
      "Looney ",
      " with a double-double, 11 points and 21 rebounds.",
      "\u201cThe guy is a flat-out winner and a machine,\u201d Kerr said.",

      ", has traveled to Marseille for another installment of French soccer\u2019s biggest rivalry. There, it \u200ctakes another step toward its latest championship behind goals from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Lionel Messi.",
      "\u200cThat yawning gulf between the teams is something that the owners of Paris F.C. are eager to close. They argue that the Paris region, with its population of more than 12 million, deserves an elite league rivalry, the kind that courses through European cities like London and Lisbon, Madrid and Milan.",
      "The problem, Paris F.C. is finding, is that even with soccer\u2019s deepest pool of talent on its doorstep and backing from its own Gulf royals, closing the gap in a one-team town is extremely hard.",
      "Sitting in a brasserie close to his home in an upscale neighborhood that houses the tomb of Napoleon, Pierre Ferracci, the majority owner of Paris F.C., is ruminating on why Paris \u2014 one of the world\u2019s great cities and ",
      " than just about any other metropolis in the world \u2014 has only one top-division team, Paris St.-Germain.",
      "Ferracci, 70, lists a group of European capitals before moving on to other large cities to underline the outlier that is Paris. He eventually lands on London, less than a three-hour train ride away, which currently has so many teams playing in the Premier League that Ferracci gives up on naming them all.",
      "He explains away the contrast between France and England (and Germany and Spain and Italy) as a type of French exceptionalism. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural,\u201d Ferracci says. \u201cWe are less hung up on football than other countries.\u201d",
      "He knows that devotion to the sport, at least in Paris, does not run deep. \u201cThe supporters here come when there is success, when we climb the rungs of the ladder,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stop coming when the team descends.\u201d",
      "In the stands at the Charl\u00e9ty, the few supporters seem to confirm that view as they offer different motivations for their presence. Zouber Hadj-Larbi, a self-described P.S.G. fan, said he decided to attend his first Paris F.C. game because it was a much cheaper option than a ticket for the team he actually supports.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also a lot less spectacular,\u201d he said, laughing as the home team struggled to muster a shot on goal. Others in the crowd are tourists; a few say they are taking in the game only because P.S.G. was on the road.",
      "Nearby, Laurent Pinet, part of Paris F.C.\u2019s small cohort of regular fans, commiserated with a friend about the team\u2019s struggles to attract a following. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to be a football club in Paris than anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need immediate results to attract the public.\u201d",
      "Ferracci, who has been the majority owner of the club for 13 years, is confident fans will turn out in greater numbers if the team is playing in the top division, drawn by both its success and its name. \u201cThe opportunity we have,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we have a good name: Paris F.C.\u201d",
      "He admits his club is unlikely to ever be a true rival to P.S.G., and definitely not as long as its neighbor is bankrolled by Qatar. But careful and deliberate plans have been laid to build a team that could finally give Parisians a second top-flight option.",
      "That plan is reliant on tapping a resource Paris has in abundance: talented young soccer players.",
      "Ferracci\u2019s ideas for reviving Paris F.C. crystallized after a dinner with the famed French manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger a couple years after he took control of the club in 2008. Wenger used hard data, anecdotes and a list of professional players who had grown up in greater Paris to make his point. Ferracci now often does the same.",
      "By his reckoning, 13 percent of all registered soccer players in France are from Paris or its ring of suburbs, and a staggering 50 percent of the professionals making a living in France\u2019s top two divisions grew up in the capital or its shadow. Those players populate not only France\u2019s national team but several others: Morocco. Senegal. Tunisia. Algeria. At last year\u2019s World Cup, for example, Paris F.C. could track seven of its own alumni among the participants.",
      "Just being close to the best players, though, is not enough, said Jean Marc Nobilo. A well-traveled coach, Nobilo was hired two years ago to lead Paris F.C.\u2019s youth development section, and he knows that every big team in Europe ",
      ".",
      "Ferocious competition for that talent means Paris F.C. is required to unearth it before it has been spotted by others. Bidding wars are typically won by richer teams, thanks in part to French soccer rules that allow clubs to pay fees \u2014 sometimes as much as $100,000 \u2014 to the parents of gifted children.",
      "For economic reasons alone, Nobilo said, \u201cwe must be on the case before the others.\u201d",
      "To ensure that Paris F.C. can do that, Ferracci has enlisted star power and Gulf money of his own. The former arrived in the form of a Paris Saint-Germain legend, the retired Brazilian midfielder Ra\u00ed, who was hired to be a club ambassador and a connection to soccer\u2019s other great talent basin, S\u00e3o Paulo.",
      "The much-needed money arrived as an investment from the rulers of Bahrain, the Gulf emirate that three years ago ",
      "Ceding stakes to foreign partners \u2014 in addition to the Bahrainis, there are Americans, an Indian group and also Armenian equity owners of Paris F.C. \u2014 has been somewhat bittersweet for Ferracci. The cash has helped finance a multimillion-dollar makeover of the club\u2019s training facilities, located on the edge of Paris close to Orly airport, and has helped the club to invest in new talent and the staff to find more of it.",
      "But it has also made Paris F.C. yet another club reliant on foreign capital, a trend that Ferracci laments even as he benefits from it. He says his Gulf royals have been far less munificent than the Emirati owners at Manchester City or the Qataris at P.S.G. \u2014 Paris F.C.\u2019s annual revenues of 23 million euros ($25.4 million) are roughly half of what Messi is earning to play across town \u2014 and Ferracci is fine with that.",
      "\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like are countries like the Emirates and Qatar investing in football because it sets the bar too high,\u201d he said, before launching into an unironic soliloquy about how Gulf-funded clubs have destabilized the soccer industry, forcing rivals to risk financial ruin to try to keep up.",
      "Ferracci is determined to maintain control of his team for as long as he can.",
      "\u201cToday I still want the majority of the capital to be in local hands, that the majority stays French and national,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because if we continue like this, every club in the top two leagues will be in the hands of foreign investors, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",
      "For the moment, he is focusing on what his investors, and his plan, have allowed him to pursue: a dream of creating the best finishing school in French soccer. New facilities, the chance to play close to home and the ability to offer teenagers an earlier shot at first-team soccer all give Paris F.C. a fighting chance of meeting its aim of filling at least a third of its roster with homegrown talent. Five players in Paris F.C.\u2019s current squad came through its youth ranks. But it needs even more.",
      "How it handles those recruits and the others that arrive will determine the success of his project. Paris F.C. is currently bumbling through another year in the middle of the second division standings. That means rubbing shoulders with P.S.G., even as a minor irritant rather than a true rival, will have to wait at least another year.",
      "\u201cFor now, they are aware of our existence,\u201d said Pinet, one of the team\u2019s regular fans. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about rivalry later.\u201d",

      "Mike Shannon, who played in three World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals and then became a favorite of the team\u2019s fans as one of its radio broadcasters for 50 seasons, died on Saturday. He was 83.",
      "The Cardinals announced the death but did not give a cause or say where he died. Shannon had been hospitalized in 2020 with Covid-19 and later suffered from symptoms of long Covid.",
      "Shannon was one of the few announcers in baseball history to spend 50 years or more with one team. His longevity was among the things that endeared him to listeners, along with his exuberance and his passion for seeing the Cardinals win.",
      "In 2003, when the Cardinal slugger Albert Pujols hit a home run after being brushed back by the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Kerry Wood, ",
      " Take a ride on that knockdown pitch, big boy! Kerry Wood knocked him down and now Albert looks at him as he goes around first. He gives him the glare, saying, \u2018Take a whiff of that, big boy!\u2019\u201d",
      " the former NBC sportscaster whose early professional work was in St. Louis, said that Shannon\u2019s roots there were a key to his success. \u201cHe was one of those guys,\u201d he said by phone, \u201clike Herb Score in Cleveland, Joe Nuxhall in Cincinnati and Jerry Remy in Boston, where it works because he\u2019s local, he\u2019s one of our guys \u2014 and, in his case, grew up in St Louis and was a three-sport star in high school.\u201d",
      "Shannon was known for his signature home run call, \u201cGet up, baby, get up!\u201d and for odd and idiosyncratic lines: He referred to a pop-up as \u201ca home run in a telephone booth\u201d and to a Cardinal victory as a \u201cmonstramental win,\u201d and he once declared that a young fan who had been hit by a foul ball \u201cwill leave the stadium with a souvenir today \u2014 not a ball but a nice-looking bruise.\u201d",
      "Joe Buck, who, like his father, ",
      ", was one of Shannon\u2019s radio partners, said by phone: \u201cHis Shannonisms made for great listening, and some of it was so illogical. But you had to know he was one of the most common-sense people I\u2019ve ever met. He had a keen eye for the game and would have been a great manager.\u201d",
      "Thomas Michael Shannon was born on July 15, 1939, in St. Louis to Thomas and Elizabeth (Richason) Shannon. His father was a police officer and later became a city prosecutor.",
      "Mike was an outstanding athlete at Christian Brothers College High School, where he was a football all-American, and in 1957 he was named the Missouri prep player of the year in both basketball and football. He attended the University of Missouri for a year as a quarterback on a football scholarship. But he was also a baseball prospect, and in 1958 he signed with the Cardinals for what he said in his autobiography was almost $100,000, although it was reported at the time as $40,000.",
      "After four years in the minor leagues, he played sparingly with the Cardinals in 1962 and 1963, often as the late-innings defensive replacement for the great hitter Stan Musial, who was then in the final year of his Hall of Fame career.",
      "Shannon did not follow Musial into the Hall of Fame (although he played with several future Hall of Famers, including Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Orlando Cepeda and Steve Carlton). But he was a solid player whose two-run home run off the Yankees\u2019 Whitey Ford in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series tied the score at 4-4. The Cardinals won the game, 9-5, and went on to take the series in seven games.",
      "In 1967, Shannon moved from right field to third base after the Cardinals acquired Roger Maris from the Yankees. The two became close friends.",
      "St. Louis won the World Series again that year, beating the Boston Red Sox in seven games. The next year, the Detroit Tigers defeated the Cardinals, also in seven games. Shannon hit a home run in each of those series.",
      "Shannon played until 1970, when he developed membranous nephropathy, an autoimmune disorder of the kidneys, which ended his career. ",
      " with 68 home runs and 367 runs batted in, and was elected to the Cardinals\u2019 Hall of Fame in 2014. Two of his teammates died recently: the shortstop ",
      " last month and the catcher Tim McCarver, who also had a distinguished career as a broadcaster, in February.",
      "Shannon joined the Cardinals\u2019 promotions department in 1971 and became a team announcer the next season. In addition to calling Cardinal games, he was part of NBC\u2019s backup crew for its \u201cGame of the Week\u201d in the 1980s. He retired after the 2021 season.",
      "His survivors include his wife, Lori (Bergman) Shannon; his daughters, Patricia, Peg and Erin; his sons, Michael Jr., Tim and Dan; 18 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His first wife, Judith Ann (Bufe) Shannon, died in 2007.",
      "The ball that Shannon slugged in Game 1 of the 1964 World Series traveled more than 450 feet and broke the \u201cu\u201d in the Budweiser sign in left field at Busch Stadium, causing $5,000 in damage. At first, he thought he would have to pay for it.",
      "In his autobiography, \u201cGet Up, Baby!: My Seven Decades with the St. Louis Cardinals\u201d (2022, with Rick Hummel), he recalled: \u201cGussie Busch, our owner, said in that gravelly voice of his, \u2018That\u2019s all right, buddy. You can break the whole sign down.\u2019 And Gussie paid for it.\u201d"

Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig played there on a barnstorming tour, the novelist Haruki Murakami was inspired by a trip to the stadium to write his first novel and just last year Munetaka Murakami of the Yakult Swallows hit a record-breaking home run into the stadium\u2019s stands.",
      "An ambitious redevelopment plan, however, would have the stadium razed and replaced with a modern facility. The plan has come under intense scrutiny from disparate groups that include fans of baseball history, followers of the country\u2019s rugby history and conservationists who are concerned about how the various projects would affect the Jingu Gaien district, a historic green space that features century-old trees provided by the industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi, known by some as the father of Japanese capitalism.",
      "\u201cThis is like building skyscrapers in the middle of Central Park in New York,\u201d Mikiko Ishikawa, an emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo, ",
      " of the redevelopment plan. \u201cTokyo would lose its soul.\u201d",
      "Part of that soul lies in Meiji Jingu, Japan\u2019s second-oldest baseball stadium to Hanshin Koshien Stadium in Nishinomiya. The ballparks are Nippon Professional Baseball\u2019s answers to Major League Baseball\u2019s Fenway Park in Boston and Wrigley Field in Chicago.",
      "In the redevelopment plan, Meiji Jingu Stadium and a neighboring venue, the\u00a0Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium, which opened in 1947 and was used as a soccer venue during the 1964 Summer Olympics, would be demolished in phases. The new versions of the two stadiums would swap locations.",
      "The goal of the project is to modernize the various facilities involved, which are far out of date, and to create a better environment for moving between the stadiums. Open spaces would be created and enlarged and the hope is that it would be a hub for tourism and for people to enjoy the various sporting events that would be held there. The entire project, which includes skyscrapers and a hotel, is scheduled to be completed by 2036.",
      "At that point it will have been just over 100 years since a lineup of M.L.B. stars played five games at Meiji Jingu during a tour of Japan in 1934. Ruth put on a show by hitting 13 home runs, five of them in Meiji Jingu.

      "Beyond the stadium\u2019s history, the plans have raised concerns because the relocations would have the new baseball stadium run adjacent to a notable avenue of century-old ginkgo trees that are celebrated with an annual fall festival.",

      "\u201cThe roots have branches out as far as the top of the tree, which means they\u2019re branching out pretty far,\u201d Kopp said of the trees. \u201cTree experts have said, if you put this wall on the stadium, which is going to have piling going 40 meters into the ground, that is going to, for sure, damage the rest of the tree.\u201d",
      "In response to the criticisms, the developers have adjusted the plan for fewer trees to be felled, but activists have said that the trees\u2019 complex roots systems could still be compromised and that the amount of sunlight the trees receive will be affected by the new surrounding buildings.",
      "There are other concerns about the plans as well.",

      "Ralph Boston, the Olympic long jump champion who, in August 1960, broke the track star Jesse Owens\u2019s 25-year-old world record in the event, and a year later became the first jumper to break the 27-foot mark, died on Sunday at his home in Peachtree City, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. He was 83.",
      "The cause was complications of a stroke, his son Todd said.",
      "Boston dominated the long jump through much of the 1960s by breaking or tying world records six more times over that span. A tall and sinewy Mississippian, he won a gold medal in the Rome Olympics in 1960, a silver medal in Tokyo in 1964 and a bronze in Mexico City in 1968.",
      "Boston won the N.C.A.A. long jump title in 1960, when he was an emerging athlete at Tennessee State University (then known as the Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State University). In August, he burst onto the national scene at a conditioning meet in Los Angeles that served as a final tuneup before the Rome Olympics.",
      "The U.S. track team broke four world records in that event, but it was Boston\u2019s long jump \u2014 of 26 feet, 11 inches \u2014 that made the biggest headlines. The jump surpassed Owens\u2019s best, the previous world record, by three inches.",
      "\u201cJesse said it was all right to break it \u2014 he\u2019s tired of it,\u201d Boston told reporters that day. He had not actually spoken to Owens and eventually apologized to him when they met at the Rome Olympics. Owens was gracious.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to see the record broken, and I\u2019m just thankful that it stood up this long,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "Boston then broke the Olympic record (26 foot 7\u00bd inches) to win the gold medal in Rome. But his world-record performance in Los Angeles had already made him a star.",
      "He soared into history again in 1961 when he broke the 27-foot barrier \u2014 with a 27-foot-\u00bd-inch jump at the Modesto Relays in California. His personal best was a leap of 27 feet 5 inches at Modesto in 1965.",
      "Three years later, in Mexico City, Boston, on his way to winning a bronze Olympic medal there, was warming up for a jump when his teammate Bob Beamon leaped an astonishing 29 feet, 2\u00bd inches, shattering Boston\u2019s world record by nearly two feet. (The current record \u2014 29 feet, 4\u00bc inches \u2014 was set by the American ",
      " in 1991.)",
      "Boston often recalled an encounter he had with a fellow Olympian on a New York City street as the U.S. team was preparing to leave for Rome in 1960.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got a camera and he says, \u2018Ralph Boston, I want to take your picture,\u2019 and he snaps it,\u201d ",
      ". \u201cI said, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 And he said, \u2018You don\u2019t know me now, but you will. My name is ",
      ".\u2019\u201d",
      "Ralph Harold Boston was born on May 9, 1939, in Laurel, Miss., about 85 miles southeast of Jackson, to Peter and Eulalia Boston. His mother was a homemaker, his father a railroad fireman who took up farming after losing his right eye in a hunting accident. Ralph, the youngest of 10 children, helped his father in the fields before school.",
      "At Oak Park High School in Laurel, he became a star athlete, setting a national high school record in the 180-yard hurdles. As a biochemistry major at Tennessee State University, he competed in the high jump, sprints, high hurdles and triple jump, along with the long jump.",
      "\u201cI became a long jumper by accident,\u201d he said in an interview in 2015 with a local Mississippi television station. \u201cI wanted to play football, but my mother didn\u2019t like that. In those days, Mama prevailed.\u201d",
      "During the 1960s, he had an intense but friendly rivalry with the Soviet Union\u2019s long jumper ",
      ". At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Boston was a favorite to repeat as the gold medalist, but the steady rain and strong winds that affected his jumps led to an unexpected upset.",
      "Lynn Davies of Britain, a relative unknown, stood at the end of the runway and waited for the wind to die down for his final jump. When the wind momentarily calmed, he jumped to first place with a distance of 26 feet 5\u00bd inches.",
      "Until then, Ter-Ovanesyan, who had never beaten Boston in an outdoor meet, was ahead going into that fifth and final jump. But when Davies took the lead, \u201cBoston shrugged his shoulders and turned to Ter-Ovanesyan,\u201d The Times reported. \u201c\u2018There goes the gold medal,\u2019 Boston said.\u201d",
      "He managed to overcome his Soviet rival and take the silver medal with his final jump.",
      "Boston married Geneva Jackson Spencer in 1962. The couple had two sons, Todd and Stephen, before the marriage ended in divorce in 1971. In addition to his sons, he is survived by two sisters, Eugenia Angel and Bettye Beverly; a brother, Charles; three grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.",
      "Boston retired after the 1968 Olympics and served as coordinator of minority affairs and assistant dean of students at the University of Tennessee from 1968 to 1975. He covered track and field for CBS Sports as well as ESPN. Boston was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1974 and into the ",
      " in 1985. He became a corporate executive, eventually joining ServiceMaster Services, a cleaning company, in Stone Mountain, Ga., as president and chief executive.",
      "Boston was also known as a generous mentor and coach to fellow athletes. Beamon credited Boston for making Beamon\u2019s s record-breaking jump in Mexico City possible.",

      " in 2021. \u201cI fouled on my first two attempts and was about to get disqualified, and then Ralph told me I needed to adjust my footwork leading to my takeoff. I figured I had better listen to the master, and I did.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 A day before Major League Baseball played regular-season games here for the first time, Nick Martinez, a pitcher for the San Diego Padres, had an idea. Accompanied by a few teammates, he visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Friday, which was a day off for both the San Francisco Giants and the Padres.",
      "On the way to the church, Martinez noticed several shops selling pi\u00f1atas. He bought a few, hoping they could be smashed by the player of the game after each of the contests.",
      "\u201cBeing in San Diego, Mexican culture is very much a part of our culture,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd being here in Mexico for this series, the pi\u00f1atas were an opportunity to keep that Mexican culture in our clubhouse.\u201d",
      "So after the Padres defeated the Giants, 16-11, on Saturday, in a slugfest made possible by the conditions of Mexico City, Padres designated hitter Nelson Cruz donned a sombrero in the colors of the Mexican flag as he struggled to break open a Buzz Lightyear pi\u00f1ata. His teammates cheered him on while wearing Mexican lucha libre wrestling masks. And after a 6-4 Padres win on Sunday, first baseman Matt Carpenter sent candy flying onto the clubhouse floor when he busted open a pi\u00f1ata in the shape of a star.",
      "\u201cIt was a real short bat,\u201d Cruz explained later of his pi\u00f1ata troubles. He eventually gave up and ripped it open by hand. \u201cIf it had been a normal bat, it would\u2019ve been done with one swing.\u201d",
      "For two days at Estadio Alfredo Harp Hel\u00fa, the M.L.B. games were a celebration of Mexico and its love of baseball. The league had previously played regular-season games in Monterrey in 1996, 1999, 2018 and 2019. Exhibition contests were played in Mexico City in the past but playing games that mattered in the country\u2019s capital was different.",
      "M.L.B. wanted to do so in Mexico City sooner, but the $166 million stadium, which holds 20,000 fans, wasn\u2019t completed until 2019. The facility is home to the Mexican League\u2019s Diablos Rojos, a team owned by the Mexican billionaire Alfredo Harp Hel\u00fa, also a part owner of the Padres.",
      "Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world, a metropolis more populous (22 million) than New York City (20 million) and 2,000 feet higher in altitude than Denver, which is home to M.L.B.\u2019s Colorado Rockies and is famously a mile above sea level. It is also the largest city in North America without a franchise in the region\u2019s four major men\u2019s professional sports leagues (N.B.A., N.F.L., N.H.L. and M.L.B.).",
      "Soccer may be the biggest sport in Mexico but baseball has a strong foothold, particularly in certain regions of this country of 127 million people. Given how the Toronto Blue Jays are the M.L.B. team for all of Canada, baseball officials and fans have dreamed about the potential of an expansion franchise in Mexico City.",
      "\u201cIt would be a great experience,\u201d said Juan Soto, a star outfielder for the Padres who is from the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt makes me think of soccer, where those players live traveling from city to city.\u201d",
      "Even though M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred has praised the business prospects of Mexico City and the Mexican market as a whole ",
      ", he recently said that he had \u201cnever been close to the idea of Mexico as an expansion opportunity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe challenges are facility based,\u201d he said last week. \u201cEven the stadium that we\u2019re playing in this weekend is probably not big enough for a permanent home for a major league club. And then, of course, our season is so long. I have a union issue there that would have to be bargained to get players to live for that long of a period of time in Mexico.\u201d",
      "The current goal for Mexico, Manfred said, was to improve M.L.B.\u2019s relationships with existing professional baseball leagues there and to have the country become a North American equivalent of Japan, with \u201cvibrant, domestic professional play\u201d and \u201cstar players given the opportunity to come and play Major League Baseball.\u201d He said having more Mexican players in M.L.B. would help baseball appeal to the large Mexican American audience in the United States and create more broadcast interest in Mexico.",
      "Based on the weekend of games in Mexico City, there was indeed an appetite for the sport. The scenes in the stands and on the field reflected a spirited baseball culture. The tickets for the games sold out quickly in November. About 20,000 fans attended each game but it sounded like more.",
      "Mexican food \u2014 including micheladas, tacos, aguachile and churros \u2014 were sold in abundance. A mariachi band played throughout the games, performing a rendition of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\u201d during the seventh-inning stretch. Hundreds of fans lingered outside the stadium after the final game to send off both teams with cheers and waves.",
      "\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d said Manny Machado, a third baseman for the Padres whose family is from the Dominican Republic. \u201cWhat most impressed me was the fans and how passionate they were, especially for us Latinos who play with a lot of passion and energy.\u201d",
      "After each of the seven home runs they hit over the weekend, the Padres, the M.L.B. team closest to the Mexican border, put a sombrero on the head of the player who smashed the ball over the fence. Fernando Tatis Jr. bought it on Friday during a trip to the famous canals of Xochimilco in Mexico City. When Padres relievers walked out to the bullpen, they did so in lucha libre masks gifted to the team by the Mexican American professional wrestler Rey Mysterio.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Tatis said of playing in Mexico City. \u201cFor us Latin Americans, it\u2019s something beautiful to play in front of our people and taking the game to the kids who don\u2019t normally see us play in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Roughly three-quarters of the tickets sold online were purchased in Mexico, according to M.L.B., while the remaining tickets were purchased in the United States, primarily in California. But walking the stands, it felt like more Padres fans were visiting from the United States and several said they bought their tickets online through secondary-market resellers in Mexico.",
      "In the left-field bleachers, Felipe P\u00e9rez, 44, said he met many fans from the United States but also several Mexicans who had traveled from throughout the country. He was one of them; he said he took a seven-hour bus ride on Saturday from Veracruz, a city on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and arrived in Mexico City just in time for the 4 p.m. game. He returned home at 11 a.m. the next day.",
      "All that effort was worth it, P\u00e9rez said, because he loves baseball. He added in Spanish, \u201cI\u2019m happy. To see a big league game here, it\u2019s the best.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez had been waiting for these games. He and his family bought tickets for the April 2020 series in Mexico City between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Padres that was erased by the pandemic. He marveled at the atmosphere around him on Saturday as he nursed a beer.",
      "\u201cMexicans have a way of enjoying shows and life,\u201d P\u00e9rez said as fans stomped their feet for Tatis at the plate. \u201cPeople get behind a team. Look at how people are cheering.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Mexican baseball has improved on the international stage. On opening day M.L.B. rosters this season, there were 15 players born in Mexico, the highest total since 2005. In March, the Mexican national team finished third in the World Baseball Classic, its best showing in the tournament. And the most powerful fan in Mexico is its president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who hosted a breakfast on Sunday at El Palacio Nacional for, among others, Trevor Hoffman, a Hall of Famer who starred for the Padres; Sergio Romo, a reliever who won three World Series titles with the Giants; and Harp Hel\u00fa.",
      "Romo, who is Mexican American, said he didn\u2019t think the hurdles for Mexico City as a future M.L.B. home were as big as some may think. He said plenty of English was spoken in the international hub and that there was lots of tourism and history here.",
      "\u201cI do feel that Mexico does have a little bit of a bad rap in terms of like safety and whatnot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here in Mexico, you\u2019re safe. There\u2019s a lot of really cool things going on and obviously every city has their neighborhoods you don\u2019t want to go to. But this place has so many other spots that are so welcoming and open.\u201d",
      "Regular-season games, at the very least, are expected to return to Mexico City. As part of its overseas push in recent years, M.L.B. played ",
      ", expanding a world tour that already included Japan, Puerto Rico and Australia. In the latest labor agreement, M.L.B. and the players\u2019 union agreed to more regular-season games in London, some in Paris in 2025 and yearly trips to Mexico City from 2023 to 2026.",
      "The altitude and the turf in Mexico City will present some ongoing challenges \u2014 or advantages \u2014 to players. On Saturday, the ball zoomed through the thinner air and the teams combined for 11 home runs and 30 hits. Defenders said the ball skipped off the ground and rocketed past them.",
      "Pitchers said their pitches didn\u2019t move like usual, clarifying that it was even more of an issue than it is at Coors Field in Denver. After running the bases on Saturday, Cruz said he felt more out of breath. Yu Darvish, the Padres pitcher, said umpires told him he could call for a trainer during his start on Sunday if he was feeling too winded. Alex Cobb, a pitcher for the Giants, said his team\u2019s training staff provided more fluids and electrolytes to avoid dehydration.",
      "But for a team expected to contend for the playoffs, and which had been previously struggling at the plate, a memorable trip to Mexico City might have been exactly what the Padres needed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to stay here another week,\u201d said Machado, who homered twice."

      "The president of soccer\u2019s global governing body on Tuesday harshly criticized European broadcasters for not meeting FIFA\u2019s demands for significantly higher television rights fees for this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. If the offers did not improve, he threatened, the tournament\u2019s matches would not be televised in many of Europe\u2019s biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIt is our moral and legal obligation not to undersell the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup,\u201d the president, Gianni Infantino, said in ",
      " in Geneva. \u201cTherefore, should the offers continue not to be fair, we will be forced not to broadcast the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup into the \u2018Big 5\u2019 European countries,\u201d he added. That group includes England, Germany, France, Spain and Italy \u2014 all of whom will send teams to the tournament.",
      "Reeling off unverifiable figures, Infantino labeled the offers for the World Cup rights \u201ca slap in the face\u201d not only to the World Cup\u2019s players but to women generally.",
      "The comments escalated a fight Infantino opened last year, when he and FIFA rejected initial offers for rights to the women\u2019s championship from several countries as far too low. At the time, he framed the battle as one over fairness, and he has since positioned himself as a champion of women\u2019s soccer by increasing prize money for this year\u2019s tournament and pledging to equalize it with the men\u2019s World Cup by 2027.",
      "But he will need hundreds of millions of dollars from broadcasters and sponsors to fulfill those promises, and his threat that the games might not be broadcast in Europe \u2014 a major driver of the growth of the women\u2019s game \u2014 comes with serious risks.",
      "With little over two months to go until the start of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand and little sign of an accord, the dispute risks overshadowing the biggest Women\u2019s World Cup yet. FIFA has expanded the event to 32 teams for the first time as a sign of its commitment to grow the women\u2019s game, and it has increased the prize money for players and the support money for participating teams to $150 million, a fivefold increase from the last tournament, which was held in France in 2019.",
      "Infantino had hoped that much of that commitment would be financed by higher rights fees from international broadcasters. But in a rebuke to media companies both at the World Cup draw in Auckland last year and at FIFA\u2019s annual meeting in March in Rwanda, he said that was not the case. Each time, he lashed out at the television companies for not paying more for a product that, he said, viewership figures had proved was increasingly popular.",
      "With little movement since then, he took an even tougher line in his latest comments.",
      "\u201cI call, therefore, on all players, fans, football officials, presidents, prime ministers, politicians and journalists all over the world to join us and support this call for a fair remuneration of women\u2019s football,\u201d he said, repeating his remarks ",
      ". \u201cWomen deserve it. As simple as that.\u201d",
      "While women\u2019s soccer in the United States \u2014 where a TV deal is in place \u2014 and in Europe has enjoyed greater investment and ",
      " in recent years, figures for even its biggest games are often significantly lower than for comparable men\u2019s soccer games, and less attractive matches sometimes struggle to attract even in-stadium audiences. Broadcasters also appear to be taking a cautious stance on assigning a value to Women\u2019s World Cup rights that have never previously been on the market. This year is the first time FIFA has decoupled the women\u2019s tournament from the men\u2019s; previously, the women\u2019s rights were bundled as an extra in the bidding for the men\u2019s World Cup rights.",
      "Acknowledging that playing the tournament in Australia and New Zealand might be a factor for broadcasters in Europe, Infantino nonetheless said the sums currently being offered for the tournament were a fraction of what FIFA considers its true value. He noted that while viewing figures for the women\u2019s tournament are 50 percent to 60 percent of those for the men\u2019s World Cup, the amounts offered for the women\u2019s games have been much lower than that: In Europe alone, he said, they were \u201c20 to 100 times lower than for the men\u2019s FIFA World Cup.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhereas broadcasters pay $100-200 million for the men\u2019s FIFA World Cup,\u201d Infantino said, \u201cthey offer only $1-10 million for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup. This is a slap in the face of all the great FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup players and indeed of all women worldwide.\u201d",
      "There has been a substantial interest in women\u2019s soccer in Britain, Europe\u2019s biggest market, which peaked when England beat Germany to win the European championship on home soil last year. That final was played in front of a packed Wembley Stadium and watched by more than 17 million on television, the highest audience for a televised women\u2019s game in Britain. The figure for the final represented 35 percent of the total global audience for the game, according to data from European soccer\u2019s governing body.",
      "The same data, though, highlights how certain women\u2019s games in certain markets draw large audiences but highlights concerns among broadcasters over viewing figures for games not featuring premium teams in a tournament that will feature more games than ever. According to news media reports, the BBC and ITV \u2014 the two main British broadcasters \u2014 have offered about 9 million pounds ($11.2 million) for the World Cup rights, the highest among European broadcasters. The offer from Italy is about $1 million.",
      "The inability of FIFA and broadcasters to reach rights agreements in the next two months does not necessarily mean the games will be unavailable to fans in Europe. FIFA officials have previously spoken about possible alternatives, including airing the games on its own streaming platform or on FIFA\u2019s YouTube channel. Such a move would carry its own risks, however, both by reducing viewing figures and revenue for an event \u2014 and a sport \u2014 that FIFA has a stated commitment to grow."

      "For the small, insular world of triathlon, it has been a week.",
      "Last Monday, the International Testing Agency announced that Collin Chartier, a top American triathlete who had something of a breakout season last year, had tested positive for erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, a performance-enhancing substance that has long been a favorite among endurance athletes.",
      "EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells, which helps the body transport oxygen, ultimately increasing stamina. For years in professional cycling, it was about as common as saddle sores. Also, after more than two decades of doping scandals in nearly every sport, from track and field to baseball, most athletes, sports officials and fans have come to react to the latest positive test in the manner of Captain Renault entering Rick\u2019s Cafe in \u201cCasablanca.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.\u201d",
      "And yet Chartier\u2019s positive test, his acceptance of a three-year suspension from competition and his subsequent attempts \u2014 on one of the sport\u2019s leading podcasts and on social media \u2014 to own the violation, have rocked triathlon, producing the kind of shock and outrage over doping that recall a more innocent era.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really blown up the sport,\u201d said Dan Plews, who coaches several elite triathletes, including ",
      ", the reigning Ironman world champion.",
      "Sebastian Kienle of Germany, the 2014 Ironman world champion, pronounced himself \u201cvery sad and angry\u201d over Chartier\u2019s positive test.",
      "Andrew Messick, the chief executive of Ironman, the leading organizer of triathlons internationally, described the sport as \u201ca life-changing personal journey, not a win-at-all-cost trophy,\u201d and called Chartier\u2019s positive test \u201can assault on our most fundamental value.\u201d",
      "Other triathlon veterans said that having nearly 20 years pass without a top athlete testing positive had led them to believe that triathlon was somehow different from other sports. An endeavor requiring athletes to swim, cycle and run as many as 140.6 miles, triathlon would figure to be ideally suited for chemically aided performance enhancement. But ",
      " a former long-distance world champion, said most triathletes have long held the view that \u201cthe real race is against yourself.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cFor people focused on being the best version of yourself, cheating doesn\u2019t align with that goal. We\u2019ve never been a big-money sport, so cheating was never really incentivized.\u201d",
      ", the six-time Ironman world champion and one of the sport\u2019s first big stars, put it a little more poetically.",
      "\u201cThe essence of triathlon is personally dreaming about super excellent levels of crazy stuff, but doing it cleanly,\u201d Allen said. \u201cMaybe it is na\u00efve.\u201d",
      "Other elements to Chartier\u2019s positive test and its aftermath have also turned the situation into a major pivot point and cast serious doubt over his performances last year. Chartier, who sought refuge in the mountains of Colorado late last week, said for now he has nothing further to say publicly beyond his Instagram post and ",
      " on which he has been prominently featured during the past year.",
      "On those platforms, Chartier said he began taking EPO in November, following what he deemed a subpar performance at the Ironman world championships. Chartier said he was injured, sick and overwhelmed by the weight of expectations after his victory in the 2022 U.S. Open Cup, which earned him a $100,000 prize. Suspecting that his competitors were cheating, too, he viewed taking EPO as the only way he could compete at the highest level this year. He named no names and said he had no evidence to support his suspicions. He said he acted alone, researching how to take EPO and ordering it on the internet.",
      "Chartier refused to make an \u201cexcuse like a ",
      " or a tainted Covid vaccine,\u201d he wrote on Instagram, derisively referring to previous explanations from other athletes for failed doping tests. \u201cI made a terrible choice, and now it is time to face the consequences, own it and move on.\u201d",
      "As far as the elite competitors and the devotees at the amateur level were concerned, Chartier had pulled the pin on a grenade, tossed it into the sport\u2019s nerve center, then run, swam or cycled away.",
      "Part of that had to do with the claim that he competed cleanly last year, when, after years of mostly unspectacular performances at shorter distances, he won the full Ironman race at Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, in August as well as the Professional Triathletes Organization\u2019s U.S. Open Cup event. The U.S. Open victory in September delivered one of the season\u2019s biggest paydays in a sport where the opportunity to win significant prize money ",
      ". Chartier said he planned to keep the money because he raced clean and did not test positive until February.",
      "\u201cThis is super upsetting for athletes because of what he has stolen in prize money and recognition,\u201d Sodaro said over the weekend. \u201cHe says he wasn\u2019t doping during that period of time, that he started doping after those races and after Kona, but I think a lot of people are finding that pretty hard to believe.\u201d",
      "Part of it also had to do with his claim that he had acted without any guidance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s said no one dopes alone,\u201d Plews said. \u201cI\u2019m a physiologist, and I wouldn\u2019t dope alone.\u201d",
      "That line of thinking has broad ramifications for the sport, especially given how Chartier voiced his suspicions about other elites. Chartier\u2019s coach is Mikal Iden of Norway, whose brother, Gustav, is the reigning Ironman world champion.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not a household name but that association with a household name damages the sport,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.",
      "In an ",
      " last week, Mikal Iden said he was \u201cin shock and crying.\u201d He added, \u201cI can\u2019t distance myself enough from this action. It\u2019s such a complete crash in my values.\u201d",
      "Even triathletes with no direct connection to Chartier have found themselves playing defense.",
      "Days after Chatrier\u2019s positive test result, Sam Laidlow of France pulled out of the P.T.O.\u2019s European Open in Ibiza, Spain, scheduled for this Saturday, citing \u201cpersonal issues\u201d in a social media post, including a move to a new house. Quickly, speculation circulated that a Laidlow positive test could be the next shoe to drop.",
      "\u201cIf people question now a change of plan or me not showing up at a race and straight away put me in a box of being a cheat then that\u2019s messed up,\u201d Laidlow wrote in a follow-up post on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard my whole life and my family and I have invested so much so you can\u2019t say that freely with no foundation.\u201d",
      "Chris Kermode, the former leader of the men\u2019s tennis tour who last year became the executive chairman of the P.T.O., said this was the dynamic he feared more than any other when he took over the organization. With more money than ever now at stake in triathlon, fans and potential sponsors need to know the competition is \u201creal\u201d for the pro circuit to have any chance to grow and succeed.",
      "The outrage within the sport did betray a certain na\u00efvet\u00e9, Kermode said Monday, but also showed the passion elite triathletes have for their endeavor.",
      "\u201cThey were shocked, disgusted, and their message was loud and clear, that this is not endemic in the sport,\u201d Kermode said. \u201cIn cycling, it became something that was no surprise.\u201d",
      "He is determined not to let that happen in triathlon, and intends to have the leading experts in antidoping review his organization\u2019s program.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want ever to be in a position where people can pick holes in what we are doing,\u201d he said."

For what, I don\u2019t know, but we were looking for something,\u201d she said in a 1958 interview. Among the items, she found a red plaid diary. Gies grabbed it and put it in a drawer in her office.",

Walking around the museum and listening to tour guides, they learned that many people ",

She finds employment with Otto Frank (Liev Schreiber) \u2014 a stern, fellow German-speaking immigrant \u2014 and meets her future husband, a social worker. Much of the first episode follows Gies living life as a modern young woman, meeting friends and going out dancing.",

      "\u201cThese people, they had washing machines and toasters. They were living in a modern world and they couldn\u2019t believe, in this modern world that they were living, that these things could happen,\u201d Rater said.",

      "\u201cWhen we started digging, we started putting together these pieces that I don\u2019t know that anybody had ever put together before,\u201d Phelan said. In the course of their research, with the help of a local researcher in the Netherlands, Rater and Phelan discovered that Gies and her husband also helped people hide in their own home, including two nurses.",

The show\u2019s title is taken from a quote by Gies: \u201cEven a regular secretary, a housewife or a teenager can turn on a small light in a dark room.\u201d",

      "Bob Dylan once named Gordon Lightfoot one of his favorite songwriters, and called the musician \u201csomebody of rare talent\u201d while inducting him into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1986. On Dylan\u2019s 1970 album \u201cSelf Portrait,\u201d he even recorded Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cEarly Morning Rain,\u201d and the respect was mutual \u2014 Lightfoot listened carefully to Dylan\u2019s songs, which instilled in him \u201ca more direct approach, getting away from the love songs,\u201d ",
      ".",
      "In an expansive career that drew from Greenwich Village folk and Laurel Canyon pop, Gordon Meredith Lightfoot Jr., who ",
      ", was embraced by a diverse group of musicians: Elvis Presley and Duran Duran, Lou Rawls and the Replacements. He sang in a rueful baritone full of tenacity and an almost professorial air, and specialized in songs that dwelled on solitude, or recounted unhappy relationships, in grounded language that drew on folk and blues modes.",
      "\u201cLightfoot\u2019s is the voice of the romantic,\u201d Geoffrey Stokes of The Village Voice wrote in 1974. \u201cFor him (as for Don Quixote, one of his chosen heroes) perfection is always in view and always slipping from his grasp.\u201d",
      "Nowhere was Lightfoot more beloved than in his native Canada, where he helped transform its music industry into a worldwide force. \u201cHe sent a message to the world that we\u2019re not just a bunch of lumberjacks and hockey players up here,\u201d Geddy Lee of Rush said in \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind,\u201d a 2019 documentary. \u201cWe\u2019re capable of sensitivity and poetry.\u201d In the process, Lightfoot became one of the most successful recording artists of the 1970s.",
      "Here are 10 of Lightfoot\u2019s most beloved and impactful songs.",
      "The folk tradition in which Lightfoot initially worked is full of boastful songs about rambling men who are lighting out for the territory, but this one is uniquely cruel. It\u2019s pushed along by his stout acoustic guitar strumming and David Rea\u2019s sleek fingerpicking accents, which reinforce the lyric\u2019s hauteur. \u201cEverything you have is gone,\u201d Lightfoot tells the woman he\u2019s leaving. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for lovin\u2019 me.\u201d Her broken heart will eventually mend, he adds, at which point \u201cI just might pass this way again.\u201d He later felt some embarrassment about the song, and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what chauvinism was.\u201d",
      "Lightfoot grew up in bucolic Central Ontario, which could hardly be farther from Memphis, but he sounds nearly Southern on this simple, brisk folk song, which Presley recorded a few years later. Its theme is homesickness (Lightfoot was living in Los Angeles when he wrote it); the narrator, who\u2019s \u201cas cold and drunk as I can be,\u201d in addition to broke, watches a 707 fly overhead and envies its freedom as he pines for his hometown.",
      "In this canny depiction of wounded pride, Lightfoot gets together with an old friend to shoot the breeze, but amid the chitchat about sports and mutual acquaintances, he casually slips in a question that reveals his agenda: \u201cBy the way, did she mention my name?\u201d This song and \u201cFor Lovin\u2019 Me\u201d are fraternal twins, joined by their fascination with male pride.",
      "Lightfoot mostly worked the personal-relationship side of folk music and left the political side to others. The controversial \u201cBlack Day in July\u201d has a restless, unsettled drum track, and describes the July 1967 uprisings in Detroit in which Black residents protested police abuse, prompting the governor to send in the National Guard and the president to send in the army. The song is full of irony, scorn and bafflement (\u201cThe soul of Motor City is feared across the land\u201d) and most U.S. radio stations refused to play it.",
      "Lightfoot\u2019s commercial breakthrough (it reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100) is also his masterpiece, with assistance from Nick DeCaro\u2019s cascading string arrangement. The lyrics, inspired by his impending divorce, range from poetic to stark, until he reaches the stoic summary: \u201cStories always end.\u201d The melody inspired Duran Duran\u2019s \u201cSave a Prayer,\u201d and the song has been covered by a who\u2019s who of singers, including Barbra Streisand, Johnny Cash and Neil Young \u2014 and, almost, by Frank Sinatra, who tried to record it but gave up, declaring it \u201ctoo long.\u201d",
      "Lightfoot was an alcoholic and a rounder who knew a lot about tempestuous relationships. He wrote \u201cSundown\u201d while in a jealous fit of fantasy about Cathy Smith, a girlfriend whose cheekbone he once broke during a fight. The lyrics typify his dark, terse romanticism, and the snaking guitar solo is one of the great Red Shea\u2019s finest moments. The song\u2019s been covered by, among others, the goth legends ",
      " and ",
      ".",
      "The mid-70s was Lightfoot\u2019s commercial peak, but this successor to the Top 10 pop hits \u201cSundown\u201d and \u201cCarefree Highway\u201d didn\u2019t get the reception it deserved. The chords and lyrics call to mind Jimmy Webb, as Lightfoot, with his usual precise elocution, celebrates the way loyal friendships give succor to \u201chigh-stepping strutters who land in the gutters.\u201d",
      "His best-known song is one of the most unlikely pop hits: a six-and-a-half-minute folk ballad about a freighter that sank in Lake Superior a year earlier, killing 29 crew members. It\u2019s also surely the only Top 40 song to ever mention Gitche Gumee, the Chippewa name for Lake Superior. The impish rock band NRBQ sometimes played a ",
      ", and if the audience didn\u2019t like it, it would play it a second time as well.",
      "In some of Lightfoot\u2019s lyrics, it\u2019s difficult to tell whether the conflicts he describes are factual or merely byproducts of a suspicious imagination. In this softly scornful song about cheating, which he recorded in 1968 and rerecorded 10 years later, in a superior version, he believes his lover is using a friend\u2019s apartment to carry on an affair, and he implies that he\u2019ll eventually catch her: \u201cThe city where we live might be quite large/But the circle is small.\u201d",
      "In the 1980s, as music moved away from acoustic sounds, Lightfoot chased pop success by using synthesizers, drum machines and the producer David Foster, but he didn\u2019t sound like himself. By the time of \u201cHarmony,\u201d he\u2019d returned to working with the guitarists Shea and Terry Clements. Tobacco use had eaten away at the top of his range, but the title song of his penultimate studio album has a fragile, hard-won tenderness that seems to look back at his career (and his life) with peaceful regret."

      "In a 2021 episode of \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows,\u201d the ancient vampire Nandor goes to Atlantic City and is smitten with a slot machine themed on \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d Later, he\u2019s amazed to discover that \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d is also a TV show. \u201cVery faithful to the slot machine!\u201d he marvels.",
      "There is not yet a series based on a slot machine \u2014 that I know of",
      "But Nandor is on to something: TV today is full of Things Based on Other Things. Films have become TV series (including \u201cShadows,\u201d an adaptation of a 2015 movie), as have books and superhero comics and podcasts and manga and video games.",
      "Nandor is on to something else too. \u201cFaithfulness\u201d has become a watchword for adaptations, sometimes a measure of authenticity, sometimes a billy club to police divergences from a favorite story.",
      "It\u2019s a term that raises a lot of unanswered questions: Faithful to what, or whom? Do fans of the original work have more of a claim on the adaptation than everyone else? Can you be faithful and creative at the same time \u2014 and do people asking for faithfulness even want that? Or do they simply want obedience?",
      "In its recent rebranding presentation, Max (the streaming service now known as HBO Max, which downsizes its name later this month) announced a slate of programming full of Things Based on Other Things. Along with a new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel adapted from novellas by George R.R. Martin, a series version of the horror movie \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d and a \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d spinoff (congrats, Nandor!), Max confirmed plans for a series repurposing one of Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s most valuable properties, the Harry Potter books.",
      "Much of the response focused, understandably, on the news that J.K. Rowling would produce the adaptation despite the controversy \u2014 even ",
      " \u2014 over her criticisms of \u201c",
      "\u201d But another curiosity in Max\u2019s attempt to squeeze more blood from the sorcerer\u2019s stone was its description of the series as \u201ca faithful adaptation.\u201d",
      "Faithful compared with what? The books have already been adapted into eight films, whose adherence to the plots was as tightly monitored as the prison at Azkaban. But with a limited run time and no access to Hermione Granger\u2019s time turner, they had to make cuts. A series, with a ",
      " and each season based on one book, would have the space, in the words of Casey Bloys, the chairman of HBO, to \u201cdive deep,\u201d i.e., to cram in everything on superfans\u2019 ",
      " lists.",
      "More \u201cfaithful,\u201d here, means more exhaustive \u2014 more committed to reproducing, at a healthy budget, the images already inside the reader\u2019s head. And here\u2019s the problem with faith: The aesthetic version, like the religious one, can lead you to higher insight and inspiration, or it can shackle you to the unforgiving literal interpretation of a text.",
      "Adaptations are a devil\u2019s bargain. They are made for a reason, to gain the advantages of brand recognition and a pre-existing audience. But that comes with the burden of expectations: fans of the original checking it against the source, some looking for a fresh take, others looking for a completist video illustration.",
      "Or worse, they use \u201cfaithfulness\u201d as a cover for small-mindedness. See the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d fans who objected to ",
      " to populate Middle-earth, or \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d devotees who knocked the HBO video game adaptation for expanding the story of two gay characters to ",
      ", supposedly on the grounds of \u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the game.\u201d",
      "For a TV critic, the era of adaptations means every review involves new decisions and more supplementary material. Should you read the book, see the movie, play the game? Or should you go in cold, to better represent the many viewers who will come to the material the same way? I\u2019ve done both, but you can never do both at the same time; once I had read the books that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is based on, I couldn\u2019t un-read them.",
      "But this is not your problem. The issue for viewers is that there are more and more series out there serving two audiences, the fans of the original work and the ones coming to the story new.",
      "Here, I\u2019m on the side of the newbies. Good TV can be challenging, but it should never be homework. If you need to have read or seen or heard a prior work to appreciate your show, you have made a bad show. The duties of reproduction (to realize something someone has already created) can be at odds with the duties of art (to create what never was).",
      "True creativity requires not blind faith but a little treachery. The best TV adaptations use the distinctly serial and visual medium to re-create the emotion and spirit of the source, whittling away whatever doesn\u2019t translate. HBO\u2019s \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d hews reasonably close to Elena Ferrante\u2019s plots, but it works as TV because it\u2019s artfully directed and miraculously cast, using image and the nuance of expression to convey the inner lives of its characters without drowning in exposition or voice-over.",
      " the series-length rock bifauxpic on Amazon Prime Video, had an open opportunity to rethink its source material. The novel by ",
      " told the story of a fictional Fleetwood Mac-like supergroup in oral-history form, a device that worked on the page but required rethinking for the screen. As Eleanor Henderson ",
      ", \u201cthe script format inherently limits our access to the characters\u2019 innermost selves.\u201d",
      "Unfortunately, the adaptation by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (\u201c500 Days of Summer\u201d) fills in the gaps with mush. The series devotes a lot of energy to staging key performances and musical moments from the novel (which necessarily left much to the reader\u2019s imagination), but the fleshed-out personal dramas and artistic struggles pile on the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll period clich\u00e9s. The result may be a faithful-enough audio companion to the novel. As stand-alone TV, it plays like a ham-handed \u201cThis Is Us\u201d flashback.",
      "If \u201cDaisy Jones\u201d ends up a listless cover band, Prime Video\u2019s \u201cDead Ringers\u201d is a brilliantly reckless experiment. Its genetic material is the 1988 David Cronenberg body-horror movie (itself based loosely on a novel, which ",
      " echoed ",
      "), about the descent into madness of a pair of twin gynecologists, both played by Jeremy Irons.",
      "The six-episode series reimagines its twin leads, the idealistic obstetrician Beverly Mantle and the ambitious biomedical researcher Elliot Mantle, each so clearly delineated by Rachel Weisz you might forget there\u2019s only one of her.",
      "Gender-flipping the leads reframes the original film\u2019s ideas about the bloody machinery of childbirth \u2014 rooting the story in women\u2019s reality rather than abstract horror \u2014 but the series does so much more. It\u2019s a caustic, absurd comedy, a psychological drama of sibling dependence and a wry take on venture-capital medicine and privilege. (The sisters court an amoral opioid heiress, played by Jennifer Ehle.) Weisz and the writer Alice Birch have created a wondrous monster that firmly answers the questions too many adaptations fumble with: Why bother and why now?",
      "I can\u2019t say the same for Paramount+\u2019s revamp of the 1987 erotic thriller ",
      " with Lizzy Caplan and Joshua Jackson as the principals in an affair that goes criminally wrong. It has good intentions in its update, with Caplan expanding on the problematic, bunny-boiling obsessive played by Glenn Close. But it ends up a tedious, mopey echo of upscale marital dramas like \u201cThe Affair\u201d (which Jackson also appeared in) while being too constrained by the parameters of the original story to go anywhere worthwhile.",
      "It\u2019s fitting, I guess, that a drama about infidelity should fall into the faithfulness trap. In the end, adaptation isn\u2019t a marriage. At best, it\u2019s an open relationship. Faithfulness is a great quality in real life, but when it comes to fiction, betrayal inevitably makes a better story."

      "It was a happy fallout of Covid.",
      "During the pandemic shutdown, the filmmaker ",
      " and his wife, the actress ",
      ", hunkered down in their home on the Marin County coast of California. The photography dealer ",
      " and his husband, Alan Mark, a real-estate consultant, relocated from San Francisco to their weekend house in a neighboring town. The two couples, who knew each other casually, began spending more time together.",
      "One evening, Fraenkel asked if Coen and McDormand were familiar with the work of ",
      " At 88, Friedlander is ",
      " whose pictures Fraenkel has been exhibiting for more than 40 years.",
      "\u201cI thought Lee was ripe for an outside approach and inviting a filmmaker seemed like the way to go,\u201d Fraenkel said of his matchmaking inspiration. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s seen Joel\u2019s movies knows he has a special eye for images.\u201d",
      "Although the subjects of Friedlander\u2019s black-and-white photographs since the early \u201960s have been wide-ranging \u2014 public monuments, motel rooms, party scenes, portraits, self-portraits, nudes and landscapes \u2014 what unites them is his unerring sense of composition. In his ability to create harmonious wholes out of urban fragments, he is the contemporary heir to Eug\u00e8ne Atget, who memorialized Paris in the early 20th century. Like Atget, too, Friedlander finds unexpected juxtapositions in the reflections in plate-glass windows.",
      "The witty and carefully crafted movies that Coen has written and directed \u2014 most with his brother, Ethan, including \u201cBarton Fink,\u201d \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d\u2014 display a similar flair for revealing the mystery in what might seem at first glance to be ordinary and banal.",
      "Fraenkel\u2019s question about Friedlander landed on fertile ground. \u201cI certainly knew of him, and I think Fran did a little,\u201d Coen said recently, in a joint video interview with McDormand from California. \u201cJeffrey floated the idea of doing a show of Lee\u2019s photographs. He said it could be whatever you want. \u2018Just 10 photographs if you like.\u2019 \u201d",
      "Coen and McDormand visited the Friedlanders in New City, N.Y., to make sure they were simpatico. The meeting was a great success. \u201cThey came here with Jeffrey,\u201d Friedlander recalled. \u201cWe were ready for them with food, but they brought food, too. We had a sort of picnic indoors. When Joel and I met, we both thought we might have known each other. We didn\u2019t, but we were so familiar with each other.\u201d",
      "Over the last year, Coen expanded the project into a sequenced book of 70 Friedlander photos, \u201c",
      " that is the basis for two exhibitions, at the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco, from May 6 through June 24, and at ",
      " in New York, from May 13 to June 24. Each show will display about 45 photos.",
      "Coen began by leafing through books of Friedlander pictures and decided to arrange the new book to draw attention to Friedlander\u2019s compositional approaches. \u201cLooking through these books and going back and forth, it was a pattern recognition for me \u2014 patterns which I know are instinctive but are manifold in everything he does,\u201d he said.",
      "He began with the artist\u2019s simplest formal structures and advanced into greater complexity. \u201cThe first thing I noticed was the splitting,\u201d Coen explained. Friedlander repeatedly organizes a picture with a vertical post dividing the frame. \u201cThe post, the post,\u201d Coen continued. \u201cThen I see the posts are slightly diagonal, and the affinity between the diagonal post and how car interiors are designed. Then I see how he uses diagonal shadows like the posts. Now I see how he is using television screens like windows. Now I see how he is using light to define the same areas.\u201d As the book unfolds, the themes and variations become evident.",
      "\u201cBecause he\u2019s a filmmaker, he would show me the sequences on an iPad,\u201d McDormand recalled of the way her husband storyboarded the book.",
      "In addition to the book, Coen created for the two gallery shows what he calls a \u201cflip book\u201d \u2014 a three-and-a-half-minute video of images arranged in an order that highlights these strategies.",
      "To learn what the artist thinks of Coen\u2019s curatorial approach, I traveled to suburban Rockland County on the west side of the Hudson to pay a call on Friedlander and his wife, Maria Friedlander, driving down a wooded road, past an apple orchard, to the rambling 1947 house faced with brown shingle and stone from a local quarry that they have inhabited for over half a century.",
      "Friedlander said he found Coen\u2019s observations intriguing. \u201cI tend to put posts in,\u201d he remarked. \u201cHe says all kinds of nice things that I don\u2019t recognize. Splitting, splintering. Evidently my pictures are that way, but I didn\u2019t think, \u2018I want to take a splintering picture.\u2019 If you\u2019ve done the same thing for 60 years, you don\u2019t think of motive very much. I just walk and see something interesting.\u201d",
      "Friedlander works with film. Unlike a digital photographer, an artist who shoots film doesn\u2019t see the images until the film is processed and printed on contact sheets. Photography thrives on accidents; there can be surprises. \u201cIn one photograph, the reflection looks like part of the building,\u201d Friedlander said of \u201cAlbany, New York, 1967,\u201d a picture that Coen chose for the book. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice until I printed it.\u201d",
      "Friedlander is the most cerebral of photographers, making intricate images marked by divisions, reflections and repetitions; and yet, discussing his work, he insists that none of this is on his mind when he takes the picture. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great game,\u201d he said. \u201cAs complicated as a picture could get, it\u2019s done in 1/100th of a second \u2014 or less.\u201d",
      "When asked about this paradox, Coen said, \u201cI\u2019m extremely sympathetic to Lee\u2019s point of view in how he thinks about his own work. It comes up with any writer, photographer or filmmaker, because you\u2019re always asked to analyze your own process or the obsessions of your own work. I\u2019ve always been very much of the opinion that the obligation of the person who makes the work is to make the work, and the obligation of the people who view the work is to think about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not living retrospectively,\u201d McDormand interjected. \u201cYou\u2019re living alive in the moment, creating something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut when I look at someone else\u2019s work, I take on the mantle of the opposite side of the fence,\u201d Coen continued. \u201cWhether you intended it or not, I\u2019m telling you what I see and what I\u2019m drawn to.\u201d",
      "A still photographer and a filmmaker have very different aims, Coen said. \u201cI take photos with my iPhone like everybody else, but I was looking at a visual form that I have no connection to. The primary thing in cinematography is a narrative, and everything else is secondary. Often the director of photography will set up a shot that is so beautiful but so deficient from a narrative point of view.\u201d And the shot is scrapped.",
      "Coen said that Friedlander\u2019s photographs are animated with his idiosyncratic wit. \u201cThey are extremely cerebral, they are extremely formal,\u201d he explained. \u201cAt the same time, they have a sense of humor, a very delicate one. For that reason, they\u2019re not cold. I love the fact that they\u2019re so complicated that way, but he doesn\u2019t talk about them analytically.\u201d",
      "McDormand is drawn to the long, close marriage of the Friedlanders, who were wed in 1958. \u201cI think Jeffrey was interested in us meeting them,\u201d she said. She remarked that for her, this was a story about three married couples. \u201cThe six of us, we don\u2019t have to do anything we don\u2019t want to do,\u201d she said. She was especially moved by Lee\u2019s portraits of Maria, in particular \u201cMaria, Las Vegas, 1970,\u201d which is also in the new book.",
      "\u201cThere is a tenderness,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the most resonant ones, for both of us, is his shadow across her partially nude body. For me, and then meeting them, that photograph is resonant to their whole relationship.\u201d",
      "Friedlander continues to photograph, and six days a week, he prints from his old negatives in a spacious darkroom he constructed in the basement of his house. \u201cI love working,\u201d he said. The prints he is making now are of the landscapes he photographed 20 years ago in the West \u2014 thick tangles of branches, boulders and pine needles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still shooting the same subjects when I go out west,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more jumble, the better I like them \u2014 if they work. I don\u2019t want to repeat Ansel Adams. It wouldn\u2019t be any fun to do that.\u201d",
      "Images like \u201cAlbany, New York, 1967,\u201d where a woman stands by a post that divides a row of tall buildings from the mirrored reflection of other tall buildings, or \u201cCalifornia, 1970,\u201d with the diagonal struts of Plexiglas pay-phone enclosures interrupting and refracting the city scene, organize urban chaos miraculously. Coen said that as he perused Friedlander\u2019s photographs, he thought at one point, \u201c\u2018These are impossible compositions. How does it happen that these things that seem to be so impossible are so perfect?\u2019 Thinking more about an artist I admire was the whole motivation.\u201d"

      "Gordon Lightfoot, the Canadian folk singer whose rich, plaintive baritone and gift for melodic songwriting made him one of the most popular recording artists of the 1970s, died on Monday night in Toronto. He was 84. ",
      "His death, at Sunnybrook Hospital, was confirmed by his publicist, Victoria Lord. She did not specify a cause, but Mr. Lightfoot had had a number of health problems in recent years.",
      "Mr. Lightfoot, a fast-rising star in Canada in the early 1960s, broke through to international success when his friends and fellow Canadians Ian and Sylvia Tyson recorded two of his songs, ",
      " and ",
      "When Peter, Paul and Mary came out with ",
      " of those songs \u2014 their \u201cFor Lovin\u2019 Me\u201d was a Top 40 hit \u2014 and Marty Robbins reached the top of the country charts with Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s ",
      " Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s reputation soared. Overnight, he joined the ranks of songwriters like Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs and Tom Paxton, all of whom influenced his style.",
      "Mr. Dylan in turn held Mr. Lightfoot in high regard. He once said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of any Gordon Lightfoot song I don\u2019t like,\u201d adding, \u201cEvery time I hear a song of his, it\u2019s like I wish it would last forever.\u201d Mr. Dylan included a version of \u201cEarly Morning Rain\u201d on his 1970 album \u201cSelf Portrait.\u201d (Among the other singers to have covered that song is Elvis Presley.)",
      "When folk music ebbed in popularity, overwhelmed by the British invasion, Mr. Lightfoot began writing ballads aimed at a broader audience. He scored one hit after another, beginning in 1970 with the heartfelt \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind,\u201d inspired by the breakup of his first marriage.",
      "That song \u2014 which begins with the memorable lines \u201cIf you could read my mind, love,/What a tale my thoughts could tell./Just like an old-time movie,/\u2019Bout a ghost from a wishing well\u201d \u2014 reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has been covered by Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Johnny Cash and numerous others.",
      "In quick succession he recorded the hits \u201c",
      "\u201d (his first and only No. 1 single), ",
      " (\u201cLet me slip away, slip away on you\u201d), ",
      " and ",
      " which he wrote after reading an article about the sinking of an iron-ore carrier in Lake Superior in 1975, with the loss of all 29 crew members.",
      "For Canadians, Mr. Lightfoot was a national hero, a homegrown star who stayed home even after achieving spectacular success in the United States and who catered to his Canadian fans with cross-country tours. His ballads on Canadian themes, like ",
      " pulsated with a love for the nation\u2019s rivers and forests, which he explored on ambitious canoe trips far into the hinterlands.",
      "His personal style, reticent and self-effacing \u2014 he avoided interviews and flinched when confronted with praise \u2014 also went down well. \u201cSometimes I wonder why I\u2019m being called an icon, because I really don\u2019t think of myself that way,\u201d Mr. Lightfoot told the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail in 2008. \u201cI\u2019m a professional musician, and I work with very professional people. It\u2019s how we get through life.\u201d",
      "Gordon Meredith Lightfoot Jr. was born on Nov. 17, 1938, in Orillia, Ontario, to Gordon and Jessie Vick (Trill) Lightfoot. His father managed a dry-cleaning plant. As a boy, he sang in a church choir, performed on local radio shows and shined in singing competitions. \u201cMan, I did the whole bit: oratorio work, Kiwanis contests, operettas, barbershop quartets,\u201d he told Time magazine in 1968.",
      "He played piano, drums and guitar as a teenager, and while still in high school wrote his first song, a topical number about the hula hoop craze with a catchy last line: \u201cI guess I\u2019m just a slob and I\u2019m gonna lose my job, \u2019cause I\u2019m hula-hula-hoopin\u2019 all the time.\u201d His attempts to sell it were unsuccessful.",
      "After studying composition and orchestration at the Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles, he returned to Canada. For a time he was a member of the Singing Swinging Eight, a singing and dancing troupe seen on the television show \u201cCountry Hoedown.\u201d But he soon became part of the Toronto folk scene, performing at the same coffee houses and clubs as Ian and Sylvia, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen.",
      "He formed a folk duo, the Two Tones, with a fellow \u201cHoedown\u201d performer, Terry Whelan. The duo recorded a live album in 1962, \u201cTwo Tones at the Village Corner.\u201d The next year, while traveling in Europe, he served as the host of \u201cThe Country and Western Show\u201d on BBC television.",
      "As a songwriter, Mr. Lightfoot had by then advanced beyond the hula hoop, but not by a great deal. His work \u201cdidn\u2019t have any kind of identity,\u201d he told Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, the authors of \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Folk, Country and Western Music,\u201d published in 1969. When the Greenwich Village folk boom brought Mr. Dylan and other dynamic songwriters to the fore, he said, \u201cI started to get a point of view, and that\u2019s when I started to improve.\u201d",
      "In 1965, he appeared at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island and at Town Hall in New York. \u201cMr. Lightfoot has a rich, warm voice and a dexterous guitar technique,\u201d Robert Shelton wrote in The New York Times. \u201cWith a little more attention to stage personality, he should become quite popular.\u201d",
      "A year later, after signing with Albert Grossman, the manager of Mr. Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary, Mr. Lightfoot recorded his first solo album, \u201cLightfoot!\u201d The album, which included ",
      " ",
      " ",
      " and ",
      " a hit in Canada in 1963, was warmly received by critics.",
      "Real commercial success came when he switched to Warner Bros., initially recording for the company\u2019s Reprise label. \u201cBy the time I changed over to Warner Bros., \u2019round about 1970, I was reinventing myself,\u201d he told the Georgia newspaper Savannah Connect in 2010. \u201cLet\u2019s say I was probably just advancing away from the folk era, and trying to find some direction whereby I might have some music that people would want to listen to.\u201d",
      "Accompanying himself on an acoustic 12-string guitar and singing in a voice that often trembled with emotion, Mr. Lightfoot gave spare, direct accounts of his material. He sang of loneliness, troubled relationships, the itch to roam and the majesty of the Canadian landscape. He was, as the Canadian writer Jack Batten put it, \u201cjournalist, poet, historian, humorist, short-story teller and folksy recollector of bygone days.\u201d",
      "His popularity as a recording artist began to wane in the 1980s, but he maintained a busy touring schedule. In 1999 Rhino Records released \u201cSongbook,\u201d a four-disc survey of his career.",
      "Mr. Lightfoot, who lived in Toronto, is survived by his wife, Kim Hasse, six children \u2014 Fred, Ingrid, Miles, Meredith, Eric and Galen \u2014 and several grandchildren. His first two marriages ended in divorce. His older sister, Beverley Eyers, died in 2017.",
      "In 2002, just before going onstage in Orillia, Mr. Lightfoot collapsed when an aneurysm in his abdominal aorta ruptured and left him near death. After he spent two years recovering, he recorded an album, \u201cHarmony,\u201d and in 2005 he resumed his live performances with what was billed as the Better Late Than Never Tour.",
      "He suffered a minor stroke in 2006 that temporarily affected his ability to play guitar, but he continued touring. Ten years later he performed 80 concerts and told The Canadian Press, \u201cAt this age, my challenge is doing the best show I can.\u201d But just last month, he announced that he was canceling all his scheduled concerts for health reasons.",
      "In an interview with the CBC in 2004, Mr. Lightfoot said he wanted to be like Willie Nelson and other veteran performers: \u201cJust do it for as long as humanly possible.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\u201d his 1976 folk ballad, was unusual partly because, at more than six minutes long, it was about twice as long as most pop hits. It also retold a real-life tragedy \u2014 the 1975 sinking on Lake Superior of ",
      " \u2014 with meticulous attention to detail.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a documentarian\u2019s song, when you think about it,\u201d said Eric Greenberg, a longtime friend of the singer who interviewed Mr. Lightfoot as a student journalist in the late 1970s and later ",
      " with him.",
      "The plotline of a typical Top 40 hit usually consists of \u201cboy meets girl, boy breaks up with girl, or come back, or you left me, or whatever,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said, speaking by phone from New York City. \u201cNot a five-, six-, seven-minute story \u2014 a factual story, in Gordon\u2019s case, painstakingly checked to make sure that all the facts are right.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the true story that inspired \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\u201d and a look at the song that kept its memory alive.",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald was a 729-foot ore carrier and one of the largest freighters on the Great Lakes when it left Superior, Wis., on Nov. 9, 1975, carrying iron pellets bound for Detroit.",
      "The next day, the ship was caught in a storm with winds that averaged 60 to 65 miles an hour. Its captain reported 20- to 25-foot waves washing over the decks and water pouring in below deck through two broken air vents.",
      "That night, the Edmund Fitzgerald ",
      ", in water that was only about 50 degrees. A nearby ship reported seeing its lights disappear in the driving snow.",
      "The Coast Guard later found lifeboats, life rings and other debris from the ship. But the lifeboats were self-inflatable, so their discovery did not necessarily indicate that they had been used. None of the 29 crew members survived.",
      "The morning after the Fitzgerald went down, the rector of Mariners\u2019 Church of Detroit tolled its bell 29 times, once for each man lost. An Associated Press reporter knocked on the church\u2019s door, interviewed the rector and filed an account that was published in newspapers.",
      "Mr. Lightfoot read the article. Soon afterward, he started singing a song about the wreck during a previously scheduled recording session. His band joined in, and the first version of the song that they recorded was later released, according to ",
      " a 2020 documentary.",
      "There was no expectation that the song would become a hit single, because its length made it too long for airplay on the radio. But it would spend 21 weeks on the Billboard charts and ",
      ", one notch behind Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s only No. 1 hit, \u201cSundown.\u201d It also turned the tale of the sinking into a modern legend.",
      "Yet unlike songs that use a real-life story as the basis for embellishment, Mr. Lightfoot\u2019s ballad hewed precisely to the real-life details. The weight of the ore, for example \u2014 \u201c26,000 tons more than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty\u201d \u2014 was accurate. So was the number of times that the church bell chimed in Detroit.",
      "Decades later, Mr. Lightfoot ",
      " the lyrics slightly after investigations into the accident revealed that waves, not crew error, had led to the shipwreck. In the new lyrics, he sang that it got dark at 7 that November night on Lake Superior \u2014 not that a main hatchway caved in.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of meticulous, looking-for-the-truth kind of guy that he was,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said.",
      "\u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\u201d like its ",
      ", endured as a Canadian classic long after slipping off the Top 40 charts. The ",
      " (who also released an entire album of Lightfoot cover songs) and the rock bands Rheostatics and the Dandy Warhols were among those who",
      "sang covers over the years.",
      "\u201cThe melodies are so powerful and he\u2019s such a good storyteller and such a beautiful lyricist,\u201d the Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan said in the 2020 documentary. \u201cAnd the combination of those things just really makes for a great song.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lightfoot remained proud of it for decades, and he kept newspaper clippings and items given to him by the crew members\u2019 surviving families in his home, Mr. Greenberg said.",
      "The song\u2019s success had one downside: It turned the wreck, which lies in Canadian territory at a depth of about 500 feet, ",

      "The fifth largest city in the world, S\u00e3o Paulo is not only the richest urban center in Brazil: It is a rhizome fed by conflicting moral, ethical and aesthetic ambitions and imaginations, which lead and influence an entire country\u2019s cultural production.",
      "Absorbing, concentrating, dominating and replicating other collective imaginations in an ongoing colonizing project, today S\u00e3o Paulo is, for better or worse, the place where many decisions are made about what Brazilian cultural identity and Brazilian culture are understood to be. This causes an important number of artists from all over Brazil to migrate here. Among them are writers \u2014 including the young Black and Indigenous writers whose fictional narratives are, increasingly, and in ways not yet fully understood, opposing this colonizing project in ambitious ways, with language and characters that would have been unacceptable a few years ago.",
      "Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Evaristo\u2019s powerful first novel, \u201c",
      ",\u201d translated by Paloma Martinez-Cruz, addresses the emotional impact of structural racism on Black Brazilian people. The eponymous main character, Ponci\u00e1, grows up in a small town, Vila Vic\u00eancio, in a Black family working on a small subsistence farm. Her grandfather had been enslaved. Facing racism, Ponci\u00e1 takes a train to the big city to find a new life. The name of the city is not mentioned, but there is no doubt it is S\u00e3o Paulo.",
      "The S\u00e3o Paulo explored in the literature of the 21st century, as in Evaristo\u2019s novel, is a space in which extreme situations unfold under a regime of oppression directed against those who are outside privileged social groups. This, in a dystopian way, is very well addressed by the writer Ign\u00e1cio de Loyola Brand\u00e3o in his novel \u201c",
      ",\u201d in a translation by Ellen Watson. In this work of speculative fiction, set in a future S\u00e3o Paulo, \u201cthe System\u201d governs its subjects\u2019 every movement and thought.",
      "Another important author for understanding S\u00e3o Paulo, and Brazil, is Carolina Maria de Jesus. Among her books, \u201c",
      ",\u201d in a translation by David St. Clair, stands out. De Jesus was a contemporary of the world-renowned novelist ",
      ", whose works capture that other important Brazilian city, Rio de Janeiro. There is an interesting dialectic between these two great writers that reveals Brazilian subjectivities.",
      "While it may not have the natural beauty of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo is a metropolis where encounters, conviviality and affection are fostered by its parks, theaters, museums, cultural spaces, cinemas, restaurants and bookstores. I cannot imagine S\u00e3o Paulo without the charm of its bookshops.",
      "I live a few yards away from what I consider the best bookstore in town: the ",
      " in Vila Madalena, in the western part of S\u00e3o Paulo. It stocks nearly exclusively books by independent publishers. More than a place that sells books, it\u2019s also a bar where you can find cheap beer and the best pastel de carne, a kind of ",
      " (it\u2019s hard to explain in a few words the magical experience of eating a Brazilian pastel). It is a place where concerts, readings and debates take place. It is where the newest generation of writers, as well as more established and acclaimed writers, can be found.",
      "Another bookstore that deserves your attention is ",
      ", run by the writer Ferr\u00e9z \u2014 a bookstore that serves a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of S\u00e3o Paulo.",
      ", on Avenida Paulista, a major avenue lined with big glass buildings housing banks and cultural centers, has perhaps the largest collection of books by Brazilian authors translated into English, including a great collection of children\u2019s books and art books about Brazil and Brazilian culture written in English.",
      "There\u2019s also ",

The building itself is well worth visiting: It was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, the architect who also designed the country\u2019s capital, Bras\u00edlia, and the United Nations building in New York. His thoughts and impressions of Brazil and S\u00e3o Paulo can be found in his memoir, \u201c",

      "And there\u2019s more. ",
      " offers the best home delivery options in town. ",
      " only sells books written by women, including Sueli Carneiro, one of the most important Brazilian thinkers, as well as Andr\u00e9a del Fuego, Eliana Alves Cruz and Cidinha da Silva, three of the most celebrated Brazilian writers in recent years. And ",
      ", which is run by the poet Eduardo Lacerda and his wife, Pricila Gunutzmann, belongs to Patu\u00e1, perhaps the most important independent publishing house in Brazil.

      ",\u201d by Micheliny Verunschk, both of which are winners of the Pr\u00eamio S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the three most important literary prizes in Brazil.",
      "Also in the historic center of S\u00e3o Paulo, a few steps from Edif\u00edcio Copan, is the M\u00e1rio de Andrade Library, the first and main public library in the city, which houses an important collection as well as a theater and study and meeting spaces. M\u00e1rio de Andrade was an important Brazilian writer who, among other fundamental works, wrote the foundational work of Brazilian Modernism, the poetry collection \u201c",
      ",\u201d which explores the increasingly urban and chaotic metropolis.",
      "Also close to my house is the Alceu Amoroso Lima Public Library, which is the only large public library in Brazil dedicated exclusively to poetry. There you can find many poetry books by Brazilian authors translated into English \u2014 for example, \u201c",
      ",\u201d by Ang\u00e9lica Freitas, whose work is an example of how some of the best Brazilian poetry today is being written by women and transgender authors. The English translation of the book, by Hilary Kaplan, was a deserving winner in 2016 of the ",
      " given by Three Percent, the literary magazine of Open Letter Books, and the ",
      ", given by the American Literary Translators Association.",
      "Another library that cannot be missed is the ",

      "I can\u2019t talk about S\u00e3o Paulo without mentioning its parks, in particular: Ibirapuera, Villa-Lobos and \u00c1gua Branca. Ibirapuera Park, with its concert venues, planetarium, library, museums and exhibition spaces, is a favorite of residents of the city. If there is time to visit just one of the city\u2019s many parks, make it Ibirapuera.",
      "In Villa-Lobos Park, you\u2019ll find one of the most modern libraries in S\u00e3o Paulo. The park itself is part of an environmental recovery project on the west side of the city.",
      "Originally designed for agricultural research and animal exhibitions, \u00c1gua Branca Park, one of the oldest parks in S\u00e3o Paulo, is home to one of the city\u2019s main organic farmer\u2019s markets. It also has a reading space with children\u2019s books.

      ",\u201d by Juli\u00e1n Fuks, which won awards in Brazil and abroad.",
      "One more note: Do get around the city using the public transport system. S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s subway, trains and buses are the best in Brazil. Much more of the city \u2014 this city that is so complex and exciting \u2014 will be revealed as you travel.",

You blink and the skyline changes. (Blame the developers.) Even as it grows increasingly apparent that Miami will be gobbled up by the sea, a new wave of transplants is ever en route.",
      "Miami residents who were \u201cmade in Dade\u201d carry their heritage on their sleeves, and it informs their writing beautifully. But some of the best stories set in Miami begin elsewhere: in Puerto Rico and Cuba, the Deep South and New England. I expect this will continue to be the case. Even now, a Californian couple is conceiving the Miami writer who will begin his novel, \u201cMy people escaped Palo Alto.\u201d",

There\u2019s much trauma in these pages, but also much triumph, including in the fact that this book came to exist.

Not surprisingly, the Gulf has shaped Kerala\u2019s culture and literature. The territory sits between the Indian Ocean and the Western Ghats, the mountain range that runs parallel to the coast.

For centuries, Arab sailors caught the southwesterlies in the lateen sails of their dhows to come to the \u201cSpice Coast.\u201d When the winds reversed, they carried their purchases of pepper, clove, cardamom, ginger and cinnamon back to Venice or Genoa, where they sold them for small fortunes.

      ". Now Rosen gives us the exquisitely fine print, drawing from clips, court and police records, legal and medical studies, interviews, diaries and some of Laudor\u2019s own feverish compositions, as he examines the porous line between brilliance and insanity and the complicated policy questions posed by deinstitutionalization.",
      "\u201cI grew up surrounded by people who wrote things down,\u201d he notes with understatement, \u201cand wrote things down myself.\u201d",
      "The two men were raised Jewish and bookish in the suburb of New Rochelle, N.Y., advertised on train platforms as \u201cForty-five minutes from Broadway.\u201d It was an incubator to a surprising number of cultural big shots, including E.L. Doctorow, Norman Rockwell, Don McLean and Cynthia Ozick, the author\u2019s mother\u2019s best friend.",
      "\u201cThe same expectation shaping his life was shaping mine,\u201d Rosen writes of Laudor. \u201cThe belief that your brain is your rocket ship and that simply as a matter of course you are going to climb inside and blast off.\u201d",
      "They both aspired to be writers, but Jonathan was always a little in the shadow of Michael, who was only slightly taller but far more confident and popular: reading megafast, \u201c\u2018inhaling\u2019 a page the way he inhaled a pizza,\u201d unafraid of drugs, girls or swimming the entire length of a lake.",

More than one flew over the cuckoo\u2019s nest.",

      "Overseen by anxious adult intellectuals for whom the Holocaust was a fresh and personal memory, the two youths competed for the editorship of their public school newspaper, attended a \u201cnerd camp\u201d on scholarship and propelled themselves to Yale for college. ",

      " and proceeded to Berkeley in a 1968 Volvo to pursue a Ph.D. in English literature. Laudor started a job at Bain & Company, the high-pressure management consultancy, to stockpile a cash cushion before beginning his writing career. There, the intensity and imagination he\u2019d always displayed boiled over into paranoia and delusions. A secretary seemed to grow claws and flash bloody teeth; he worried that the phones were tapped and grew convinced his parents had been murdered and replaced by surgically altered Nazis.",
      "\u201cThe break,\u201d as Rosen writes, \u201cwas not orthopedic.\u201d ",
      "Laudor still aced his LSATs. After hospitalization, his pride hurt by a doctor\u2019s suggestion that he try cashiering at Macy\u2019s, he enrolled at Yale\u2019s law school and, in The Times, revealed himself as a \u201cflaming schizophrenic,\u201d quickly lauded as an advocate of mental-health accommodations.",

      "Laudor\u2019s 80-page book proposal (which Rosen mines, along with another writer\u2019s unfilmed screenplay) was for the power agent Tina Bennett and contained elements of bildungsroman, philosophical treatise, science fiction and spy thriller. But his life, and that of Costello, a gentle supporter and computer whiz who worked in education, would soon tip into bloody horror. Found unfit to stand trial, he was sent to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital.",
      "Rosen cannot release Laudor, but he has rehabilitated and rehumanized him on the page while honoring his victim. \u201cThe Best Minds\u201d is too a thoughtfully built, deeply sourced indictment of a society that prioritizes profit, quick fixes and happy endings over the long slog of care. \u201cIt turned out that going to the moon was easier than curing, preventing or even providing adequate treatment for illnesses that doctors, not so long before, had referred to as lunacy,\u201d he writes, in rueful continuation of the rocket-ship metaphor.",
      "Effectively taking over his friend\u2019s unfinished project, braiding it with his own story of clinical anxiety as well as skeins of history, medicine, religion and true crime, the author has transcended childhood rivalry by twinning their stories, an act of tremendous compassion and a literary triumph.",
      "\u201cEvery review felt like a public colonoscopy,\u201d Rosen writes of his first novel\u2019s reception. In this brave and nuanced book, I could not find so much as a polyp.",

      "Old family stories are hard to revivify, even when they\u2019re good family stories. Nothing fades faster, and is more elusive, than the motivations of people who lived a long time ago, unless they were famous enough to leave a churning wake behind them or wrote honest, plucky memoirs of their own.",
      "This is the problem Ava Chin is up against in her sensitive, ambitious, well-reported, heavily peopled yet curiously remote memoir-cum-history, \u201cMott Street: A Chinese American Family\u2019s Story of Exclusion and Homecoming.\u201d It\u2019s a book that has everything going for it except that intangible spark that crisp and confident storytelling throws off. The air is a bit still in this book, as if one is walking behind the docent on a long museum tour.",
      "Chin\u2019s memoir takes its title from the narrow north-south road in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown that\u2019s generally thought of as its Main Street, to which Chin\u2019s family has a long and intricate and prosperous connection. Members of both sides were born, established businesses, ate, drank and died there. Many lived in the same building.",
      "When she\u2019s on Mott Street, Chin feels she\u2019s at home \u2014 except when she feels like an out-and-out alien (she can\u2019t decide) because she and her mother were abandoned by her father and driven from the home place.",
      "Chin grew up in Flushing, Queens, before its Chinese-immigrant population surpassed that of Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. She was a latchkey kid, raised in part by her grandparents. She was among the few Asians in her schools.",
      "She began to sense that there was a side of her family that no one talked about. \u201cMott Street\u201d opens with her meeting her long-distant father, a wealthy lawyer and handsome former politician named Stanley Chin. About him, Chin\u2019s grandmother had told her, \u201cHe used your mother, then threw her away.\u201d",
      "Father and daughter never establish much of a connection, but the author begins to pull other threads of her family\u2019s past and present. A lot of material comes loose.",
      "\u201cMott Street\u201d is a big book that scrutinizes four generations of her family\u2019s life. It has a great deal to say about the Chinese experience in this country: the perilous journeys here, the racism that forced many into menial railroad and laundry jobs, and the draconian Chinese exclusion laws that for six decades (1882-1943) halted most legal immigration and blocked Chinese people from citizenship.",
      "The story has a certain pageantry. It flexes to absorb world wars, cholera epidemics,",
      "the San Francisco earthquake (the loss of official documents in flattened buildings was a boon to many Chinese immigrants), sensational crimes, foot binding and the rise of urban tongs, warring social groups that some would compare to the mafia.",
      "There is a roll call of American politicians who hurt, and helped, the Chinese American cause. There is a great deal of writing about the consolations of food \u2014 the author\u2019s previous book was \u201cEating Wildly: Foraging for Life, Love and the Perfect Meal\u201d (2014) \u2014 and an analysis of how American Jews became so fond of Chinese cuisines. ",
      "There are so many relatives in these pages that readers will find themselves frequently referring to the family tree in front. A few primary faces emerge.",
      "One is Chin On, the author\u2019s paternal great-grandfather, who arrived here in the 1890s. He had swagger, the \u201ckind of arrogance and flair that would later become known as a distinctively Chin quality,\u201d Chin writes.",
      "He was a violent, amoral, heavy-drinking man, a gambling high-roller who owned or co-owned nightclubs and pool halls and opium dens and brothels. Woe to those who borrowed money from him and could not pay it back. One of Chin On\u2019s heavies carried a hatchet and, in Sweeney Todd fashion, was \u201cnever hesitant to turn an enemy of the family into human pork.\u201d The toxic male may be on the run in America, but as dramatis personae he remains a close-to-indispensable spice.",
      "Excellent to read about, too, is Wu Doshim, a maternal relative. Around the turn of the last century he edited The Chinese Reform Weekly News, one of the first Chinese-language newspapers in New York. He had to work linguistic miracles because he had only about 7,000 pieces of metal type in Chinese, while most metropolitan Chinese papers used more than 30,000. He must have felt the way Georges Perec did when he wrote a novel without using the letter \u201ce.\u201d",
      "The women tended to leave less plentiful paper trails, but Chin painstakingly brings several to life. One is Wu Doshim\u2019s wife, Cheung To Chun, who was a member of the darker-skinned and persecuted Hakka ethnic group. Chun experienced racism at the hands of other Chinese Americans,",
      "and lived most her life here undocumented.",
      "Another is Elva Lisk, the white daughter of a Civil War veteran who married into Chin\u2019s maternal family. Elva had both male and female sex organs, Chin writes. Here and throughout the book, Chin places imagined dialogue, in italics, into her text. (There are imagined sex scenes as well.) This dialogue verges on the mawkish: \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      "\u201d; \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "This memoir evokes emotion but, as with the made-up dialogue, Chin sometimes doesn\u2019t trust her readers to absorb it on their own. She dots painful historical scenes with commentary \u2014 \u201cdrives me bonkers,\u201d \u201cI want to throttle the immigration officers,\u201d \u201cI am grieving\u201d \u2014 after these moments have already spoken plainly.",
      "\u201cMott Street\u201d takes us to the present moment. She recalls the American president who referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cKung Flu\u201d and \u201cChina virus.\u201d She charts the uptick in anti-Asian violence in the United States, and she writes about her life in New York City, and her new fear of subways:",
      "These days, I only travel aboveground.",
      "I carry a flashlight with me at all times, and I wear only shoes and clothing that I can run in, or drop-kick someone in, if attacked.",
      "I practice my squats and my daily push-ups on the ferry to my studio to strengthen my arms and my core, and I advise other Asians to do the same. (I even started a self-defense group, Sisters in Self-Defense, with artist Alison Kuo in order to help community members learn how to protect themselves.)",
      "She and her vibrant family have come so far, but a lot of the old bruises are still right there on the surface.",

      "Activities that we tend to think of as distinctly human often have nothing to do with immediate survival. We brush paint on canvases, we play tunes on instruments, we imagine a world that doesn\u2019t exist and read about the fictitious people who live there. But sometimes the human pursuit of joy and pleasure can create destruction. We have a hard time abiding by the concept of enough. We recklessly and relentlessly chase things we want but do not need.",
      "In \u201cThe Ugly History of Beautiful Things,\u201d Katy Kelleher writes about the extreme and sometimes hideous lengths that people have gone to in order to obtain coveted objects of beauty: ruining their health, wrecking the planet, inflicting suffering on others. As someone with a history of depression that has entailed self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she says that beauty has helped provide the purpose to keep her going: \u201cThe hope for beauty makes me leave my bed each morning rather than moldering in the sheets until I develop bedsores.\u201d",
      "Yet the beauty she seeks is also tied up with feelings of guilt. \u201cI\u2019ve never found an object that was untouched by the depravity of human greed or unblemished by the chemical undoings of time,\u201d Kelleher writes. She buys trinkets and generates garbage. A journalist who writes about home and design, she realizes that it has been her job to encourage others to do the same.",
      "Thankfully, this book isn\u2019t her penance \u2014 it\u2019s more surprising and ambivalent than that, and there isn\u2019t any scolding here, even if some of what she recounts is disturbing and truly horrific. Kelleher points out that an element of ugliness can be part of an object\u2019s appeal, distinguishing between the intriguingly beautiful and the boringly pretty. There is, of course, the Japanese notion of wabi-sabi, which holds that imperfection can be a reminder of life\u2019s impermanence and contingency; a decaying flower might convey another layer of experience that a fresh bloom won\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t explicitly mention Japanese aesthetics, but a chapter on the Nazi fetish for gleaming white porcelain had me rereading Tanizaki\u2019s \u201cIn Praise of Shadows,\u201d in which he writes about wanting a toilet made of black lacquered wood.",
      "But an ugly history is different. Knowledge of it can detract from an object\u2019s allure even as it signals the object\u2019s desirability \u2014 making it glaringly clear how rare something is, and therefore how scarcity has helped to determine its value. In the 19th century, an orchid hunter might have been eaten by a tiger or disappeared forever somewhere in the jungle thicket. During the Renaissance, Venetian glassmakers often worked with toxic materials like lead and mercury; those who didn\u2019t go mad from the vapors or die from mysterious stomach ailments would still have to worry about being assassinated by glassmaking rivals or, should they try to emigrate, by their autocratic rulers.",
      "The mirrors that these glassmakers so painstakingly created have since achieved the status of mass-produced goods, part of a system that has eliminated some hazards while generating others. Mirrors used to be rare and prized enough to be associated with scrying and magic; now, Kelleher laments, they\u2019re so common that they\u2019re taken for granted, or else derided as mere objects of vanity instead of marvelous contraptions that allowed for the \u201csense of awe\u201d that comes with seeing oneself.",
      "Kelleher organizes her book by object, with chapters on gemstones (shadowed by violence), on makeup (shadowed by toxicity), on perfume (shadowed by animal excretions), among others. She has a knack for nimbly threading together her own memories and tastes with the histories of the objects themselves. She doesn\u2019t want cruelty in her goods, and so she fills vases with foraged greenery and buys a silk dress secondhand. \u201cI wanted to feel a fabric that skims over my skin like breeze,\u201d she explains. \u201cHave you ever slipped a silk robe around your body and felt it brush against your nipples?\u201d",
      "Most people in the world would undoubtedly answer no; silk is still a luxury good, even if it\u2019s been made more accessible by exploitative labor practices. Kelleher wrestles with some of these knotty issues, though her enthusiasm is most palpable when she is writing about the goods themselves. We yearn for beautiful things that give us sensual pleasure \u2014 that seems obvious enough. But a luxury good \u201cwas never intended to be available to everyone,\u201d she writes \u2014 that also seems obvious. So what are the implications of this? Not everyone who wants to feel the caress of a silk robe can afford it, especially if it\u2019s ethically made. Should you rein in your desires? Or does that amount to letting the elite off the hook: They do what they wish, while the rest of us make do with what we can get?",
      "It\u2019s a lot of pressure to put on a flimsy robe, but as Kelleher knows, you can\u2019t write about this stuff without at least gesturing at the bigger stuff: existence and mortality, capitalism and consumption. By the end of the book, she comes to a d\u00e9tente with her own yearning. She recognizes that she can appreciate beauty without possessing it \u2014 she can take her daughter to the beach and make mandalas out of shell fragments; she can go for a walk and spot a monarch butterfly in a field or a pink orchid in a bog. But she admits that she still longs for a fantasy home with marble countertops and slate tiles, even if her conscience and her bank account make it an impossibility.",
      "\u201cEach beauty I find will fade, degrade, break and tarnish,\u201d Kelleher writes, \u201cand there\u2019s no point in asking for what I can\u2019t have.\u201d",

      " \u2014 a date that marked the fiery, deadly end of the 51-day standoff between the F.B.I. and David Koresh at his Branch Davidian compound near Waco.",
      "Along with the standoff at ",
      ", in 1992, Waco became a galvanizing moment for the radical right. Exactly two years later, on the morning of ",
      ", Timothy McVeigh drove a Ryder truck loaded with a 7,000-pound fertilizer bomb to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. He lit the fuse, parked the truck and walked to his getaway car in a nearby alley. The blast sheared off the front third of the building, killing 167 people, 19 of them children. (Another victim, a rescue worker, was killed by falling debris.) Among the dead were 15 preschoolers who had just started their morning at the day care center on the second floor.",
      "After white nationalists helped put Trump in the White House, McVeigh\u2019s attack was featured in books by ",
      " and ",
      ", who have convincingly depicted Oklahoma City as both a culmination and a turning point. McVeigh was a decorated veteran of Operation Desert Storm who drew his bombing plans directly from ",
      " a 1978 novel by a neo-Nazi that narrated a lurid fantasy of race war. He referred to his attack as a \u201cmilitary action\u201d and attended militia meetings. Contrary to media portrayals of him at the time, McVeigh wasn\u2019t just some lone-wolf drifter or survivalist oddball. He was steeped in an ideology; he was motivated by a political movement.",
      "Jeffrey Toobin\u2019s \u201cHomegrown\u201d adds to this chorus, but where those other books contain a chapter on Oklahoma City, the entirety of Toobin\u2019s book is given over to McVeigh and the ensuing trials. Toobin covered the legal proceedings for The New Yorker, and he admits that like other journalists he got caught up in \u201cthe trail of evidence presented in the courtroom,\u201d instead of stepping back to grasp McVeigh\u2019s \u201cplace in the broader slipstream of American history.\u201d",
      "Part of the reason, he suggests, lies with how the government decided to prosecute the case \u2014 or, more specifically, how Merrick Garland, the official sent by the Justice Department to supervise the case, decided to prosecute it. Garland was so intent on pruning away anything resembling \u201cclutter\u201d that \u201cthe idea took hold that the bombing was just about Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols,\u201d McVeigh\u2019s co-conspirator.",
      "The first half of the book recounts the events leading up to the bombing in Toobin\u2019s unfussy prose. We read about McVeigh\u2019s \u201ctroubled, but hardly extraordinary upbringing\u201d near Buffalo \u2014 divorced parents (\u201chis rage at his mother was intense\u201d), a father whose job at a radiator plant became increasingly precarious. Toobin describes an arrogant, lonely kid who constantly deflected responsibility, loath to own up to his failures. By the time he met Nichols during basic training in 1988, McVeigh had already found the two things that would provoke in him a fanatical devotion: \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d and guns.",
      "McVeigh would go on to become a regular at gun shows, eventually cajoling Nichols into robbing a dealer so that they could fund their bombing plot. Oklahoma City would be their response to Ruby Ridge, to Waco, to the assault weapons ban of 1994. (McVeigh compared the ban to \u201cthe Cohen Act,\u201d the gun control law in \u201cThe Turner Diaries.\u201d) In other words, the federal government made them do it: McVeigh, who wanted to take credit for the attack while also wanting to be acquitted, at one point urged his legal team to pursue a \u201cnecessity defense\u201d by arguing that the bombing was done to prevent greater harm.",
      "\u201cThe argument was worse than nonsensical,\u201d Toobin writes. \u201cIt was offensive.\u201d McVeigh\u2019s lawyers recognized as much. But all kinds of absurd ideas were entertained by the members of his legal team because they had an essentially unlimited budget, at government expense; the procedure-obsessed Garland wanted to pre-empt any criticism that McVeigh\u2019s right to a robust defense had been compromised.",
      "\u201cHomegrown\u201d repeatedly draws a \u201cdirect line\u201d (as promised on the jacket copy) between the Oklahoma City bombing and the insurrection on Jan. 6; at multiple points Toobin interrupts his brisk narrative with some galumphing sentences reminding the reader of parallels that are glaringly obvious. The more intriguing parts of the book come from his descriptions of all the legal wrangling, much of it informed by 635 boxes of case files donated by Stephen Jones, McVeigh\u2019s showboating attorney, to the University of Texas in 1999. Toobin describes how the lawyer and his client grew to dislike and mistrust each other. After McVeigh criticized Jones in \u201cAmerican Terrorist,\u201d a book by two Buffalo News reporters, Jones claimed \u201ca right to defend himself by disclosing his client\u2019s confidences.\u201d",
      "Still, the lawyer who interests Toobin most is Garland \u2014 another point in the \u201cdirect line\u201d between Oklahoma City and Jan. 6. Back then, Garland was a top official in the Justice Department; now, of course, he is the attorney general of the United States. Toobin, ",
      ", calls him \u201ca reticent, cautious person\u201d who was haunted by the \u201cundignified spectacle\u201d of the O.J. Simpson trial (which Toobin wrote a ",
      " about).",
      "Vowing that the Oklahoma City trials would never devolve into silly theatrics, Garland wanted the case to hew as closely to McVeigh and Nichols as possible. So the prosecution \u201cactively discouraged the idea that McVeigh and Nichols represented something broader \u2014 and more enduring \u2014 than just their own malevolent behavior,\u201d Toobin writes. \u201cThis was a dangerously misleading impression.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if Toobin were addressing his book to Garland, as a cautionary tale, even if Garland\u2019s legal strategy in Oklahoma ultimately proved successful: McVeigh was ",
      " and executed in June 2001; Nichols was sentenced to ",
      ".",
      "Besides, if Merrick Garland had sounded an alarm, would that really have had a transformative effect on the American public? Even Toobin has to concede that the 1990s felt like a very different time: \u201cAmerica was thriving, so how could McVeigh be anything except a regrettable oddity in this moment of national repose?\u201d The fringe was still the fringe \u2014 it was too extreme, too weird, too atomized to coalesce into anything that could get its hands on actual power. Social media didn\u2019t exist; Trump was still known primarily for his florid love life and gaudy casinos. Chilling what-ifs have since become routine facts in our warped reality: \u201cMcVeigh would talk about his belief that an \u2018Army\u2019 of fellow believers was somewhere out there, but he admitted that he never figured out how to reach them.\u201d",

      "Shuffling out into a damp, black English night toward a muddy pond in the year 1995, a kid bears the weight of the world on his shoulders. That, plus a real rucksack stuffed with flint rocks. This is Shy, a drum-and-bass-obsessed boy with behavioral problems, and a protagonist in whom myth and bathos slyly collide.",
      "After having \u201csprayed, snorted, smoked, sworn, stolen, cut, punched, run, jumped, crashed an Escort, smashed up a shop, trashed a house, broken a nose, stabbed his stepdad\u2019s finger,\u201d Shy now presents as a punished teenage Atlas, carrying this \u201cheavy bag of sorry\u201d \u2014 not a ballast to hold up the heavens, but a weight to sink him to possible death.",
      "Shy\u2019s disordered, multidimensional consciousness careens through Max Porter\u2019s brief and brilliant fourth book, a bravura, extended-mix of a novel that skitters, pulses, fractures and coalesces again with all the exhilaration and doom of broken beats and heavy bass lines. It\u2019s best read in one deranging sitting.",
      "The ostensible setting is an institution called Last Chance, a boarding school for troubled boys in a dilapidated old house in the countryside. With uncharacteristically printable eloquence, the usually profane Shy sees the building as being \u201chunched over the garden like a chunk of grumpy history.\u201d Despite the best efforts of the saintly-patient staff, it\u2019s a grim place, not least because \u201cthe boys just rip and rip at each other, endless patterns of attack and response, like flirting\u2019s grim twin.\u201d",
      "The book\u2019s true setting, however, is the sprawling, shifting terrain of Shy\u2019s mind. Though the novel\u2019s time frame is just a few hours of one night, it\u2019s a night of \u201ca shattered flicker-drag of these sense-jumbled memories\u201d and one in which \u201cthe solid world dissolves then coheres like broken sleep, and he shambles into it, remembering.\u201d In other words, the night\u2019s as big as Shy\u2019s life.",
      "Porter moves nimbly between the voices of Shy\u2019s universe as they replay in his memory. They include his long-suffering mum and stepfather; a painfully kind counselor called Jenny; his mate Benny, with whom he wants to start a label, Atomic Bass Recordings; and Amanda, a live-in staff member who \u201csits in her dungarees with her mug of tea and hears whatever the boys want to tell her.\u201d",
      "Part of the novel\u2019s poignancy is that Shy himself doesn\u2019t talk much (clue\u2019s in the name). We\u2019re privy to the churn of his unvoiced thoughts, which sometimes feel like \u201ca roll of barbed wire scrunched inside me, scraping underneath, all day every day\u201d and other times keen into the ecstatic, especially when he\u2019s encased in his headphones, immersed in a mix. At one moment, he\u2019s blessed with the raver\u2019s revelation that \u201cGod is a bouncy bastard who wants his people together in the dance.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s both a hapless, hurting child and a dangerous, violent young man, and his author has loved each part of him into being with the same steady attention. The awful is pretty awful: One of Shy\u2019s offenses is having attacked another boy with a broken beer bottle. Reinhabiting the moment, Shy recalls the way the weapon \u201copens a line straight across the top of the kid\u2019s forehead, unzips the skin\u201d and how he \u201cwatches a sheet of blood fall down like special effects, cheap and nasty, and he thinks Wow, so easy.\u201d",
      "This is, however, an ultimately optimistic book, even if saying so risks casting a slick of the sentimental over a work so admirably grounded. I won\u2019t unsee that sheet of blood, but nor will I unsee a comic, charismatic, deplorable, lovable, still living and not-entirely-hopeless boy doing a little dance by himself, headphones on, at 3 a.m., to an audience of two dead badgers.",

      "\u201cMen put me down as the best woman painter,\u201d Georgia O\u2019Keeffe once said. \u201cI think I\u2019m one of the best painters.\u201d That famous quote by the American modernist serves as an epigraph in Part 2 of the Guardian",
      "columnist Katy Hessel\u2019s sweeping first book, \u201cThe Story of Art Without Men.\u201d \u201cWomen artists are not a trend,\u201d Hessel maintains; and yet the contested category persists, not as a meaningful distinction but rather as a repercussion of patriarchy, a category that the male-dominated art world consistently, in O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s terms, diminishes.",
      "Part revisionist history, part coffee-table book, part collective portrait, part archival treasure hunt, Hessel\u2019s treatise covers the 1500s to the present in an attempt to make good on its title. But despite her best efforts, men can\u2019t help appearing throughout, as rich husbands, abusive boyfriends, artist fathers, needy sons, muse-hungry painters, institutions and even that supreme male gaze, God\u2019s.",
      "In this 500-page tome, Hessel, who cites her Instagram account @thegreatwomenartists as part of the book\u2019s origin, efficiently introduces us to a mosaic of artists, from the well-known Artemisia Gentileschi, Frida Kahlo, Hilma af Klint, Tracey Emin and Kara Walker to the lesser-known Elisabetta Sirani, Marie Denise Villers and Lady Butler, and even gestures toward the multitude of names that we might never know.",
      "The book\u2019s chronological and compendium-like structure allows for an abundance of \u201cfirsts\u201d: Lavinia Fontana is \u201cthought to be one of the first women in Western art to paint female nudes,\u201d in 1595; Alma Thomas is \u201cthe first African American woman to achieve a solo exhibition at the Whitney,\u201d in 1972; \u201cA Lesbian Show\u201d was \u201cthe first all-lesbian art show in the U.S.,\u201d in New York City in 1978; the 20th-century Mexican artist Aurora Reyes Flores is considered \u201cthe first female Muralist\u201d; and so on. The result is an engaging but necessarily clipped perspective. Through her narrative form and focus on representation, Hessel\u2019s lineage of milestones obscures both the political history behind women\u2019s exclusion from the canon and the possibility of struggle against it.",
      "Hessel\u2019s target audience is \u201canyone of any art-historical level interested in learning the stories of these mostly overshadowed artists.\u201d It is unsurprising, then, that her survey \u2014 which includes roughly 300 images, a glossary of art-historical terminology and a six-page timeline of artists from the Dutch Golden Age to the Harlem Renaissance to today \u2014 favors the global over the local. ",
      "From the beginning Hessel warns that \u201cthis is not a definitive history \u2014 it would be an impossible task,\u201d and acknowledges the challenges of her broad-stroked approach: the complications of fitting individuals into sanctioned aesthetic movements; the sensitivities around the vexed category of \u201cwoman artists,\u201d which for Hessel is no longer a \u201cderogatory\u201d term but \u201can embodiment of power\u201d; and the ever-evolving status of these distinctions in our present and future.",
      "But although her index of names succeeds in providing some answer to the question posed in Linda Nochlin\u2019s trailblazing 1971 essay \u201cWhy Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,\u201d Hessel does less than Nochlin did, 50 years ago, to unsettle the terms of the question itself. Can inserting women into the art-historical canon interrupt the system of canonization itself? Why does Hessel rely on the same methods of archival organization \u2014 linear history, market-based tastes, distinct genre boundaries \u2014 that played a part in producing women\u2019s very exclusion? How instead might the fact of women\u2019s presence disrupt the presuppositions of art\u2019s place in the world?",
      "An especially moving chapter, \u201cThe Body in Sculpture,\u201d initiates an answer. Here Hessel examines the midcentury sculpture of Eva Hesse, itself \u201cdifficult to describe,\u201d and the performance art of Yoko Ono (\u201ca genre defined by risk-taking\u201d), and their engagements with the body\u2019s virtues and grotesqueness, providing context for second-wave feminism\u2019s focus on sexual violence and reproductive politics.",
      "\u201cHow, through the power of art,\u201d Hessel asks, \u201ccan you make people feel the visceral sensation of a body that has been hurt or scrutinized, idealized, or wrought with scars of barely comprehensible histories?\u201d",
      "Hessel also underscores how many of the artists in \u201cThe Story of Art Without Men\u201d have been denied access to education, funding, gallery representation, media attention, attribution and even participation in public life. They have died poor, depressed, institutionalized or simply unknown. No book could repair those wrongs \u2014 but especially not one that remains concerned with indexing and inclusivity, rather than with a broader and more fervent social critique.",

      "On Feb. 13, 2014, a bored-at-work BuzzFeed quiz ricocheted around the web: \u201c",
      "\u201d",
      "The \u201cactually\u201d seemed to promise a solid, data-driven answer.",
      "You remember how these quizzes work. Select a party anthem (\u201cYMCA\u201d), a quality in a dream partner (\u201cravenous\u201d) and presto: your spiritual home. These quizzes were plenty diverting, and in the early days people shared them like joints or sparklers.",
      "But this particular quiz had a bug. Too many people got Wyoming \u2014 more than actually lived in Wyoming \u2014 and this turn of events was so exciting that people stomped over to Facebook to protest. Then, according to Ben Smith in his engrossing and suspenseful book, \u201cTraffic: Genius, Rivalry, and Delusion in the Billion-Dollar Race to Go Viral,\u201d the team at BuzzFeed noticed something that changed media forev \u2014",
      "Well, not ",
      ". This is Ben Smith, after all. Man-about-media, ironist by nature and trade. Co-founder of Semafor, former New York Times media columnist, onetime editor in chief of BuzzFeed News. In unfolding the tale of Gawker, HuffPost and BuzzFeed \u2014 the new-media ventures that, he argues, conspired to invent virality \u2014 Smith largely resists the temptation to claim that anything in his experience changed the world forever. That\u2019s for Silicon Valley hagiographies. \u201cTraffic\u201d is instead a picaresque, set among the muckrakers, Jezebels, dweebs, addicts and wing nuts of Silicon Alley, the notional New York City tech zone that runs, in theory, from Flatiron to Dumbo.",
      "But even as Smith refuses to canonize his protagonists, Nick Denton (the founder of Gawker Media) and Jonah Peretti (the co-founder of HuffPost and BuzzFeed), they occasionally alight on the odd eureka moment that a more earnest writer could have styled as world-changing. Sometimes Smith even becomes that earnest writer: \u201cWe were inventing digital media,\u201d he writes of BuzzFeed.",
      "The Wyoming quiz\u2019s eureka moment belonged to Peretti. When the quiz became BuzzFeed\u2019s most successful post, Peretti, then the company\u2019s chief executive, pinged a Facebook staffer, who explained that the platform had a new algorithm for promoting posts: Facebook was now pushing content that attracted high engagement numbers, and a comment carried four times the weight of a \u201clike.\u201d Lazy, bemused clicks were yesterday\u2019s metrics; the platform wanted garrulous comment sections. A cortisol-spiking post that made hordes of reply guys shriek \u201cWyoming!\u201d? Facebook blasted it to everyone. Two years later, the same thing would happen with posts that made users shriek \u201cTrump!\u201d",
      "Smith depicts Denton and Peretti as rivals, but they\u2019re not playing precisely the same game. With Gawker, which began in 2002, Denton was seeking to bust up traditional media with blogs that tweaked the high hats in a \u201cfaster, truer version of reality.\u201d He mastered \u201cthe refresh,\u201d according to Smith; people kept a Gawker tab open all day and compulsively checked for updates.",
      "At HuffPost, which started as The Huffington Post in 2005, and then BuzzFeed, which joined the scene in 2006, Peretti was directing and redirecting the surges of online influence \u2014 traffic \u2014 that he had taught himself how to manipulate as a graduate student at M.I.T. He was also conducting moral experiments, trying to determine whether all this traffic should, or could, be pressed into the service of \u201cactivism, politics, business or simply fun.\u201d",
      "Denton came to New York from San Francisco in 2002 with an air of what Smith calls \u201ccasual cruelty\u201d and a conviction that \u201cblogging was the future.\u201d Joining forces with the journalist Elizabeth Spiers, Denton swept up astute writers like Jessica Coen and Emily Gould and tasked them with zinging the rich and famous on his new platform, Gawker. For years, the site smote its enemies with an energy both sporting and bloodthirsty only to find itself defeated in the 2010s by two formidable forces: the right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel, and love.",
      "Thiel, who, according to Smith\u2019s account, despised Denton for once calling him \u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cparanoid,\u201d ",
      " a lawsuit over Gawker\u2019s ",
      " that pushed the website into bankruptcy. But in Smith\u2019s amused telling, what really drained the battery of the Gawker project was that Denton fell in love with Derrence Washington, now his husband. The romance, Smith suggests, dampened his personal spikiness and his taste for unalloyed snark.",
      "Peretti, for his part, joined Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart and Kenneth Lerer to start The Huffington Post, which was first conceived as a progressive alternative to The Drudge Report. Fresh out of the M.I.T. Media Lab, Peretti deployed his wizardry in conjuring traffic to drive a hodgepodge website to box-office glory. It was ",
      ". for $315 million in 2011.",
      "Peretti then jumped to full time at the other company he\u2019d helped start, BuzzFeed,just as Smith took over as editor in chief of BuzzFeed News. By the time the Wyoming quiz hit peak virality, Peretti was in close contact with Facebook while Smith, who had come to BuzzFeed from Politico, was brooding about how to attract traffic to political reporting.",
      "The showdown between BuzzFeed and Gawker is best understood as a contest of attitudes. BuzzFeed in its early years was all Disney princesses, cute pets and ",
      ", while Gawker had put its chips on tabloid-style expos\u00e9s and spite. Politico recorded a ",
      " war of ",
      " And unlike New York literary battles past \u2014 Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal, anyone? \u2014 this one could be decisively won. By the numbers. Gawker would sneer, BuzzFeed would coo and the winner would be the post to attract the most clicks, views, likes, shares, comments and, of course, complaints.",
      "Anna Holmes, the founder of Jezebel, Gawker Media\u2019s women-focused site, appears frequently in \u201cTraffic,\u201d but she deserves a biography of her own. Not only did she create a juggernaut, starting in 2007 \u2014 ",
      " \u2014 but she savaged, without apology, both ",
      " and workaday sexism, including disturbingly photoshopped images of women\u2019s bodies. With Jezebel, and in spite of Denton\u2019s initial incomprehension, Holmes and her staff invented an unsparing house style that has become the idiom of modern American feminism.",
      "Smith finally got his own taste of viral fame in 2017, when he opted, controversially, to publish the so-called Steele dossier, documenting supposed collusion with Russian agents by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and filled with salacious details about Trump\u2019s escapades in Russia. Smith ",
      ". But when its ",
      ", he wrung his hands. Can viral political content ever be valuable political content \u2014 and vice versa?",
      "Anxiety about this question haunts Smith, and this moral seriousness is what lifts \u201cTraffic\u201d above other accounts of adventures in start-up land. The most cinematic treachery in \u201cTraffic\u201d turns out to have been pulled off not by Peretti\u2019s traffic apparatus or by Denton\u2019s cruelty factory but by the figures who play Igors to their Frankensteins. These include Peretti\u2019s Huffington Post co-founder Breitbart, who went on to create the far-right website Breitbart.com; Benny Johnson, whom Smith hired at BuzzFeed and then fired (for extensive plagiarism) and who now works for the conservative youth group Turning Point USA; and an alt-right stuntman known as Baked Alaska, who quit a job at BuzzFeed to work as a \u201ctour manager\u201d for the right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos and was ",
      " in the Jan. 6 insurrection. (On April 20, Peretti announced that BuzzFeed would be ",
      ", part of a broader downsizing at the company.)",
      "What, in the end, did these pioneers of Silicon Alley invent? A way to \u201cmeasure culture,\u201d Smith writes. He then defines \u201cculture\u201d as \u201cthe volume of outrage or the success of a joke.\u201d Indignation and laughter.",
      "This modern conception of culture jostles in my mind alongside Matthew Arnold\u2019s still seductive notion that culture is beauty and intelligence \u2014 \u201csweetness and light.\u201d The jostling feels by turns productive and abrasive.",

      "The only snag? The art is ",
      ", and no one seems to realize it. Early in Justin Cronin\u2019s new novel, Proctor Bennett, the titular ferryman, attends a piano recital and finds the experience akin to \u201cwatching someone perfectly hammer nails into a board.\u201d This aesthetic judgment arrives with all the force of a consciousness-changing epiphany.",
      "The narration\u2019s pleasingly sharp details \u2014 the \u201casparagus grilled in a film of oil,\u201d a blazer that bears a yacht club\u2019s insignia \u2014 are some of the many appealing things about \u201cThe Ferryman,\u201d a 538-page book that clips along as effortlessly as you might scroll through a well-curated Instagram feed. There\u2019s something mildly intoxicating, in fact, about entering this utopia, called Prospera, because Cronin\u2019s shrewd world-building allows us to have it both ways: We sink into aspirational fantasy even as we relish the author\u2019s sly commentary on a certain species of coastal elite. (Prospera is an island, after all.)",
      "Even the book\u2019s genre touches are incorporated with a certain lightness. Rather than undergo the indignities of birth and death, old or infirm Prosperans are sent by ferry to a mysterious island called the Nursery, where their memories are wiped and their bodies rejuvenated, so they can return as hale 16-year-olds with new identities.",
      "Unlike most Prosperans, Proctor \u2014 42 years old, comfortably married, proud civil servant \u2014 dreams in his sleep. But after a disastrous incident that occurs when Proctor escorts his own aging father to the ferry, his dreams become indistinguishable from reality, and his respectable life begins to disintegrate. \u201cYou\u2019re not \u2026 ",

      "His new sense of estrangement draws him to Thea, the only person who acknowledges how awful the art on Prospera is.

It\u2019s a careful book with a limited cast, animated by the bonds of parental and romantic love. An undercurrent of grief, organized around a pure, almost unobjectionable family tragedy, forms the book\u2019s emotional core, and the scenes of fatherly doting that recur throughout are so pitch-perfect that they verge at times on treacle. At the same time, the plot features car chases, shootouts, the infiltration of a government building and a twist that completely alters the frame of the story precisely two-thirds of the way through.",
      "Occasionally, the seams show. Cronin\u2019s prose is mostly lucid and considered, but certain patches of overwriting read like attempts to inject unnecessary grandeur into the proceedings. One woman leads her husband to bed as a final farewell: \u201cHer body would say to him the things that words could not.\u201d Proctor, in nearly all respects a generic everyman, has an unfortunate habit of bursting into rhapsodic apostrophe. \u201cWater, life-giving treasure of the universe!\u201d he thinks at one point. \u201cWhat fantastical creatures must teem within your depths, what wonders lurk beneath your storm-tossed waves!\u201d",
      "Storm-tossed waves crop up again and again in this novel, which is drenched with references to \u201cThe Tempest\u201d: freak squalls, an enchanted island, the name Prospera. Prospero\u2019s monologues are even quoted directly in the book\u2019s latter half. The twist, after an initial ",
      " of insight, is disappointingly reminiscent of more than one blockbuster sci-fi movie released in the past two decades, and Cronin\u2019s methodical explanations still aren\u2019t enough to quell lingering questions about how exactly it all works.",
      "But his nods to Shakespeare hint at bigger themes. The idea of a benevolent puppet master echoes through \u201cThe Ferryman,\u201d from the godlike Designer who created Prospera to the Great Soul worshiped by the Arrivalists. Shakespeare\u2019s Prospero, we understand, is a similar figure, creating illusions that hold the other characters in sway, the god of his own little island. By the end of \u201cThe Ferryman,\u201d Proctor and Prospero and Cronin and Shakespeare are all linked, and the novel becomes meta-commentary on the creative act itself. When one character muses, at a climactic moment, that perhaps \u201call creation was boxes within boxes within boxes, each the dream of a different god,\u201d one imagines Cronin giving the reader a broad wink.",
      "Some may find this idea profound; I found it deflating. Those early suggestions about the relationship between \u201creal life\u201d and the creation of good art seem, in this light, to be a useful plot device rather than a proposal about how our own world might work. If in the end everything is just \u201cboxes within boxes,\u201d how much meaning does the notion of \u201creal life\u201d even hold?",
      "But maybe this is asking too much of a story meant to engross and entertain, which its satisfying epilogue, in particular, does in spades. The novel delivers everything you\u2019d want from your nightly dreams: an anodyne, occasionally beautiful diversion, rife with patterns and the suggestion of deeper truth that vanishes as soon as you lift your eyes from the last page.",

      "Living with bipolar disorder \u2014 formerly called manic depression \u2014 is hard enough, but memoirists afflicted with it face an additional quandary: how to turn their bizarre and frightening experiences into books that grip rather than repel the reader. When they are successful, such reports grant us rare access to the psychic antipodes \u2014 a chaotic realm of hyper-signification and cosmic paranoia far beyond the boundaries of healthy consciousness. Joining the likes of Kay Redfield Jamison\u2019s \u201cAn Unquiet Mind,\u201d Leonora Carrington\u2019s \u201cDown Below\u201d and, more recently, Arnold Thomas Fanning\u2019s harrowing \u201cMind on Fire,\u201d is the German novelist and translator Thomas Melle\u2019s illuminating memoir of the illness that has devastated his life.",
      "\u201cThe World at My Back\u201d",
      "recounts three prolonged manic episodes and their painful aftermaths, the first in 1999, when Melle was in his 20s and newly living in Berlin. The others were in 2006 and 2010 (an epilogue brings us up to 2016, the year the book was first published in Germany). \u201cWhen I had sex with Madonna, I felt good for a moment,\u201d he writes in the opening pages \u2014 a foretaste of the weird delusions and extreme derangement that follow, in which celebrities like Bj\u00f6rk, Trent Reznor and G\u00fcnter Grass are coordinates in the internal cosmology of a psyche utterly spinning out.",
      "The onset of Melle\u2019s bipolar disorder coincides with his emergence as an acclaimed novelist, and at first his megalomania is camouflaged by the typically grandiose ambition of the young writer. Soon however, accelerated by early blogging culture and online forums, his madness is unmistakable \u2014 and alienates his friends and peers. As Philip K. Dick observed in his novel of psychosis \u201cValis,\u201d the mentally disturbed eschew simple interpretations and \u201cshoot for the baroque.\u201d In Melle\u2019s messianic delusions even \u201cHitler had in the end believed that he was me.\u201d Literally everything is about him \u2014 \u201cright down to the Gaza Strip\u201d \u2014 and everyone is either on his side or out to get him.",
      "Such books as \u201cThe World at My Back\u201d",
      "recount experiences of total frenzy from a vantage point of clarity and calm. What makes Melle\u2019s stand out is that he seems aware of how blackly funny the intimate details of psychotic breakdown can be. His narrative skill, in Luise Von Flotow\u2019s translation, had me laughing out loud without my losing sight of the sorrow and loneliness behind the succession of outrageous incidents, including excruciating public appearances at literary prize ceremonies.",
      "Not so amusing are the passages where Melle attempts suicide by overdose and fakes his own death, or his frequent hospitalizations. He\u2019s astute on the agonies of shame endured when the mania ends and the depression sets in (\u201cDepression is not a lack of feeling, which is what I had imagined, it is a constant humiliation\u201d). And he\u2019s sadly on the mark when he admits that bipolar disorder is \u201cnot an illness that elicits empathy.\u201d The tragedy of the afflicted is that they drift helplessly into the realm of the sinister; friends and colleagues want to help, only to eventually back off, fearing that they will become targets of paranoid vitriol or abuse.",
      "There are minor irritations: Melle\u2019s habit of assuming familiarity with his previous works; a hurried diaristic flatness that intermittently washes out his style (\u201cDid my rounds, still filled with shame. Read a lot again\u201d); an occasional, jarring flippancy. By his third onset of mania the recounted delusions begin to feel mechanical.",
      "On the whole, though, Melle succeeds exceptionally well in conveying catastrophic loss while commanding the reader\u2019s attention. Not only is there no aspect of his life that hasn\u2019t been adversely affected by his condition \u2014 from his libido and his hairline to his literary output \u2014 by the book\u2019s end he can\u2019t even be sure that another, potentially worse attack isn\u2019t coming down the tracks. While only the ",
      " of mania is chronic, Melle\u2019s bipolar disorder is a life sentence. It\u2019s sobering to think that even his memoir\u2019s success \u2014 a best seller in Germany, it has been adapted for the stage and translated into many languages \u2014 is not something he will be able to straightforwardly enjoy. This excellent book is faint consolation for the dreadful times that brought it into being.",

But \u201cDeath of an Author\u201d is arguably the first halfway readable A.I. novel, an early glimpse at what is vectoring toward readers. It has been presided over by a literate writer who has pushed the borg in twisty directions. He got it to spit out more than boilerplate, some of the time.

      "The book has metafictional zest. It\u2019s about a well-known Canadian writer named Peggy Firmin, who vaguely resembles Margaret Atwood. She is collaborating on an all-encompassing A.I. project with a hoodie-wearing billionaire who once dated Meghan Markle. His name is Neil Gibson, in homage, one assumes, to the cyberpunk writers Neal Stephenson and William Gibson, even though he\u2019s a lout and, to the best of my knowledge, Stephenson and Gibson are not.",

The prose mostly has the crabwise gait of a Wikipedia entry. If this novel could exhale, its breath would surely smell, to borrow words from Ian McEwan in his novel \u201cMachines Like Me,\u201d like the back of a warm TV set.",
      "What\u2019s interesting are the moments when you sense Marche pushing the A.I., like Wendy Carlos bent over her Moog synthesizer, or a kid rocking a pinball machine, to go deeper. Firmin predicts, for example, where we might be in a few years with this technology:",
      "We\u2019ll also see stories created specifically for individuals inside their experience, the ability to recreate dead relatives through A.I. technology. Stories where the audience doesn\u2019t even know they\u2019re stories. Characters who are felt so deeply that they aren\u2019t characters at all, but you become the character. It\u2019s going to be a gorgeous mess.",

      "It\u2019s hard to tell when you\u2019re reading Marche and when you\u2019re reading A.I., but it\u2019s good to know there might still be humor, of a sort, in the spell-checked world of our digital-language overlords. There\u2019s a crack about the awfulness of the metaverse, and a letter has the sexy sign-off \u201cDesiring your algorithm.\u201d",

      " by Abraham Verghese",
      "Abraham Verghese occupies a curious place in the modern literary landscape. A doctor who decided midcareer to train at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, he has gone on to achieve distinction in both fields. He is a professor of the theory and practice of medicine at Stanford Medical School, continues in clinical practice, has won the National Humanities Medal, speaks widely about the importance of the human element of what has become a technocratic practice, and has won awards for both fiction and nonfiction. His last novel, \u201cCutting for Stone,\u201d spent more than two years on this newspaper\u2019s best-seller list.",
      "It is tempting to look at him as a man with multiple careers running in tandem, but all his work is anchored in a consistent, profound moral architecture of the spirit. He suffered considerably when he was younger \u2014 experiences he has chronicled in his earlier fiction and nonfiction \u2014 and emerged a romantic, determined to be kind and extravagantly compassionate, a genuine humanist. In an era when seriousness is often presumed to entail skepticism, he is serious about benevolence. By projecting his own best self, he hopes to coax out the best selves of others.",
      "It is hard to operate consistently on such high principles, harder still to explain them to others, and hardest of all to demand that others rise to them. The modesty of ostentatiously kindhearted people can come off as smug, and in his public statements, Verghese occasionally assumes a bothersome tone of condescension. His new novel, \u201cThe Covenant of Water,\u201d focuses almost entirely on good people (to whom many terrible things happen), and given the complexity of human beings, the surfeit of grace sometimes feels unrealistic and even pretentious, as though the writer is affiliating himself with standards that ordinary humans cannot attain. The lack of ill intent or even ambivalence among the book\u2019s many heroes can become cloying. This is not a novel endowed with subtle psychological insights, and it is devoid of humor: on the part of the characters or about them.",
      "It is, however, grand, spectacular, sweeping and utterly absorbing. ",
      " has a gift for suspense, and his easy relationship to language draws you through the narrative so effortlessly that you hardly realize you are plowing through decade upon decade and page upon page. The book begins in 1900, as a 12-year-old girl in what is now the state of Kerala, in southwest India, prepares for an unwanted arranged marriage. It ends in 1977, when that girl\u2019s physician granddaughter arrives at a shocking discovery. The family are Indian Christians, descendants of those first converted by St. Thomas in the first century A.D. They lead tough but often joyful lives, and they gradually make their way up in the world despite impossible-looking challenges. A plot synopsis would take a hundred pages and spoil the fun, but let it be known that this family loves and suffers in a cavalcade of ways.",
      "The tone of the book is sometimes pedagogical: There are a lot of doctors here, and we learn in rather fine detail about surgical procedures, anatomical constructions and medical interventions. Verghese\u2019s writing about all things medical is particularly adroit; his profound understanding of the human body is perhaps his greatest strength. Even if the personalities of the numerous physicians are not fully rounded, their identities as doctors are. We also learn a great deal about India, some of which we might already have known: the caste system; the social upheavals of the 20th century; a variety of foods; information about architecture, farming and family structure; the place of faith in the society; the eventual move toward socialism.",
      "Like Amy Tan\u2019s \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d which catered to a voyeuristic interest in Asia by selecting its most accessibly endearing characteristics, this novel recalls the curry one might get in a small American farm town: exotic by local standards, not wrong in any way, but substantially softened for the locals. Some of the exposition can seem almost patronizing to a more worldly reader. The view of India does not achieve the plangent intimacy that, for example, Vikram Seth achieves in \u201cA Suitable Boy.\u201d This is populist writing, ambitious in plot but not in character, and populated with archetypes rather than people. So, in many ways, was the work of Charles Dickens, whose crackling but now rather historical method of storytelling may be among Verghese\u2019s inspirations.",
      "Yet why should we assume that sophistication requires cynicism? Sometimes it is satisfying when good things happen to good people, when the nastiness that has tended to reap rewards in the harsh world of modern fiction takes a break. People may not be as good as Verghese\u2019s characters, but neither are they as bad as Philip Roth\u2019s or Saul Bellow\u2019s. Ugliness is not truer than loveliness, nor cruelty more so than kindness. Sometimes, the world\u2019s insults are simple ones: a child who dies, a fire, a disease, a flood. There is pungent truth outside of malice.",
      "This book may follow \u201cCutting for Stone\u201d onto the best-seller list and stay there for a long time. It does not present the dark and fantastical complexity of India limned by Salman Rushdie in \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children,\u201d and its occasional gestures toward the mystical feel contrived. Still, it will expose people without much connection to South Asian culture to beauties to which they might otherwise not have access. In a period of divisiveness, racism and anti-Asian hate, that is as important an accomplishment as changing our understanding of what fiction can do, or explaining how the world\u2019s largest democracy came to elect Narendra Modi, or delving into the anti-Islamic face of Hindu nationalism. The arranged marriage that begins the book is a happy one; many are not, and the status of women in rural India remains often problematic; that should not, however, undermine the reality that such marriages succeed at least as often as those predicated on romance.",
      "The trick is to read the book not as realism, but as a fable. The impetus to write it began with a notebook that Verghese\u2019s mother wrote for an inquisitive granddaughter, and the earlier parts of \u201cThe Covenant of Water\u201d have the soothing haze of sentimental recollection. Even as the book moves toward more recent times, when Verghese himself was alive, and begins to express some awareness of a troubled world, its plot is so thick with extremes and unlikely coincidences, so highly wrought, so dense with drama, that it doesn\u2019t feel real. But it doesn\u2019t need to. Verghese has given us entry to Cochin and Travancore as they once existed or never did, and to a family whose saga is full of grief and yet oddly reassuring.",
      "The great novels about India by Indian expatriates are often traumatic to read. This one is not a literary accomplishment at the level of Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s \u201cThe Namesake\u201d or Arundhati Roy\u2019s \u201cThe God of Small Things\u201d; nonetheless, I would happily spend months on end with it and I cried when it was done. While I don\u2019t entirely believe in Verghese\u2019s characters, I am moved by how much he loves them and, in so doing, makes the reader love them. At this moment, I am longing to go to Kerala; I am as nostalgic for Big Ammachi as I am for my own grandmother. It is a better world for having a book in it that chronicles so many tragedies in a tone that never deviates from hope.",

      "At their groundbreaking restaurant ",
      ", Junghyun and Jeongeun Park seem to have the keys to a secret room filled with flavors that New York\u2019s older Korean restaurants barely hint at. Nearly every course on the elaborate tasting menus is made up of a dozen or more ingredients. There are stunning imported vinegars derived from mugwort, birch and cherry blossoms. Kimchi, often made on site, does not stop with cabbage and radishes but plunges into a realm of fermented tomatoes, chiles and mustard leaves.",
      "Some interesting items turn up on the plates at ",
      ", too, which the Parks \u2014 he goes by J.P. and she is called Ellia \u2014 have been operating in the Rockefeller Center concourse since October. You can, for instance, eat a sorbet flavored by the fleshy seed stalks of the Japanese raisin tree.",
      "But novelty is not the main point of this younger restaurant. While Atomix tries to expand our notions of what modern Korean cuisine might contain, Naro\u2019s executive chef, Nate Kuester, takes a different tack. His kitchen dives straight into traditional foods, starting with favorites like bibimbap and seafood jeon and reaching back to recipes that predate the 20th century, in ways that make them seem full of unexplored potential.",
      "Naengchae, a chilled salad usually presented with thin strips of vegetables fanned out on a plate, is a mainstay of Korean tables inside and outside the home. At Naro, the naengchae looks like a nest of vermicelli noodles when it shows up. The vermicelli turn out to be threads of kohlrabi, and they sit on top of lumps of king crab, slices of simmered octopus, wheels of watermelon radish and dabs of hot mustard, all meant to be stirred together. There\u2019s something else, too: flaky crystals of radish granita. This is an allusion to mul naengmyeon, cold noodles served in ice-cold, sometimes slushy brine that is used to pickle radishes. It\u2019s a magician\u2019s trick, this salad that turns into noodles that turn back into a salad again.",
      "Another illusion: the one-bite appetizer that looks at first like a piece of kimbap, soft tendrils of bracken fern wrapped in a belt of seaweed. When you eat it, though, you discover that the seaweed has somehow become as puffy and crunchy as a cracker \u2014 a version of gim bugak, the fried seaweed snack.",
      "Sanjeok, normally a straightforward skewer of grilled meats and vegetables, is also reimagined at Naro. Sweet soft bricks of butternut squash alternate with lengths of emulsified chicken sausage. It is surely the best chicken hot dog on a stick ever served in a Korean restaurant.",
      "Simpler dishes hold discoveries at Naro, too, like mixed mushrooms stir-fried with pickled burdock and mounded over a bowl of short-grain rice. The mushrooms are seasoned with sesame oil and seeds, and the rice is merely steamed, but very few things I\u2019ve eaten lately have tasted as rare and luxurious. And this is only a side dish. It showed up, with no warning from the menu, alongside a snowy block of halibut in a golden, aromatic broth made from the rice wine cheongju.",
      "You eat all this and more in a spare, incongruously futuristic dining room separated from the concourse by a curving Art Deco glass wall. Black chairs punctuate an expanse of white and off-white panels and banquettes, making the space look something like a set from \u201c",
      ".\u201d (It may be relevant that Naro-1 was the name of ",
      " to place a satellite in orbit around the earth.)",
      "A darker shade of paint on the ceiling and the sheer curtains that appeared on the glass wall in April have made the space look slightly less sci-fi. It is not the only change at Naro as the Parks try to adapt their vision of formal Korean dining to an underground mall full of office workers, tourists, commuters and skaters. The price of the tasting menus at dinner (one vegetarian and one not, each with about 11 courses) dropped to $165 from $195. Lunch, which had been a five-course, $95 tasting, now comes in a variety of sizes: two courses for $52, two courses and dessert for $68, and an \u00e0 la carte menu that runs from $19 to $46.",
      "The Parks have always been skilled at fitting their hospitality style to their interiors. At their first restaurant, ",
      ", which looks like an after-work canteen that might have been designed by ",
      " the hospitality strikes a gracious, casual tone. The precise but engaging spirit at Atomix sets the standard for tasting-counter service in the city.",
      "Naro aims for a blend of formality and friendliness, and servers are quick with a smile. They\u2019re quick all around, and not always in the right way. Early on, explanations of some dishes were so rushed I am still not quite sure what I ate, and the check was dropped at the same time as dessert; before I\u2019d picked up a spoon, somebody circled back for my credit card.",
      "The pace has slowed, but I still get the sense that Naro, like some of ",
      " in the concourse, is still trying to catch the rhythms of Rockefeller Center, where some people come just to look around and others are on their way to some other place.",
      "None of this seems to afflict Naro\u2019s kitchen, which has always been uncannily assured. The pastry chef, Celia Lee, who was last seen at ",
      ", puts together sweet meditations that could probably stand alone if the Parks decided to turn Naro into a dessert bar. Her sorbet of hallabong tangerines, a prized product of the island of Jeju, paired with fresh tangerine sections and a fluffy gin-scented cloud of Negroni over jellied Champagne, might even work at one of the city\u2019s more forward-thinking cocktail bars."

      "Sometimes, the process takes days. The Appalachian bread rolls that the pastry chef Michael Werrell prepares at Audrey begin in the early evening, to be continued the following morning when 100 to 200 of them are bulk-fermented, degassed, shaped, proofed and baked.

      "Some salads are tossed, while others, like this one, are composed. The idea for this delicate, appealing first course is to have an assortment of complementary greens, herbs and vegetables, artfully arranged on a platter or individual plates, dribbled with a tangy vinaigrette. Feel free to improvise: A few spinach leaves, a handful of raw sweet garden peas or fava beans, or thinly sliced raw artichoke can be nice additions, as can edible blossoms like nasturtium, rose or calendula.",

      "To get thick slices, you\u2019ll need a couple of medium to large heads. Be warned that there will be trimmings, to be turned into a soup or use for stir-fry for another meal. But I never mind having too much cauliflower. If you don\u2019t want bother with slices, you can make this dish with baked florets just as easily.",
      "It\u2019s a simple dish to prepare. The steaks are painted with extra-virgin olive oil, seasoned on both sides, and then roasted, topped with cheese and bread crumbs, and placed back into the oven to get golden. If you top them with a bit of anchovy, it\u2019s not vegetarian, of course, but it\u2019s awfully good. These steaks are surprisingly substantial and filling. An option to consider is serving the baked cauliflower steaks with a light marinara sauce, but they are very tasty with no sauce at all.",
      "Here, in California, recent torrential rains have pummeled the strawberry fields and prevented the daily harvest. Thankfully, now the sun shines, and organic local strawberries are back.",
      "For dessert, I made them the centerpiece: I sliced some and lightly sugared and spooned them into glasses, topping them with ricotta cream \u2014 sweetened ultra-fresh ricotta, lightly whipped. Commonly used in Sicily to fill cannoli or frost traditional cakes, it is pretty fabulous. I layered the lovely stuff with the strawberries for a splendid parfait.",

      "No matter how you feel about King Charles III and Queen Camilla\u2019s recently revealed ",
      ", it seems unlikely to eclipse the most famous coronation dish of all \u2014 ",
      ".",
      "Created for the ",
      " of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, the posh, delicately flavored chicken has, like Britain itself, changed a bit since. What was originally an aristocratic paragon of classic French technique has been democratized into a weeknight-easy chicken salad. Though enormously popular in Britain as a sandwich filling and baked-potato topper, this ocher-tinted, raisin-studded dish would be unrecognizable to any of the 350 dignitaries who partook of its regal ancestor.",
      "The ",
      ", developed at the Cordon Bleu culinary school in London, was called \u201cpoulet Reine Elizabeth.\u201d A dish of cold poached chicken in a rose-hued sauce made from red wine, mayonnaise, whipped cream, apricot pur\u00e9e and a faint whiff of curry powder, it was served alongside a pea-studded rice salad at a coronation banquet to the queen\u2019s honored guests (but not likely to the queen herself).",
      ", a London-based food writer and author of \u201c",
      ",\u201d describes that dish as shaped by French cuisine with a nod toward colonial India, and based on the jubilee chicken created in 1935 for George V, who, like his grandmother Queen Victoria, had a penchant for curries.",
      "\u201cThe curry powder in coronation chicken was probably an acknowledgment of the influence of the empire and a tribute to the two previous curry-loving monarchs,\u201d Ms. Sukhadwala wrote in an email.",
      "Over the years, the recipe has become something more accessible to British home cooks. Out went the red wine reduction, whipped cream, homemade mayonnaise and apricot pur\u00e9e; in came jarred mayonnaise, golden raisins, sliced almonds and mango chutney, pantry staples you could quickly stir together in one bowl. And what was once a pinch of curry powder grew to several tablespoons, staining the mix a vivid \u2014 some say lurid \u2014 yellow.",
      "By the 1980s, coronation chicken salad had become ubiquitous in Britain, found in ready-made sandwiches at Marks & Spencer and on backyard party menus alike.",
      "This steep ascent was fueled by what the British food writer ",
      ", author of \u201c",
      ",\u201d calls a revival of Raj nostalgia that set in with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s tenure as prime minister.",
      "Coronation chicken \u201cwants to evoke the peacocks and rubies, the grandeur and spice of regal Indian dynasties, without actually delivering any strong flavors,\u201d Mr. Loyal said.",
      "Yet he\u2019s a fan. His version, which uses a complex Punjabi masala with black and green cardamom, ajwain, fennel and tamarind, alludes to the beloved 1980s version of his childhood while celebrating Mr. Loyal\u2019s identity as a second-generation British Indian.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m un-diluting its Indianness,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, the 1980s version is delightful, and a snap to make.",
      "The key is to choose your ingredients carefully. Start with cooked chicken that already has loads of flavor, whether you\u2019re poaching it yourself or buying a rotisserie bird from the store. Find a mango chutney brand that\u2019s complex and not too sweet. Use a good, tangy mayonnaise, ideally homemade. And \u2014 if you can find it \u2014 stir in curry paste from a jar instead of curry powder, which, depending on the brand, can have a raw, acrid undertone.",
      "The result is a dish for the people that\u2019s fit for a king. Which you might be hard-pressed to say about quiche."

      "Ms. Kim had wanted to study pastry in France since she was young, taking pastry and baking classes in middle school and participating in grueling pastry competitions in college in South Korea.",
      "When Ms. Kim brainstorms desserts, she always begins with fruits like apricots, melons and cherries, which she would pluck from her family\u2019s yard as a child, and builds on her ideas using the French pastry skills she has developed throughout her career.",

While their paths differ, their work is defining a growing category of pastry art that is confined neither to South Korea nor to France. It is generating long lines, earning Michelin stars and wielding influence across the pastry world.",

      " that introduced locals to hot-dog-filled rolls, airy cream buns and other uniquely French-Asian creations. Still, those bakeries were the entry point to the world of French pastry for some of the chefs taking that fusion further.",
      "Enjoying one of those baked goods was as much of a Sunday ritual for Erica Abe as going to church in Seoul as a girl. After services, her mother would take her and her brother to pick out a treat at a nearby Paris Baguette.",

Inside, you\u2019ll find that emoji-like corn mousse; the Lys\u00e9e, her signature brown rice mousse cake, which looks like a midcentury Polly Pocket piece; and a fervor for each (the shop sets a limit of one corn mousse per reservation).",

      "\u201cWe are trying to make our food based on French food, but we are Korean,\u201d said Mrs. Ki, 35. \u201cWe\u2019re used to having Korean food, and we\u2019re used to learning from Korean moms. This is in our mind. Naturally this will come into our food. That makes our food and our place very special.\u201d",
      "Other pastry chefs, like Yona Son, had to pursue French training in less conventional ways. After graduating from culinary art programs in Busan, South Korea, where she grew up, and in New York City, Ms. Son purchased about 50 American and French cookbooks on cookies, cakes, bread and professional pastry, and watched famed pastry chefs like C\u00e9dric Grolet and Amaury Guichon at work on YouTube.",

      "At her bakery in Seoul, ",
      ", she flavors financiers with sweet potato, black sesame and bean rice cake, and hallabong, the Korean tangerine. She swipes her delicate sand cookies with ganache made from stir-fried soybean paste and caramel.",
      "\u201cArmoni is like \u2018harmony\u2019 with a French accent,\u201d said Ms. Son, 33. \u201cI wanted to explain the Korean stuff and European or American dessert stuff and get them into harmony.\u201d",
      "For chefs born outside the United States who are entering the insular world of American fine dining, a sense of community is critical. Mrs. Abe had long admired Corey Lee, the chef of Benu.",

      "She follows the menu\u2019s Korean reference points for her desserts, filling the flower-shaped hwagwaja, a traditional Korean cake made of white bean and rice, with a walnut praline and preserved persimmon, and creating an adult version of the Korean snack cake called Choco Pie with Cognac, vanilla ice cream and a whole-wheat dacquoise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my career where I feel proud to be representing Korean cuisine in such a high level,\u201d Mrs. Abe said.",
      "In the West, where traditional Korean ingredients, techniques and desserts are not bound by the same cultural expectations, this style of pastry has been well received. But back in South Korea, it can be more of an adjustment for pastry chefs and customers.",
      " in Seoul isn\u2019t just for grab-and-go treats or a convenient meeting spot for friends, as is common in densely populated cities throughout Asia. Jae In Lee, the pastry chef, refuses to sell coffee, and slips Korean ingredients like woodsy burdock and soy sauce into otherwise traditional French goods like mille-feuille and madeleines.",
      "\u201cNegative feedback always exists,\u201d said Mr. Lee, 35. \u201c\u2018Not as tasty as expected, too sweet, unkind, don\u2019t sell coffee, et cetera.\u2019 We turn negative feedback into good feedback as we perfect our style.\u201d",
      "For Ms. Son, of Patisserie Armoni, it\u2019s been challenging to appeal to prospective customers who wander into her Seoul bakery. \u201cThey only think doenjang is with soup or sauces, but it can be with chocolate,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, she pushes forward, building on what she and like-minded pastry chefs from South Korea have set in motion.",

Their income came from Social Security checks. When he was 15, he dropped out of high school and moved in with a group of nearby musician friends. He played in local bands, but, at 23, found he liked teaching guitar better. His mother died of cancer a year after he established the School of Rock.",

      "The Googling that preceded Ms. France and Mr. Green\u2019s meet-up in the park in 2021 was no guarantee of a connection. Though both were still recovering from what Mr. Green called \u201cfounder\u2019s disease\u201d \u2014 \u201cKim and I both watched something we made become something different, something more capitalistic than cultural,\u201d he said \u2014 seeing each other involved a significant commute.

      "\u201cWhen we Googled each other and I saw all these great pictures of Kim with cool people and then I started reading her writing, I was already three-quarters of the way there,\u201d he said. The other quarter was in place before April 13, 2021, when he stuffed two trash bags full of his belongings into his car and moved into her place.",
      "They had been a couple for three days. They had seen each other in person exactly once. But \u201cI had told him at some point, you can come here whenever you want, and he took me extremely literally,\u201d Ms. France said.",
      "Ms. France and Mr. Green still live in the same apartment. Three weeks into living together, both knew they wanted to marry. Three months in, they started talking about it. Ms. France mentioned that a proposal involving a drum line would be nice. Mr. Green felt that was something he could make happen, which explains why, for several months, he kept the engagement ring they picked out together in his car\u2019s glove compartment. \u201cIf I got the drum line together, it would be ready,\u201d he explained.",
      "He never got the drum line together. Instead, on Nov. 18, 2022, during a weekend trip to Philadelphia, he told her he forgot something in the glove box and asked her to look. They celebrated her yes with lunch on the road.",
      "Ms. France and Mr. Green were married in her mother\u2019s Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan on April 15. The run-up featured neither fashion runways nor rock concerts. \u201cWe both wanted something really chill,\u201d Ms. France said. \u201cNo big production.\u201d",

Shirim Nothenberg, Ms. France\u2019s sister-in-law, was ordained by the Universal Life Church to marry them. Fifty guests, including Mr. Green\u2019s children, several of his students and Ms. Romolini, Ms. France\u2019s \u201cEverything is Fine\u201d co-host, attended. Ms. Nothenberg kept her remarks brief. Like everyone else in the room, she wanted to hear from the couple. \u201cThey\u2019re both clever, funny, insightful people,\u201d she said.",
      "In handwritten vows they co-wrote and took turns reading to each other, Ms. France and Mr. Green said they promised to take \u201cexquisite care\u201d of each other, and \u201cto think you are the best, so long as we both may live.\u201d",
      "Those who wanted to hear the song they cued up to play the moment they were pronounced husband and wife, ",
      " were mostly out of luck. \u201cWe played it, but people were cheering so loud for us it got drowned out,\u201d Mr. Green said.",
      "Ms. France distilled the key to their quick-to-ignite but enduring love this way: \u201cThe reason it works is we both think we\u2019re the one who got lucky.\u201d",
      " April 15, 2023",

      " Ms. France said she surprised herself during the ceremony. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to focus, because whenever you host a party, you feel frenetic,\u201d she said. But that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cIt\u2019s a corny thing to say, but I really did feel like we were the only two people in the room.\u201d Mr. Green was likewise undistracted. \u201cWhen she said, \u2018You may kiss the bride,\u2019 the rest of the world melted away,\u201d he said.",
      " At a reception in the apartment that was meant to feel more like a cocktail party, guests nibbled hors d\u2019oeuvres and passed small plates. The signature cocktail, a spicy margarita, was a particular hit. Creative Edge Parties handled catering, including a non-cake chocolate dessert that looked like a terrarium in a cup."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be offering a new service,\u201d said Michael McSweeney, the city clerk who oversees the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s going to really enhance the experience for people who want to have that special loved one officiate at their ceremony without having to take the step of becoming an ordained minister of a church.\u201d",
      "Marriages performed by officiants ordained online are not legally recognized in some of the state\u2019s counties, including Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester. The new law helps couples getting married in New York avoid misunderstandings regarding the validity of nontraditional ministers.",
      "While going through a divorce, some couples found out that they had never been legally married all along. ",
      " discovered in a case by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court that their marriage and prenuptial agreement were void because the officiant had been a Universal Life Church minister.",
      "In 2006, Sandra Galef, then a Democratic assemblywoman from Ossining, N.Y., first proposed legislation on a one-day designation for a clear alternative. Such a measure passed last year, and Gov. Kathy Hochul signed it into law on Dec. 28, 2022.",
      "One-day officiants do not have to be New York State residents, but they must be at least 18 years old. ",
      "More than 40 percent of couples in the United States are married by non-clergy, Ms. Galef said in a press announcement. California, Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island all have similar laws that allow an individual to become a marriage officiant for one day.",
      "The one-day designation was an attractive option for Ray Lyn Eddington and Michael Joseph Batal because it is free from religious associations. They are getting married on April 28 on a terrace at the William Vale Hotel in Brooklyn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s either city hall, a clergyperson or an ordained minister,\u201d Ms. Eddington, a doula from Brooklyn, said. \u201cBut if there are questions about ordained ministers being legal in some towns, then what do you do? This is a great option.\u201d (Mr. Batal is from Westchester, and they had initially considered getting married there.)",
      "Mr. Batal, who manages money for a private family, found out about the new law while researching ways to get a friend to officiate a wedding. He had previously officiated his brother\u2019s wedding in Massachusetts with a one-day license 20 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt brought back fond memories,\u201d he said.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal wanted Elizabeth Barnes to officiate their wedding because she had set the two up on a blind date in December 2019. They asked her on April 8, which was her 20-year anniversary of being cancer free, if she could perform their marriage.",
      "\u201cI started crying because all the things in life that you fight so hard for,\u201d said Ms. Barnes, a founder of two restaurants in New York, London Lennie\u2019s and Saltaire Oyster Bar. She has been Mr. Batal\u2019s longtime neighbor in Rye, N.Y. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that I could be there and not miss it and do it.\u201d",
      "Briana Myers, a philanthropies manager from Brooklyn, also received a one-day license from the Manhattan Marriage Bureau for Christie Mattson and Oliver Chan\u2019s April 22 wedding at Dumbo Loft in Brooklyn. The couple asked Ms. Myers to officiate because she had done some standup comedy shows. The couple wanted to commemorate the bride\u2019s father, who died and had been known for his dad jokes at family weddings. So, Ms. Myers told a few dad jokes at the ceremony in memory of Ms. Mattson\u2019s father.",
      "Out of excitement, Ms. Myers got ordained by the Universal Life Church immediately after the couple asked her to officiate in February 2022. The next step would have been to register her ordination at the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, but thanks to the new law, she didn\u2019t have to. The one-day license was more \u201cfit for purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to marry a whole bunch of other people or, set up my own place of worship.\u201d",
      "Ms. Myers said the process was much easier. \u201cIt was one form and it took five minutes.\u201d",
      "After a couple obtains a marriage license from their town or city clerk office, the officiant must apply for the one-day license at the same office and pay a $25 fee. They do not need to apply in person and can mail in the completed documents.",
      "In New York City, officiants must apply to the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan, regardless of the borough in which the couple received their marriage license. They can either download the ",
      ", fill it out and sign it in front of a notary public, and mail it to the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Or, they could ",
      ", bring identification and fill out the paperwork in the office and receive the license on the spot. Each county may have a different setup, so the best first step is to visit the appropriate town or city clerk\u2019s website for guidelines.",
      "Within five days after the ceremony, the officiant must mail back the one-day license attached to the marriage license.",
      "The clerk at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau provides licensees with a script to read during the ceremony. Ms. Myers said she used \u201cthe legal sounding parts of the script\u201d during Ms. Mattson and Mr. Chan\u2019s wedding because of her \u201clack of qualifications\u201d in solemnizing a marriage.",
      "Ms. Eddington and Mr. Batal appreciated the personal touch that their officiant brought to their nuptials.",
      "\u201cSo much better having such a special ceremony conducted by a dear friend who didn\u2019t need to be ordained, instead of a stranger,\u201d Mr. Batal said."

      "For three weeks after they matched on Hinge in February 2020, Jhana\u00eb K-C Bonnick and Patrick Sean McDonnell tried to make plans to meet, but both were too busy with their jobs in theater. Then the ",
      " began and everything shut down.",
      "Their first date, on March 19, was a viewing of the film \u201cAlways Be My Maybe\u201d using Teleparty (formerly Netflix Party), an extension that allows subscribers in different places to watch TV shows or movies on the streaming service at the same time.",
      "Soon they were texting each other every day. At the time, Ms. Bonnick, a Broadway stage manager, lived in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, and had no work since all the theaters had shut down. She has asthma, so she was nervous about catching Covid-19. \u201cI was in my apartment with my roommate and her cats, just hanging out for a long time,\u201d she said. Mr. McDonnell was working remotely for New York Theater Workshop as a special projects associate, and living with his parents in Carle Place, N.Y., where he grew up.",
      "In search of a novel virtual activity for them to try, Mr. McDonnell came across the \u201c",
      ".\u201d (These are part of a study developed by psychologists to investigate conversations that can build intimacy between two strangers.) In mid-April, he suggested that for their first Zoom date, they ask each other the first 12.",
      "\u201cI was like, lead to \u2026 what?\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. \u201cI\u2019m panicking, texting my friends. What does this mean?\u201d",
      "Over the course of three consecutive Saturdays, they went through the entire list. Each conversation lasted around three hours.",
      "\u201cIt works,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. \u201cWe fell in love.\u201d",
      "Mr. McDonnell said he appreciated that Ms. Bonnick \u201cwas willing to answer everything with a lot of vulnerability and thoughtfulness.\u201d",
      "Recently, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell looked through the text messages they sent each other during those early months. \u201cWe were there for each other through the really weird parts of the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      "They found ways to connect outside of the digital world, too. At one point, Ms. Bonnick, who rarely cooked or baked, mailed Mr. McDonnell a tin of homemade snickerdoodle cookies with a handwritten note. \u201cShe baked the cookies, she went to the post office in the middle of the pandemic, went to the trouble to overnight ship them,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cThat was the first time I thought, Is this what being in love is like?\u201d",
      "The note Ms. Bonnick sent with the cookies began a tradition that they still keep up with. Every month, on the anniversary of their first date, on March 19, Ms. Bonnick leaves a Post-it note for Mr. McDonnell to find. And Mr. McDonnell writes her notes during the run of each show she works on. (For their wedding, Ms. Bonnick made Mr. McDonnell a box full of notes and photos, and he wrote her a letter and made a digital album of 36 photos, one from every month they had been dating.)",
      "After more than three months of dating from afar, they finally met in person on Memorial Day, at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. \u201cWe talked for a long time,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. When they were saying goodbye, both were wearing masks and didn\u2019t know how to end the meeting physically. \u201cIn normal times, it would be a \u2018Do we kiss now?\u2019\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Instead, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a weird pause, and Patrick goes, \u2018Is it OK if we hug?\u2019\u201d Disappointed, Ms. Bonnick went home and told her roommate, \u201cWell, that was nice while it lasted.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick was convinced that the hug signified coldness, but she was misreading the signs. Soon after, Mr. McDonnell texted her as usual, and their romance continued. They began seeing each other regularly in person.",
      "That summer delivered a series of painful challenges that solidified their commitment to each other.",
      "Since receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater arts from State University of New York at New Paltz in 2014, Ms. Bonnick, 30, has worked in theater. In 2016, she had her big break as the production assistant for \u201cHadestown\u201d at the show\u2019s Off Broadway debut at New York Theater Workshop. She went on to work on shows like \u201cThe Cherry Orchard,\u201d \u201cCaroline, or Change\u201d and, more recently, \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d But several months into the pandemic, she was wondering if her career in theater was over. All she could think, she said, was \u201cI\u2019ve spent five years investing in something that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d",
      "She was facing challenges on a personal level as well. In late spring 2020, Ms. Bonnick\u2019s maternal grandfather, Joseph Johnson, died, and in August, her paternal grandfather, Keith Bonnick, also died. The Black Lives Matter protests that began in late May raised difficult emotions for Ms. Bonnick. And she and her roommate found out on short notice that they had to move out of their apartment.",
      "Mr. McDonnell, 28, who received a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater from Brooklyn College in 2017, had held on to his job for the New York Theater Workshop when the pandemic began. He is currently working full time as a security guard at Madison Square Garden.",
      "That summer, he faced a major health scare. \u201cI had a massive tumor growing along the side of my jaw,\u201d he said. \u201cIt started the size of a pea and by summer it was the size of a golf ball. I started going for tests. In mid-August, I had surgery to remove it.\u201d When he went in for a follow-up, the doctors told him that the lump had been an extremely rare form of cancer called secretory carcinoma. \u201cLuckily it was a clean removal,\u201d he said.",
      "Also that summer, Mr. McDonnell\u2019s grandfather on his father\u2019s side, James McDonnell, died, an event that deeply affected his family.",
      "Throughout it all, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell leaned on each other. He came to Manhattan regularly to join the Black Lives Matter protests or to help out at New York Theater Workshop, which, along with other theaters, decided to open its lobby to give protesters a place to drink water, use the bathrooms or just rest. In the evenings, he would head to Ms. Bonnick\u2019s apartment and stay overnight.",
      "That summer \u201cwas one of the ways I knew and felt very confident that the relationship was built to last,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cWe spent time together either navigating these things directly or hanging out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we wanted an escape, we could have an escape. If we wanted to plan, we could plan. If we just wanted to be safe, we could comfort each other. There wasn\u2019t any tension between us.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick said that all of the challenges they faced that summer, along with having started a relationship talking on the phone or texting and having done the 36 questions early on, built a foundation of constant communication. Check-ins became a norm. \u201cWe don\u2019t really fight now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t disagree. If we disagree, we\u2019re just having a different kind of conversation.\u201d",
      "Last summer, they started floating the idea of marriage. For Mr. McDonnell, the month of July carries particular significance. On July 2, 2008, when he was 13, Mr. McDonnell almost drowned at Jones Beach. The situation was dire enough that a helicopter evacuated him to a nearby hospital and he was kept there overnight. \u201cAround that time every year I think about what it means to be alive and to have been so close to death,\u201d he said. \u201cLast July, I knew I wanted to be married to her and I didn\u2019t want to wait much longer.\u201d",
      "Ms. Bonnick agreed. So that August, Mr. McDonnell arranged an outing in Port Washington, N.Y., with Ms. Bonnick\u2019s parents, Karen and Hugh Bonnick; her brother Jalel Bonnick; his parents, Laura and Peter McDonnell; his aunt and uncle, Linda and Greg Pietrzak; and his cousin Jeffrey Pietrzak. His plan to propose on the dock as the sun set was almost thwarted when the arrival of Ms. Bonnick\u2019s family from Staatsburg, N.Y., where her parents live, was delayed. Luckily, they made it, with 20 minutes to spare before nightfall.",
      "\u201cHe got down on one knee at the waterfront during sunset and asked me to marry him,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. Afterward, the two families, who were meeting for the first time, went for dinner nearby at Finn MacCool\u2019s.",
      "Choosing New York Theater Workshop as the venue for the wedding was easy. Mr. McDonnell worked at the theater for four years, and Ms. Bonnick worked on four shows there, including \u201cHadestown\u201d and \u201cSlave Play.\u201d \u201cThat was where we launched our careers and met many of our friends,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said. (They never met through work, though Mr. McDonnell knew of Ms. Bonnick.)",
      "On March 19, 2023, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell were wed in the theater\u2019s rehearsal room in front of 44 guests. Their friend, Yang-Yang Chen, who was ordained by Open Ministry, officiated. They asked guests to test for Covid-19 if they felt unwell.",
      "When choosing the date for the wedding, Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick quickly settled on March 19, their anniversary and a Sunday this year. But what they didn\u2019t count on was Ms. Bonnick\u2019s work schedule.",
      "After the 10:30 a.m. ceremony and a brunch featuring mimosas, crepe cakes from Lady M Cake Boutique, and a coffee truck, Ms. Bonnick rushed across Manhattan, from Fourth Street to the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on West 46th Street, for a 3 p.m. preview performance of \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d Ms. Bonnick, the show\u2019s assistant stage manager, walked in wearing a white, ankle-length JessaKae dress with puff sleeves. \u201cAll of my friends, the whole stage management team, were screaming,\u201d she said. Afterward, she said, \u201cI checked the props in my wedding dress.\u201d",
      "After the show, she met Mr. McDonnell and a small group of friends and family for dinner at Dim Sum Palace on Second Avenue. At some point, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell realized that besides being their anniversary, March 19 was also the last day of winter this year. \u201cIt was the perfect time for a new beginning,\u201d Ms. Bonnick said.",
      " March 19, 2023",
      " New York Theater Workshop, New York",
      "Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick will take each other\u2019s last names, both becoming Bonnick-McDonnell. It was an \u201cimportant statement of values for us, another marker of the commitment we are making together,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said.",
      "As part of the ceremony, the couple asked guests to read passages of a poem called \u201cA Spell for Reclaiming the Moment\u201d by Adrienne Maree Brown. Ms. Bonnick\u2019s close friend and former roommate, Madeleine Foster Bersin, read a passage from ",
      "\u2019s \u201cAll About Love: New Visions.\u201d \u201cWe wanted a balance between it feeling like a traditional ceremony and it feeling distinctly our own,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said.",
      " For their rings, the couple chose aquamarine, the birthstone for March."

Set as a crowd scene inside the Grand Palais, it featured a megaphone-hoisting Cara Delevingne leading a phalanx of models shouting for freedom, some waving placards that read \u201cHistory Is Her Story\u201d and \u201cLadies First.\u201d The stunt raised eyebrows, decried for trivializing an urgent political movement.",
      "Mr. Lagerfeld may well have shrugged. \u201cEverything I say is a joke,\u201d he once claimed.",
      "But the joke seemed to be on the designer when, in 1994, he sent Claudia Schiffer down the runway in a Chanel dress embroidered with a sacred Muslim text, igniting an international controversy. Mr. Lagerfeld, who said at the time that he had no idea what the text meant, ",
      ".",
      "He had previously drawn inspiration from hip-hop and rap, taking bling to the runway, festooning the models in ",
      " in hefty gold chains. Critics alleged cultural appropriation (though that term hadn\u2019t yet become the buzzword that it is today).",
      "There was no apology\u00a0then. \u201cRappers tell the truth,\u201d Mr. Lagerfeld ",

      "Ever intent on ruffling feathers, in the early \u201990s, Mr. Lagerfeld cast the Italian porn star Moana Pozzi in a Fendi show. At least one of his guests stalked out in a huff, but the designer appeared unfazed. \u201cI admire porn actors,\u201d he ",
      ", adding, \u201cThere would be much more crime without prostitutes and without porn movies.\u201d",
      "Other pronouncements were just as provocative, delivered with a self-assurance that brooked no contradiction. Some were in line with Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s persona, which seemed a deliberate parody of an imperious late-20th-century fashion designer. \u201cI am like a caricature of myself, and I like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like a mask.\u201d",
      "Beneath that mask, though, there sometimes lay real cruelty. His tartly unfiltered remarks betrayed a few of his more retrograde convictions. ",

      "On another occasion, he elaborated, \u201cYou\u2019ve got fat mothers with their bags of chips sitting in front of the television and saying that thin models are ugly.\u201d Clearly, he went on to imply, fashion had never been meant for them.",
      "Mr. Lagerfeld was no fan of the #MeToo movement, either, inquiring in an explosive 2018 interview why some women took years to publicly share their stories of sexual assault. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with it,\u201d he told Num\u00e9ro magazine. \u201cWhat shocks me most in all of this are the starlets who have taken 20 years to remember what happened.

      ". \u201cIn the \u201960s, they all said we had the right to the difference. And now, suddenly, they want a bourgeois life.\u201d",

      " stayed home for the Met Gala on Monday, the stars came out in full feline force to make up for her absence. Jared Leto went furry (and slightly terrifying) in a cat suit and Lil Nas X meowed at the press in glittery, full-body crystal makeup and pearly whiskers. For her first Met Gala, the musician Doja Cat went a slightly more understated route, with a high fashion, anthropomorphic cat look that married beauty, camp and glam.",
      "Like Mr. Leto and Lil Nas X, Doja Cat was paying homage to Choupette, Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s beloved Birman cat, in a silvery, beaded Oscar de la Renta gown with a cat-eared hood, a fluffy white train and a cat-face prosthetic. The look was custom-made for the pop star using sea glass and bugle beads that were hand embroidered in a process that took 5,000 hours to create, according to the brand.",

      "Ms. Stearns, a special-effects makeup artist who lives in Los Angeles, said that she and Mr. Nelson first started planning the look about six months ago. To begin, she took a mold of Doja Cat\u2019s face (a process in which Ms. Stearns \u201cslimed her face in silicone,\u201d she said) to sculpt a small foam latex prosthetic for the event. ",
      "\u201cShe wanted to be a cat herself, as like a humanoid kind of cat,\u201d Ms. Stearns said. They did two full run-throughs with the prosthetic and it took about an hour to apply earlier on Monday, as Ms. Stearns carefully positioned and tweaked the piece on Doja Cat\u2019s face. It took additional time to apply her makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole process,\u201d Ms. Stearns said with a laugh.",
      "But compared with Doja Cat\u2019s ",
      " in January, it was almost certainly a breeze. And in terms of wearability, Ms. Stearns said that the cat-face prosthetic is more lightweight and comfortable than one might think, and that Doja Cat had planned to wear it to the dinner and throughout the entire evening of the gala.",
      "It was important that the prosthetic balance the \u201chumanoid\u201d cat vision with beauty. \u201cI still wanted her beauty to shine through,\u201d said Ms. Stearns, who has worked with Doja Cat before on projects including her ",
      " music video. \u201cWe just wanted to pay homage to her being the cat and still kind of keep it in a very beauty world.\u201d ",
      "\u201cIt was nice to take the idea of prosthetics, which is something that\u2019s very strange and weird and not really used in the world of beauty often, but mixing it with beauty,\u201d Mr. Nelson added.",
      "On the carpet, Doja Cat committed to the character by meowing in response to interview questions from ",

      ", Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s feline friend. Kylie Jenner, Gabrielle Union, Salma Hayek Pinault and Pedro Pascal stood out in hot reds, and Lil Nas X stole the show in silver body paint and not much else.",
      "There were many wonderful dresses that paid respect to Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s legacy \u2014 in fact, there were too many to name. There were also many looks that just looked great (Halle Bailey, Camila Morrone, Naomi Campbell, Keke Palmer and Aurora James just to name a few).

      ".",
      "\u201cClutching of the pearls\u201d was one of the driving ideas behind her heavily beaded look from Schiaparelli, Ms. Coel said. And, wow, were there plenty of pearls \u2014 and stones, and crystals, and gold work \u2014 to clutch!",
      "A rain cloud, but make it glittery. Ms. Yai\u2019s gold and silver strapless sequined dress by Prabal Gurung arched out dramatically at her hips, raining down in streams of silver to her feet.",
      "Doja Cat leaned into both her name and the theme, dressing in a homage to Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s famed white cat, Choupette. She wore a backless hooded silver gown from Oscar de la Renta with a white feather train. The best part of the look, though, was plastered to her face: custom feline prosthetics.",
      "Don\u2019t step on Bad Bunny\u2019s train, but do get on board with it. The musician\u2019s white suit from Simon Porte Jacquemus was giving business in the front, party in the back. Or backless, as it were, as the jacket had a large cutout.",
      "Like many, the evening\u2019s co-chair opted to go straight to the source, wearing a white tweed Chanel gown styled after one model Claudia Schiffer donned in 1992. (Check the pockets!) Bonus points to Ms. Lipa for styling it with some subtle, understated jewelry, a Tiffany diamond necklace weighing in at just 100 carats.",
      "Fans will have immediately spotted the link between Ms. Bridgers\u2019s signature skeleton suit and her Met gown from Tory Burch. On Monday, the musician traded up her usual bones for, fittingly, a black dress studded with strategically positioned pearls.",
      "On a night with no shortage of pearls, Mr. Waititi\u2019s strands \u2014 only two slung from his neck and dangling all the way to just below his hips \u2014 fell over a long pearlescent gray tuxedo jacket by Prabal Gurung.",
      "Her white Chanel gown was elongated by sparkly columns of paneling, but the most notable part of her ensemble was a white-feathered cape that she flapped for extra drama. Reminiscent of an angel, one might say.",
      "Mr. Henry\u2019s look for the evening had other lovely elements \u2014 pearls among them, of course \u2014 but the most important of them was his cape, piled high with artfully structured black ruffles.",
      "There are plenty of things one could write about Mr. Pascal\u2019s red and black color-blocked pairing on Monday night, but let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019re all just thinking about the shorts.",
      "The musician\u2019s entire body \u2014 save for a thong \u2014 was covered in silver paint and rhinestones, like a high fashion Tin Man via Pat McGrath. Someone please snap a photo of his seat after dinner.",
      "Arriving at 10:15 p.m. as only she could and get away with, Rihanna stepped onto the carpet looking rather, well, elliptical tucked inside a cream-colored egg of camellias from Valentino. How was she feeling? \u201cExpensive,\u201d she said.",
      "Mr. Leto assumed the role of mascot in a giant white cat costume, another nod to Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s beloved pet. After he had sufficiently scared the press corps, he removed the costume, revealing pale blue eye shadow that matched the cat\u2019s oversized eyes.",
      "What started out as an oversized tweed overcoat ended as a black, sparkly bikini as Ms. Mon\u00e1e revealed layer after layer \u2014 including a giant hoop skirt \u2014 of Thom Browne. (Which might have taken the prize for least clothes on the carpet were Lil Nas X not in attendance.)",
      "The musician\u2019s sheer black corset dress from Simone Rocha matched her hair, which was flanked by sparkly black barrettes on either side of her face. A departure from last year\u2019s blond bombshell look.",

The couple was accompanied by Baz Luhrmann and his wife, Catherine Martin.",
      "For the cameras, Ms. Kidman, with her long, strawberry blond locks, in a swath of peachy fabric, seemed to float toward Mr. Luhrmann\u2019s side, in front of a towering centerpiece featuring hundreds of one-liter plastic bottles sourced from a recycling plant.",
      "The light of many flash bulbs reflected off the bottles, lighting Mr. Luhrmann\u2019s face as he fluffed Ms. Kidman\u2019s train, gesturing with his hands, softly, toward her face. Ms. Kidman, who starred in Mr. Luhrmann\u2019s films \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d and \u201cAustralia,\u201d poked her chin up, meeting the director\u2019s hand in midair.",
      "The role of muse is one Ms. Kidman knows well: She was also one of Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s muses, though she humbly deflected about the title when asked if she considered herself as such, preferring to talk about how much he taught her.",
      "\u201cI stood there, you know, in my lingerie while he designed my dress,\u201d Ms. Kidman said about Mr. Lagerfeld, ",
      ", as she exited the exhibition and headed to the cocktail party in the American Wing of the museum. She clutched the train of her dress, designed by Mr. Lagerfeld for a Chanel No. 5 commercial Mr. Luhrmann directed. \u201cKarl knew me and he was able to design for me, but he was also really playful and fun. It was just lovely in the same way as being around someone like Stanley Kubrick.\u201d",
      "Supermodels like Kate Moss cherished the intimacy they shared with Mr. Lagerfeld. Ms. Moss recalled working with the designer, as well as his infamous largess.",
      "\u201cTo sit at the desk with Karl Lagerfeld as he sketched was the most incredible thing,\u201d Ms. Moss said, as she entered the exhibit with her daughter, Lila Moss, wearing a Fendi dress. \u201cHe was so generous with his passion.\u201d",
      "Naomi Campbell, who walked in Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s runway shows and shot ad campaigns with him, also relished the bond she shared with Mr. Lagerfeld. As she walked through the exhibition, ",
      " her knee-length dark hair contrasted with the stark white walls.",
      "\u201cIf I could describe our relationship, it was fun, witty, intelligent, never a dull moment, so creative, risk-taking and caring,\u201d she said, wearing a satin pink and silver Chanel dress from the 2010 couture collection. One thing she loved about Mr. Lagerfeld? \u201cHe was very honest: He did not suffer fools.\u201d",
      "Ms. Campbell is proud of having been Mr. Lagerfeld\u2019s muse because it allowed her to watch him conceive an idea and bring it to life, she said.",

      "Unlike Ms. Campbell, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, who wore archival Chanel from the 2007 bridal collection, has never considered herself a muse. She felt too tomboyish to see herself in that context, but she has muses of her own, she said.",
      "\u201cMy muse is my mom and my grandma because they are incredible women who show me the values that carry me throughout my life,\u201d Ms. B\u00fcndchen said as she walked through the exhibit in a feathery white Chanel cape with a train that dragged a foot behind her and laid over a sequined white Chanel dress.",
      "The Oscar-nominated actor Bryan Tyree Henry said that he also considered his mother his muse. \u201cMy mother was my muse for most of my life, still is,\u201d said Mr. Henry, who wore a collaborative piece from the Karl Lagerfeld bridal collection. \u201cShe was one of the most fashionable people I ever saw. From her jewelry to her rings or shoes, I was enamored with everything that she picked and how she walked in this world.\u201d",
      "The designer Tom Ford believes muses are important, even more so for male designers of women\u2019s clothes. \u201cOh my God, I have so many muses,\u201d Mr. Ford said as he walked past a row of waiters in white tuxedos and away from the bar, fizzy drink in hand. \u201cI would say I have two main muses, Carine Roitfeld and Lisa Eisner. They represent very different sides of my own personal taste, and both were quite different.\u201d",
      "While Mr. Ford can narrow it down to two women, the Nigerian singer Tems, who wore a feathered Robert Wun gown, said she finds creative inspiration in everyone.",
      "\u201cWe gain inspiration from everybody \u2014 it\u2019s a universal thing.\u201d Tems said, while chatting with Gabrielle Union, who wore a red Prada get-up. \u201cWe are all connected. You can see somebody right now, and then you gain inspiration from that. We are all muses in our own right, whether we know it or not.\u201d"

      "In northern Maine, when the last of the wildflowers go golden on their stems \u2014 when the temperatures dip, fishermen pull their traps from the water, hunters wait in the woods and farmers gather the final crops \u2014 the time finally comes for \u201ctipping,\u201d or, as the old-timers call it, \u201cbrushing.\u201d This is the time of year when folks head into the woods to gather the ends of evergreen branches for use in wreaths and holiday trimmings.",
      "Ten-year-old Harbor Eaton lives with her family on ",
      " on Maine\u2019s Schoodic Peninsula. The Eaton family primarily grows produce crops, but balsam-harvesting and wreath-making is a way of extending the farm\u2019s production into the colder, darker seasons. In November and December, Harbor goes out tipping with her family and farm workers on adjacent woodlots, with the aid of their horses, Andy and Starr.",
      "\u201cYou go out into the woods, try to find a tree with good foliage. You take a branch, snap it and make sure it doesn\u2019t have brown spots on it \u2014 \u2019cause you don\u2019t want a brown wreath,\u201d Harbor explained.",
      "Cedar, Harbor\u2019s 7-year-old brother, said that the trick is to use a stick that\u2019s sharpened on one end \u2014 with four branch stubs sticking out \u2014 to stack and collect the boughs into a portable unit.",
      "\u201cDo that over and over till you have filled the stick with branches,\u201d Cedar said. \u201cThen you put the stick on the wagon. You do it all over again until the horses pull us home with all the full sticks.\u201d",
      "Balsam-harvesting is a welcome change of pace for farmers at the end of the season\u2019s crescendo. \u201cAfter spending the majority of our time focusing our energy on the soil and working looking down, we get into the woods and just stare at the trees, looking up toward the sky,\u201d said Liz Moran, who manages Darthia Farm and raises Harbor and Cedar with her partner, Steve Eaton, known as Shepsi.",
      "The process of tipping is hard work: the physical picking and pulling, the weight of the heavy branches. Tippers also need to keep an ear out for hunters in the forests, and pull off ticks at day\u2019s end. But Ms. Moran describes a certain magic about the work: bringing warm treats to eat, noticing the soft patterns in the branches, letting the children play as they work, listening for the barred owl that lives near the entrance of the woodlot. The crew sometimes sing while they work, their voices echoing off the trees.",
      "\u201cThe woods offer such a different acoustic environment than the open gardens and fields,\u201d Mr. Eaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to hear each other in the woods if we are singing.\u201d",
      "In Maine, especially in the state\u2019s Downeast region, generations of people have built lives on seasonal, nature-based work: digging clams, pulling traps on commercial fishing boats, raking blueberries, processing seafood and crops. Harvesting balsam and making wreaths play important roles in this cycle.",
      "Geri Valentine started making wreaths in the 1970s, and it\u2019s still a part of her patchwork of seasonal jobs. As she wire-wrapped handfuls of evergreen around metal rings in a cozy cabin on Darthia Farm, she recalled her early days as a wreather. \u201cBack then, it was mostly a cottage industry \u2014 people would go out in family groups to gather brush,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople like clam diggers and fishermen would go out brushing after the fishing season was over, and it was a way to bring in some income, especially right before Christmas, heading into the lean months.\u201d",
      "Ms. Valentine has chosen a simple life. She lives in a cabin in the town of Addison without electricity and running water; she grows her own food with friends; she drives a used car. \u201cI don\u2019t want very much,\u201d she said. \u201cI change my jobs with the seasons.\u201d",
      "\u201cLiving this way feels very grounded,\u201d she continued. These days, though, people can\u2019t survive as easily on seasonal work, she said. \u201cIf you have a truck payment, if you\u2019ve got a mortgage, if you want to send your kids to college, you can\u2019t swing a life of digging clams in the summer and making wreaths for Christmastime.\u201d",
      "When you talk to locals, they agree: The systems have changed. The bigger wreath manufacturers, including Kelco Industries, Worcester Wreath Co. and Whitney Wreath, likely made the ones you find at your local grocery store or in catalogs. By some estimates, such companies employ about 2,000 migrant workers to harvest materials and work in wreath factories in Downeast Maine \u2014 often the same workers who harvested wild blueberries in summer and who returned to Maine for wreath season.",
      "Among the migrant workers, there have been growing concerns about low wages, substandard housing, exploitative work conditions and a lack of access to health care and education. Nonprofits like ",
      " and the ",
      " provide support to seasonal workers, including those employed by the wreath industry.",
      "This year, local nonprofits collaborated with farmers to gather warm clothes, blankets and supplies for wreath workers who are often unprepared for the cold of New England in November and December. Mounds of donated goods piled up at drop-off sites \u2014 enough that Bo Dennis, a flower farmer and organizer, borrowed a clean cattle trailer to carry it all to Mano en Mano\u2019s office in Milbridge.",
      "Mr. Dennis grows flowers at his farm, ",
      ", in Monroe, Maine, and is also on staff at ",
      ", where he works on programs for beginner farmers. He offers his farmland for other queer farmers to find an entry point to agriculture and rural life. He\u2019s tuned in to the networks of people and plants around him and the ways they may need support \u2014 and this mind-set extends to the forests.",
      "\u201cWhen we harvest, we are pruning a tree,\u201d Mr. Dennis said, explaining that tippers only cut the last 12 to 15 inches of a tree branch \u2014 a sustainable practice. He loaded heavy bags of boughs into his truck, all harvested from a friend\u2019s woodlot, a chunk of clear-cut land that had grown in with thick, scrubby trees.",
      "Mr. Dennis mainly harvests balsam fir, supplemented with cedar, pine and juniper. He is careful about where he harvests, and on whose land. \u201cAs a trans person, I\u2019m hyper-aware that I want to have consent with anything I\u2019m doing, including having consent to the land,\u201d he said.",
      "By percentage, Maine is the most forested state in America; about ",
      ", most of which is privately owned. Independent tippers usually (but ",
      ") get permission from private landowners to gather materials on their land \u2014 and, as with deer hunters or wild mushroom gatherers, tippers often know whom to ask and where to find what they need.",
      ", a forager and artist who uses the name Giant Daughter, looks in a variety of places: overgrown properties that might benefit from pruning, weedy land, areas with trees too thick for them all to thrive. \u201cI also harvest at abandoned sites,\u201d she said, \u201clike an abandoned Burger King that no one is tending to.\u201d",
      "Ms. Alexandrou uses her background in horticulture and farming to influence the ways she gathers her materials. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be taking away,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be using what makes sense to use.\u201d",
      "\u201cI pay attention to the way the plants are growing so that I know my harvesting is good for the ecosystem I\u2019m harvesting from,\u201d she added.",
      "Most tippers will wait for three hard frosts before they harvest. If you bend a balsam bough in the summer, it won\u2019t snap; after a few frosts, it will. The frost allows the branches to be harvested easily, at the right time in the tree\u2019s growth cycle. This year, though, the frosts were worryingly erratic. It was warm enough to harvest in a T-shirt on some days.",
      "Weather patterns, tides, fish, frosts, deer \u2014 these can be the favored conversational subjects in rural Maine. Tipping, too, offers common ground.",
      "\u201cI may have nothing to do with someone most of the year,\u201d Mr. Eaton said, \u201cbut if I\u2019m tipping, there is much to relate to.\u201d",
      "Every so often, while working in the woods, the tippers stop to smell their hands. They smell like pitch, like the inside of trees. Dirt mingles with the sap. I see it over and over: tippers cupping their palms to their face and pulling pine needles from their hair. The smell is earthy and nostalgic. The wreaths will smell this way, too: joyful circles on front doors across the country, formed by the work of strangers, and made from trees that continue to grow."

      "As spring bursts forth, wild turkeys begin the mating game. Groups congregate in lawns and fields \u2014 and sometimes in the middle of the street. Males puff out their iridescent feathers, fan their tails and drag their wings on the ground in a vie for the right to breed. Their faces and necks turn dazzling shades of blue and red.",
      "Once rare and elusive denizens of America\u2019s woodlands, these heaviest of the galliform birds (chickens and their relatives) have gone urban. Wild turkeys live in the residential neighborhoods around my home in Madison, Wis.",
      "A few years ago, their elaborate courtship displays fascinated me so much that I began to photograph them \u2014 and, as I\u2019ve learned, there\u2019s more happening than meets the eye.",
      "For starters, turkeys of a feather flock together. Males, known as toms, can form lifelong flocks with their brothers. Dr. Alan Krakauer, a ",
      " and fellow ",
      ", studied this as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He ",
      " that toms in a flock were anywhere from full to half-siblings. These bands of brothers cooperated to court females, or hens, and chase off competing males.",
      "Remarkably, though, only the dominant male mated and fathered offspring. The subordinate brothers served as \u201cwingmen,\u201d \u201cbodyguards,\u201d or \u201cbackup dancers,\u201d to use Dr. Krakauer\u2019s colorful descriptions. \u201cThey have what I think of as a support role,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite the potential for lifelong celibacy, wingmen benefited from the arrangement, Dr. Krakauer found \u2014 at least by the raw calculus of evolution. On average, dominant males with wingmen produced seven offspring a season, whereas solo males produced fewer than one. Since the males were closely related, those seven offspring contained more of the wingmen\u2019s genes than if they\u2019d sired a single chick themselves.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re helping their brother get a lot more females than either of them would get on their own, so this cooperation seemed particularly helpful,\u201d explained Dr. Krakauer. \u201cThat seemed to be surprising for people at the time.\u201d",
      "Anyone who\u2019s had a brother knows the vicissitudes of fraternal relations. While brothers generally cooperate during the mating season, intense fighting breaks out at other times, as they jostle for rank. Turkeys have formidable weapons: large bodies, powerful wings and spurred feet. On one occasion, I saw a fight so violent that spittle flew \u2014 like when a boxer is hit by a knockout punch.",
      "While males are aggressive with each other, they aren\u2019t aggressive toward females and do not force copulations, despite being twice the size of their mating partners. So while males may strut with abandon, females ultimately choose their mates. They\u2019re picky about partners and know what they want: males with long snoods.",
      "Snoods are the fingerlike fleshy protuberances that flop over a turkey\u2019s beak. The animals can contract and relax muscles and blood vessels in their head and neck, causing changes in the organ\u2019s length and color. A tom sporting a long red snood draws the attention of hens like flies to honey \u2014 although, to their credit, the hens manage to be coy about it.",
      "Dr. Richard Buchholz, ",
      " at the University of Mississippi, has spent his career studying wild turkeys. He examined the role that various male ornaments \u2014 including snoods, caruncles (pebble-like bumps on the head and neck), skullcaps (thickened skin on top of the head), spurs (talons on the legs) and beards (tufts of hairlike feathers projecting from the chest) \u2014 play in female mate choice. He ",
      " that snood length was the primary factor that explained which male a female chose as a mate. Even a few extra millimeters made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt did surprise me, especially since the snood doesn\u2019t seem to be a very functional thing to choose,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. \u201cWhy the snood and not all the other ornaments on males?\u201d",
      "The answer lies in a phenomenon with deep roots in biology: Fancy accouterments may indicate good genes. For turkeys, a male who can afford to sport a killer snood must have had ample resources, which ostensibly reflects the quality of his DNA. Dr. Buchholz found that males with longer snoods had fewer coccidia parasites, which don\u2019t harm adults but can sicken or kill chicks, and ",
      " that may make them resistant to coccidia.",
      "\u201cEarly on there\u2019s probably a big impact on chick survival,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said, so by choosing longer-snooded males, females may provide their babies with lifesaving parasite resistance.",
      "Dr. Buchholz is still uncertain about the role some other male ornaments play. Like snoods, other fleshy structures on a turkey\u2019s face and neck can change color during displays. For example, males will drain all the blood from the caruncles so they\u2019re as white as a sheet of paper, Dr. Buchholz said. He remains unsure of what the change in the caruncles might signal, or why it\u2019s important.",
      "And what about those fancy feathers? \u201cI don\u2019t know if females care,\u201d Dr. Buchholz said. The feathers of male turkeys infected with coccidia ",
      ", which turkeys (but not we humans) can see. However, no one has studied whether females scoff at dull feathers the way they do at puny snoods.",
      "There\u2019s still a lot to learn about wild turkey mating behavior. \u201cFor a bird that\u2019s such a great conservation success story, that\u2019s so common and interesting to people, and that has a cultural connection to the American Thanksgiving, for us to not know more about its behavior is really a shame,\u201d said Dr. Buchholz.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s not entirely surprising. Wild turkey populations are currently ",
      " in many parts of the country, thanks to conservation efforts; in places like New England, Madison and Berkeley, they\u2019re now so common that they get about as much notice from passing motorists as a traffic cone.",
      "But that wasn\u2019t always the case. Until recently, wild turkeys were rare in the United States \u2014 \u201cwhich seems crazy now,\u201d Dr. Krakauer said, \u201csince they\u2019re right in town and blocking traffic.\u201d"

I settled into the moody, retro atmosphere, watching people buy cheap drinks and looking nostalgically at the arcade games on offer: Ms. Pac-Man, Gun Fight, Track & Field, Paperboy.",

Ms. Osorio began naming a few birds we\u2019d spotted that afternoon, and soon bird names were ricocheting from seat to seat, a cheery distraction from the precipitous view and the gloomy prospect of getting stranded overnight in an ecosystem comparable to the Arctic tundra. Mr. Barrera contacted the ",
      "; they dispatched a car and two trucks to our rescue, arriving just as night fell.",
      "As we careened through the winding mountain pass of Paso Pallapacta, the light rain switched to blinding fog and sleet. We slid past accidents, breakdowns, police cars, white roadside crosses.",
      "The next morning we were back in the P\u00e1ramo, having packed rubber boots for mud, ponchos for rain, quick-drying pants and socks and, of course, binoculars. Alexis was still adjusting to the roughly 11,000-foot altitude; I felt fine, if a little tired.",
      "The sky was overcast and clouds clung to rocky ledges as we hiked past a primary forest of knobby, slow-growing Polylepis trees that, according to Mr. Panama, had provided habitats for birds in that inhospitable climate for 20,000 to 40,000 years. Rain clicked on electrical wires above us. Cliffs seemed to exhale steam.",
      "Touching a ravaged heart of palm, Mr. Panama observed that a bear had recently been feeding there. I spotted a brown chestnut-winged cinclodes with a little pointy beak, and a slate-blue plumbeous sierra finch with pink legs. Seeing me struggle with my new binoculars, Mr. Barrera kindly removed one of the lens caps.",
      "At our second stop, a spectacled bear, black with goggle-shaped white markings around its eyes, tore through the mist and down a hill, taking shelter behind a cluster of boulders.",
      "Ms. Osorio was ecstatic. \u201cThis is a rare sight!\u201d she cried. \u201cAlexis did you see it? Dorothy, did you see it?\u201d",
      "A black-and-chestnut eagle \u2014 among the most endangered birds of prey in South America \u2014 flew in circles above us, calling. We admired its beautiful black crest and impressive wingspan before it swooped into the canopy. There are only about a thousand left in the world, Mr. Barrera said, in Spanish, tapping his baseball cap. The black-and-chestnut eagle was the logo for his tour company.",
      "The eagle\u2019s strong talons had evolved to pluck red squirrels and small monkeys from trees, Mr. Panama said. \u201cBut now they\u2019ve begun to eat chickens. People think they\u2019re bad luck. So, they kill them.\u201d",
      "When we returned to the lodge for lunch, a fire crackled in the hearth. We sat down at our long communal table to a traditional soup made with peanuts, followed by chicken curry with steamed cauliflower and sweet potato chips. After dinner, staff would pass out hot water bottles in knitted sacks to heat our bedsheets. Guango was rustic, and the rooms were small, but the place had heart.",
      "On our third morning, we watched a breathtaking assortment of hummingbirds buzz around feeders. A hen-like Andean guan and her chicks were perched on a high branch. Two parent torrent ducks taught their chick how to swim in the rapids of the Rio Guango. Afterward we were back in our minibus, chugging above cliffs, in and out of clouds.",
      "Olaf showed us his target list for the first part of our trip. One page long, single-spaced, it named each bird in Latin and English, along with where it was most often spotted and possible locations of where it may be found. The punishing conditions of the high Andes made for far fewer bird species, he explained. \u201cWait until the lower elevations,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cMy lists are two and three times this.\u201d",
      "I gazed out the window. Stunning waterfalls glistened like long needles in the mountainside forest across from us, and the River Quijos cut like a razor through the wooded valley below. But there were an alarming number of oil tanks and storage facilities closer to the road. And a rusted pipeline transporting crude oil up from the Amazon ran alongside the road toward Quito. One portion of pipe bore a graffiti message that translated into \u201cNo more Texaco. Respect and repair.\u201d",
      "On a wide deck that wrapped around the main lodge at ",
      ", Alexis and I sampled fresh-pressed juices. Two russet-colored woodcreepers nipped insects with their long sturdy bills as they marched up and down tree trunks. Green-winged Inca jays, with yellow bellies and black-and-blue faces, fluttered and squawked in nearby branches, and a dazzling array of hummingbirds purred and thumped, jostling for space at assorted feeders.",
      "Mr. Panama spotted a masked trogon perched on a branch. Its red belly and green throat, improbably paired with a black-and-white pinstriped undertail, were all in perfect view when he casually reached for my iPhone to tap an elegant photo through his spotting scope. The mist lifted over the valley. At his suggestion, we hiked to a waterfall near his friend\u2019s reforestation project, where we each planted a native tree.",
      "But I\u2019d just as soon have stayed at San Isidro, the most comfortable of our four lodges, whose spacious cabins each boasted a hammock hanging from a small porch \u2014 some with stunning views. There were miles of fantastic hiking trails on its 4,400-acre property, which bridged two parts of the ",
      ". One trail led to a river with a sandy beach, another to a waterfall. Still another led through primary, uncut forest, where lush ferns draped along branches like drying laundry, and night monkeys crept along the treetops, and a summer tanager devoured a moth, scattering its wings like confetti through the air.",
      "One afternoon, a group of us \u2014 everyone except Mr. Panama and Olaf, who were checking off birds, and our friend Steve, who was recovering from a medical issue and sticking closer to the lodge \u2014 followed Ben Lucking, a volunteer at the lodge, down a trail, where we discovered two brilliant red-orange male Andean cocks-of-the-rock braying across the canopy in full territorial display, their oddly shaped and overstuffed crests bobbing emphatically as they hopped from branch to branch.",
      "It was a bucket-list bird for most of us, and particularly gratifying for our friend Martha, a retired hospice social worker, who had privileged hope over knee pain on the muddy hike down.",
      "Before we arrived at our next stop, ",
      ", in the eastern foothills of the Andes, Mr. Panama passed some loose change to our bus driver, Darwin Vera, who bought a handful of long green pods from a roadside stand. Mr. Panama opened a pod and passed it around, and we sucked on the sweet pulp of ice cream beans.",
      "Wild Sumaco was named after the 13,000-foot volcano that can be seen looming in the distance. The main lodge resembled a huge log cabin, with high ceilings and a big corner fireplace. The food was good, and the proprietor had a sense of humor, appearing on the wide-open veranda one morning while holding a three-foot earthworm, which Alexis immediately grabbed, delighted, as it hung from his fist, undulating like a live rope.",
      "Donning headlamps, we spent a fun night spotting small frogs, snakes and spiders. We saw our first chestnut-eared aracari, a kind of toucan with a signature blue patch around its eye. We also spotted six large black-mandibled toucans feeding in the treetops, their long banana-shaped, yellow-and-black beaks upturned as they called to each other. Seeing a yellow-tufted woodpecker poke holes in a dead palm, Mr. Panama explained that macaws and other birds would eventually make nests there. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of vertical biodiversity,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cOr a high-rise,\u201d joked Alexis.",
      "But after the comfort of San Isidro, the rooms at Wild Sumaco felt more in keeping with a motel. And beyond the lodge\u2019s lush rainforest property, the expanding wildlife was under increasing threat from loggers.",
      "In the somewhat downtrodden oil-industry city of Coca, we bid farewell to Mr. Panama and Mr. Vera. After a night at a utilitarian hotel, we met Mr. Gualinga and his cousin, Gustavo Javier Andy, our guides for the duration of our stay at ",
      ", at the city dock.",
      "The three-hour ride in a motorized canoe along the Rio Napo was broken up by two stops. At the first, we got lucky: Two magnificent harpy eagles high in the canopy were carrying clusters of dried branches to their growing nest in the crown of a ceiba tree. The world\u2019s most powerful bird of prey, the harpy\u2019s wingspan measures up to six-and-a-half feet, and its massive body and four-inch talons are perfect for plucking up monkeys and sloths.",
      "Ms. Osorio burst into tears. Harpy eagles had been spotted along the river a couple of years ago, Mr. Gualinga said, adding that he\u2019d seen them on trips to the area in recent months.",
      "After another bird-filled stop, where we saw our first turkey-like hoatzin \u2014 whose ungainly size and clumsy movements made us all laugh \u2014 we were transferred into two smaller canoes. Mr. Gualinga, Mr. Andy and two additional oarsmen paddled us \u2014 so as not to disturb the wildlife with a motor \u2014 the final 45 minutes, until the Sani Lodge came into view on the far bank of a wide lagoon, Chaluacocha, named after a smallmouth fish native to the area.",
      "As we paddled up to the dock, members of Sani\u2019s staff welcomed us with cocktails of lime-juice, vodka and blue cura\u00e7ao that made our teeth blue. Mr. Gualinga gave a brief introduction in the lodge\u2019s airy open bar. We smiled our blue smiles, happy but weary after a long day, then retreated to our respective thatched cabins, with their lovely polished-wood floors, rotating fans and white towels folded like origami birds on the beds. The canopies were draped with mosquito netting that would be neatly tucked around our mattresses when we returned from dinner.",
      "We spent five blissful days at Sani Lodge, which is owned and operated by the Indigenous Sani tribe. We watched the sun rise over the jungle from a 120-foot-high metal platform \u2014 Mr. Gualinga helped build it when he was 14, he said \u2014 in the crown of a 900-year-old ceiba tree, and waited for scarlet macaws to descend upon a clay-lick to eat minerals that neutralize toxins in their diet. For lunch one day we took instruction from a group of Sani Village mamitas in the community center, folding tilapia and heart of palm into long, green rumi panka leaves, which we then roasted over an open fire, along with two types of plantains and chontacuro beetle larvae. We paddled through flooded forests looking for anacondas and fished for piranhas along a small creek.",
      "Yes, the Wi-Fi at the lodge was spotty. And no, there was no pool. By this point, Olaf had pretty much gone rogue, disappearing with Mr. Gualinga and another rower before the rest of us met for breakfast, and returning long after lunch, only to head out again on his own, returning after we\u2019d finished dinner.",
      "One morning, Martha and I were gazing through our binoculars at a marvelous paradise tanager \u2014 green, blue and red \u2014 when I was filled with a kind of piercing joy that had been sneaking up on me at odd moments. \u201cThis trip is particularly poignant for me,\u201d Martha said, \u201cbecause it may be the last time I see a lot of these birds in the wild.\u201d I put my arm around her, considering this.",
      "Birding is not for everyone. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s for me. What ",
      " for me, however, is experiencing the natural world in all its richness and wonder, and seeing how other people live, and hearing their stories, all while understanding how very different we may be, and also how very similar.",
      "By then, I\u2019d gotten used to my binoculars. I\u2019d also noticed that when Mr. Gualinga tracked a bird, he moved low and quiet through the forest, whistling softly, as if speaking directly to the bird until it responded, when he\u2019d stand very still on one leg, while slowly motioning for us to come look.",
      "On our last morning, as we headed back to Coca in our motorized canoe, Mr. Andy smiled gamely in the driving rain as he pushed large Styrofoam containers packed with our breakfast \u2014 fresh fruit, scrambled eggs and toast \u2014 to the front of our boat. He then handed them out, a parody of a flight attendant on an airplane. Passing around ceramic cups wrapped in napkins, he poured hot coffee from a thermos and offered spoons of sugar to anyone who wanted it. Our alternative to tea in the Sahara was coffee in the Amazon in a torrential downpour. I smiled out at the rain. I am the rain, I thought. I am rain."

      "No royal heir in British history has waited longer than Charles III, the king formerly known as the Prince of Wales, to ascend the throne. When he is officially crowned, on May 6, Charles will be 74 years old \u2014 a full 47 years older than his mother, Elizabeth II, was at her own coronation way back in the mid-20th century.",
      "A lot has changed in the monarchy, and in the monarch, since the early days of the queen\u2019s reign. Elizabeth came to the top job through accidents of history and fate. Her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936, disrupting the normal order of succession; her father, George VI, succeeded him but died 16 years later at the age of 56, propelling Elizabeth onto the throne. By contrast, Charles \u2014 the oldest Prince of Wales in British history to become king \u2014 was born a monarch-in-waiting and has had a lifetime to prepare.",
      "The public in turn has had a lifetime to get to know Charles, starting from his rarefied childhood in the public eye. We had a ringside seat at his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in 1997; we followed his affair with and eventual marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles; we saw his struggles with his second son, Prince Harry, in an ongoing saga that is bound to spill over into the coronation, which Harry is scheduled to attend without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "By tradition, heirs to the throne don\u2019t meddle in unroyal matters. But Charles was an unusually outspoken Prince of Wales. He is known as a lover of classical music, a student of philosophy and world religions and a proponent of sometimes controversial ideas. He has often waded into debates on unexpected topics like alternative medicine and organic farming (pro) and modernist architecture (against).",
      "In London alone, there are plenty of royal spots to visit (Kensington Palace and Westminster Abbey, for starters), royal-themed exhibits to explore (",
      " at Madame Tussauds) and coronation-themed walking tours through this most inviting of cities.",
      "But for visitors interested in exploring the history and psyche of the new king, here are some stops on an alternative royal tour in and around the city.",
      "Charles bought Highgrove House, a Georgian neo-Classical estate in Gloucestershire, in 1980, before he married Diana. He saw it as a refuge, a bolt-hole in which he could pursue country pleasures and contemplate the beauty of nature; she found it boring and preferred the city. More and more, it became the place where he arranged discreet trysts with Camilla Parker Bowles.",
      "The house \u2014 reachable by bus from London, or by taking a train to Kemble, and then a taxi \u2014 is closed to outsiders. But the grounds are ",
      " each April through October. Until the end of May, there\u2019s also an exhibition at the Garrison Chapel in Chelsea, London, ",
      ",\u201d that lets you appreciate the gardens without leaving the city.",
      "The exhibition demonstrates how fully the gardens embody Charles\u2019s philosophical and aesthetic preoccupations: his love of nature, his passion for tradition, his enthusiasm for artisanal crafts. There\u2019s a winsome photo of him on his knees weeding, and several never-before-seen princely watercolors and sketches. Charles is said to have even personally planted much of the thyme in what is known as the ",
      ".",
      "The gardens consist of a number of interconnected parts and you can see photographs of them all here, including the flower-dotted ",

As Charles once said: \u201cI never underestimate the value of the \u2018golden hoof\u2019 in the great scheme of biodiversity.\u201d",
      "When Charles was still an unhappy student in a remote Scottish boarding school, a high-level committee decreed that, in a break with tradition, he should continue his education instead of going directly into the military. Thus he became the first Prince of Wales ever to receive a university degree.",
      "The young prince was sent to Trinity, the richest of Cambridge University\u2019s 31 colleges. His life there was hardly normal. Isolated by temperament and position from most of the other students, Charles frequently repaired to the countryside for shooting weekends and to London for cultural and state functions. (He also studied for some months in Wales in preparation for his formal ",
      " at ",
      ", a medieval fortress in northwest Wales.) According to ",
      " in The Times, Charles did give student life a go. He sang, acted, contributed to the university magazine, played polo against Oxford, took an evening pottery course and went on an archaeological dig with other students to the island of Jersey.",
      "You can visit the princely academic habitat by taking the hour-or-so-long train ride from London to Cambridge; Trinity is a short cab ride into town. Founded by Henry VIII in 1546, the college is impressively grand, due in part to its ",

But visitors can approach from the back, walking along a network of college-owned lawns across the Cam River, and peer in through the formidable gates. There the college porters, resplendent in bowler hats, will be happy to share royal and other tidbits.",
      "Charles, a devotee of traditional building materials and traditional buildings, has spent many years attacking what he sees as the scourge of modernist architecture. In 1984, he managed to offend many members of the London architectural establishment by denouncing their work in ",
      ".",

There is Hill House in West London, where he went to elementary school, and the Tower of London, where many of his family\u2019s jewels are on display.

      ", after his wife. But mostly the town is an exercise in soft-power royalty. The traditional building materials, the human-scale architecture, the master plan by the modernist-eschewing Luxembourgish architect L\u00e9on Krier, the harmonious aesthetic in the prettily painted front doors, the artisanal shops \u2014 all these reflect Charles\u2019s values and philosophy.",
      "Take the train to Dorchester South, hop on a bus to Poundbury and disembark at the square, identifiable by the huge Queen Mother statue. Walk down the street in any direction to get the feel of the place.",

There is no litter. There are few pedestrians and very little noise.",
      "Poundbury\u2019s residents are zealous converts to this way of living. Outsiders have been less enthusiastic. The town has been compared to a Potemkin village, to Brigadoon, to a \u201cfeudal Disneyland\u201d and to the town in the movie \u201cThe Truman Show.\u201d",

      "Flags and royal emblems are already adorning the streets of London as it prepares to celebrate Britain\u2019s first coronation in 70 years with great pomp and spectacle.",
      "The three-day affair will include a royal procession through central London, a celebrity-studded concert at Windsor Castle, and a national holiday on May 8, as well as street parties across the country.",
      "Areas around Buckingham Palace and the central route known as the Mall are already \u201ccrammed with people,\u201d said Patricia Yates, the chief executive of VisitBritain, the national tourism agency. \u201cThere\u2019s a real interest,\u201d she added.",
      "U.S. travelers \u2014 Britain\u2019s biggest inbound market \u2014 are expected to lead next week\u2019s swell of arrivals. Flight bookings from the United States to Britain are about 10 percent higher in May compared with May 2019, before the pandemic, according to VisitBritain. According to Hopper, the booking app, they are also more expensive \u2014 round-trip airfares from the United States to London over coronation weekend averaged $733 in mid-April, 21 percent higher than a year earlier.",
      "After the coronation dates were announced, searches for Airbnb rentals in London during the coronation weekend ",
      ", according to the company, which reported U.S. travelers among the top guests in London around the coronation dates, along with travelers from Britain, France, Australia and Germany (the company declined to share booking numbers).",
      "By late March, hotel bookings in London on the booking platform Expedia were 60 percent higher for the coronation weekend compared with the same time last year. By mid-April, rooms were averaging about $350 per night, according to Hopper.",
      "Lana Bennett, the chief executive of Tours International, a British company that runs special interest tours, said U.S. visitors showed high interest in their six-night ",
      ", which Ms. Higgins Horwitz is joining and was sold out by February. \u201cIt shines a light on the country, and it gives people an opportunity to come.\u201d",
      "But not all travelers headed to London over coronation weekend are thrilled.",
      "Laura Aveidi, a youth fitness instructor living in Houston, was disappointed to find out that her family vacation to London, which she booked last July, coincided with the festivities. \u201cThe city is going to be packed and it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d Ms. Aveidi said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t interest us.\u201d",
      "Despite booking early, two separate Airbnb hosts canceled Ms. Aveidi\u2019s reservations in central London, leaving her scrambling. She paid almost double her budget for a third Airbnb at the last minute. Though the company reimbursed her for some of her unexpected costs, Ms. Aveidi said planning the trip was a nightmare. \u201cOne hundred percent we would have changed the dates,\u201d she said. (On coronation day, she and her family are taking a day trip to Liverpool to watch a soccer game instead.)",
      "Even some royal fans who attended the Platinum Jubilee are staying home, in what may be a reflection of Charles historically being ",
      " than his mother, Queen Elizabeth. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have the interest this year,\u201d said Ralph Iantosca, a Texas-based ",
      ", who only has one client visiting London that weekend. \u201cThe ones that did have the interest don\u2019t want crowds.\u201d",
      "For people making a longer journey to attend the coronation, the event is not only a celebration of Charles\u2019s coronation, but a way of connecting to their heritage.",
      "Paul Dabrowa, a biotech company founder who lives in Melbourne, Australia, said that being in London for the coronation is a way for him to honor his own family history. Mr. Dabrowa said his family members were displaced from Poland during World War II and resettled by British law in Australia after the war.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of respect for the monarchy,\u201d he said, adding that he had also attended Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral last September. He has not yet made up his mind about her son, Charles, but will be watching the royal procession on May 6 in central London. \u201cIt\u2019s worth giving him a chance and seeing what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Pranay Manocha, a London-based software engineer, will not be with the crowds cheering.",
      "Mr. Manocha, 43, said that the fanfare is poorly timed, considering the rising cost of living in Britain, which has left many people struggling to afford their grocery bills. Additionally, his grandparents were displaced by the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, a legacy of colonialism: Celebrating an institution that had left lasting pain did not seem right, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be insufferable, almost, to see everybody celebrating the very thing that still hurts,\u201d he said, adding that he would be going hiking in Cornwall on May 6 instead. \u201cI hope that the weather will be nice.\u201d"

      "Were I to write a Mari Sandoz biopic, I\u2019d start with a shadow racing across her desk. I\u2019d start at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 16, 1935. I\u2019d start with a 39-year-old hayseed \u2014 thin as a fence post and prickly as barbed wire \u2014 assaulting her typewriter on the ninth floor of the Nebraska State Capitol as a local bank teller plunges 135 feet to his death on the stone transept below. Perhaps I\u2019d cut to the fingernail marks he left on the observation deck five floors above, or the note he left behind. I\u2019d then creep slowly back up to Sandoz, red hair in a French bun, hands on her hips, standing quietly \u2014 even knowingly \u2014 at the window while her co-workers at the historical society buzz around her.",
      "Roll credits.",
      "Born and raised in the remote ",
      ", roughly 400 miles west of Lincoln, the author Mari Sandoz plowed her way into the literary canon of the Great Plains \u2014 just months after the teller\u2019s leap \u2014 when she finally published ",
      " the biography of her father, a Swiss homesteader. \u201cOn putting down this book,\u201d ",
      ", \u201cone feels that one has read the history of all pioneering.\u201d Before her death from bone cancer in 1966, she would publish 18 more, fiction and nonfiction alike, enshrining her status \u2014 alongside ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and others \u2014 as one of the most cleareyed chroniclers of the American frontier.",
      "I\u2019ve long felt a certain kinship with Sandoz. I, too, fled the Sandhills. I, too, graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I, too, began my writing career in the city. And I, too, sometimes chafe at my New York editors. \u201cDamn it, you and I know the East has long bled the west white, is still doing it, and I\u2019m to distort facts to please a book public,\u201d ",
      " to a friend. \u201cWhy, I\u2019d rather write my own way and dig ditches for my soup and hard tack than write lies for a yacht and sables. Row boat and rabbit\u2019s more my style anyway.\u201d",
      "Sandoz would eventually leave Lincoln, first for Denver and then for New York, but she spent more years in Nebraska\u2019s capital city than anywhere else. And though she criticized Lincoln throughout her career \u2014 calling it \u201cthe last word in decadent middle-class towns\u201d and \u201cparticularly unkind\u201d to writers \u2014 she would eventually soften on the city. Sort of. In a short essay for The Lincoln Star, the former morning newspaper, in 1959, she wrote, \u201cI remember Lincoln as our Greenwich Village,\u201d recalling long hours in cheap coffee shops and the hungry underclass of would-be artists and writers with whom she often commiserated: the poet ",
      ", the philosopher ",
      " and the short-story writer ",
      ", among others.",
      "So here I am, home again, half drunk and squinting beneath the Capitol, hoping to glean something more about Sandoz and the city she so loved to hate, or perhaps so hated to love. I\u2019ve returned to see this sprawling city of roughly 300,000 people \u2014 where the skyline sprouts from the rail yard and the subdivisions spill into the cornfields; where the streets are treed, but the wetlands are paved; where the U.N.L. campus hums in the heart of the city and the Capitol beckons from miles away \u2014 through the eyes of its most vocal and most ambivalent critic.",
      "Concealing a bottle of cheap ros\u00e9, my wife and I crane our necks. We stare. Nebraskans often call the Capitol tower the \u201cPenis of the Plains,\u201d and truthfully, there\u2019s no debating its phallic structure: 15 floors of Indiana limestone standing erect above the city, capped with a dome of golden tiles and \u2014 as if to avoid any confusion \u2014 a 19-foot bronze statue called ",
      " casting his seed to the wind.",
      "But I\u2019m fixated on the teller\u2019s jump, instead. I squint, he falls. I squint, he falls. And I wonder how Sandoz might have interpreted the same. In those hollow hours before she burst onto the national stage, nary a book to her name, rejections mounting like unpaid bills, she must have borne a certain empathy for the bank teller. Her own family worried she might commit suicide, so far adrift from her literary ambitions, and she once wrote that after so many revisions of \u201cOld Jules,\u201d \u201cI could have jumped off the Capitol too, but it wouldn\u2019t have improved the book particularly.\u201d",
      "I squint. She falls.",
      "When I first arrived in Lincoln, I rendezvoused with ",
      ", then 92 and a pioneer of public television, beneath the stone columns of the ",
      ", one of the oldest structures on the U.N.L. campus. It was in the studio below, he told me, in the spring of 1959, that he produced a seven-part series called \u201cCreative Writing With Mari Sandoz\u201d for the university\u2019s educational television station. \u201cI would rather face a rattlesnake than that camera,\u201d he remembered her saying, but as their work together progressed, she slowly began to relax.",
      "\u201cQuite frankly, if there\u2019s one photograph of Mari Sandoz and me that I wish I had,\u201d Mr. Hull said, \u201cit\u2019s of the two of us dangling our legs off the loading dock, both smoking my Pall Malls.\u201d",
      "With an elfish charm and bushy white eyebrows, Mr. Hull neatly unpacked his memories of the author: her generosity with students, her underdog complex, her staunch liberalism, her retreat to New York and, finally, Nebraskans\u2019 general contempt for her second novel, ",
      " a thinly veiled allegory published in 1939 about the rise of fascism in the Midwest. Little did I know, of course, that just eight months later, Mr. Hull would, like Sandoz before him, be gone.",
      "\u201cI personally think \u2018Capital City\u2019 was a hate letter to Lincoln,\u201d Mr. Hull said. \u201cBut it was here that she found herself. These people gave her the tools, and I think she felt she owed Lincoln a lot.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s here on the Capitol grounds, where she often spent her summer nights, escaping the heat of her nearby apartment, that I feel most connected to Sandoz. She once wrote that it rose from the corn lands like a \u201csort of modern tall tale,\u201d and for years I understood this as a compliment, as if she could hardly believe its grandeur. There\u2019s no doubt she adored the building. But I wonder now, as the streetlamps blink on and the bats flutter overhead, if I haven\u2019t mistaken her intent. Perhaps by \u201ctall tale,\u201d she meant that the Capitol represented ideals \u2014 equality, justice, democracy \u2014 that the state had not yet realized, or maybe never would. Perhaps the double entendre was intentional. To be progressive in such a conservative state was then \u2014 and is now \u2014 to be perpetually caught between hope and despair.",
      "But while Nebraska is redder now that it\u2019s ever been, Lincoln itself leans relatively liberal and has evolved in some ways that Sandoz probably would have cherished. Forever a champion of the underdog, and the daughter of immigrants herself, Sandoz would very likely praise the city for its ",
      ", for example. As a fan of contemporary art, she would no doubt frequent both the ",
      " and the nearby ",
      ", too.",
      "As an avid walker, she would appreciate the more than 135 miles of hiking and biking trails that now crisscross the city, in addition to the numerous wildlife preserves just beyond it: ",
      ", the ",
      ", ",
      " and more. And of course she would cherish the city\u2019s bookstores, particularly ",
      ", which specializes in Nebraska literature, and ",
      ", Lincoln\u2019s newest, housed in the old ",
      " downtown.",
      "For a more intimate look at the author\u2019s life, I meet up the next afternoon with Jamison Wyatt, a Sandoz aficionado whom I first encountered in college nearly 15 years ago. He now works for the State Legislature and served, until recently, on the executive board of the ",
      ". And since 2014 \u2014 by request only \u2014 he has ushered Sandoz fans like me on a roughly mile-long walking tour of her life in the city. He calls it \u201cStalking the Ghost of Mari Sandoz,\u201d a play on one of her pitched-but-never-published essays about Crazy Horse, and issues a 24-page hand-bound booklet to everyone who attends. Today, that\u2019s just me and my parents, now tourists in their own city. It\u2019s a blistering 99 degrees. Not a cloud in sight.",
      "We start at the corner of 14th and P Streets, in the heart of downtown Lincoln, where Sandoz, then 23, attended Lincoln Business College just months after divorcing her first (and only) husband and fleeing her life as a rural schoolteacher in the Sandhills. We then move north to the welcome shade of campus, with stops at the former Teachers College \u2014 where Sandoz first enrolled \u2014 and the Social Sciences building, where she learned the fundamentals of her craft as a writer.",
      "From there, we head to the former department stores looming above O Street, the city\u2019s main drag, where Sandoz indulged her obsession with hats. Then to the old Lincoln Star building, where she took a part-time job as a copywriter, and past the ",
      ", where \u2014 in its previous iteration \u2014 she savored the coffee shop\u2019s free air-conditioning and wrote multiple drafts of \u201cOld Jules.\u201d",
      "I\u2019ve visited Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s ",
      " in Savannah, Ga.; H.L. Mencken\u2019s ",
      " in Baltimore; William Faulkner\u2019s ",
      " in Oxford, Miss.; the ",
      " in Key West, Fla.; and more. None of those tours were half as compelling as \u201cStalking the Ghost of Mari Sandoz.\u201d Not because her personal landmarks have been especially well preserved \u2014 in fact, most have been razed or renovated beyond recognition, including two of her former apartments \u2014 but because Mr. Wyatt\u2019s fascination with Sandoz is intoxicating.",
      "By the end of our nearly three-hour tour, I feel voyeuristic, as though I\u2019ve witnessed too much, and indeed, Mr. Wyatt\u2019s scholarship bleeds well beyond the pages of Sandoz\u2019s official biography. We know that her husband chased her from the Sandhills all the way to Lincoln, for example, where archival materials suggest he later cried on her doorstep. And we know, unlike most of her peers at U.N.L., that her greatest mentor, ",
      ", wasn\u2019t courting his favorite student, as the campus rag once suggested.",
      "\u201cHe was gay,\u201d says Mr. Wyatt, who explored the professor\u2019s queerness for his undergraduate thesis at U.N.L. In May 1941, Van den Bark was arrested with a younger man from Kansas and charged on scant evidence with \u201cimmorality,\u201d after which the chancellor demanded he resign. Sandoz, forever his friend and confidante, Mr. Wyatt explains, \u201cpretended like she didn\u2019t know where he went. But she knew.\u201d",
      "Mr. Wyatt later guides us through the Capitol\u2019s interior, from the yawning foyer bedecked with glittering murals to the parapet on the 14th floor. \u201cA fine place for thought,\u201d Sandoz once called it, with a sweeping view of the city.",
      "But down here on J Street, just steps from her old apartment, where Sandoz watched the monument rise, year after year, and the moon behind it, night after night, I\u2019m thinking again of her biopic. I\u2019m thinking of \u201cMist and the Tall White Tower,\u201d the short story she wrote not long after the teller\u2019s leap, about a young Sandhiller who flees his abusive caretaker \u2014 not Old Jules but Old Jillery \u2014 only to find himself on the Capitol parapet, one foot dangling over the ledge, struggling to reconcile life\u2019s disappointments, before finally pulling back from the brink. I\u2019d cut to her cluttered desk back home, a cigarette smoldering in the ashtray, and a letter addressed to The Atlantic Monthly sitting beside it.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose anyone will want to print this story,\u201d it reads",
      "\u201cBut you understand that it had to be written.\u201d"

      "Not long into the pandemic, Americans were eager to tip their front-line-working baristas and servers. But now that tip fatigue has set in \u2014 driven by the proliferation of ",
      " that suggest tipping for everything from a sandwich at a grab-and-go counter to an ultrasound \u2014 consumers are often bewildered by when and how much to tip.",
      "\u201cThis is the hottest topic in etiquette right now,\u201d said Daniel Post Senning, the co-author of \u201cEmily Post Etiquette, The Centennial Edition\u201d and the great-great grandson of the etiquette icon ",
      ". He cites the pressure of inflation, the disruption of the pandemic and the rush back to travel for the unease. \u201cThere\u2019s growing anxiety and public discussion around tipping.\u201d",
      "Offering guidance on when and how much to tip when you travel, etiquette experts, academics and travelers weighed in with the following advice.",
      "Tipping standards at restaurants vary widely around the world. In the United States, the American Hotel & Lodging Association suggests in its \u201cGratuity Guide\u201d leaving 15 percent of the total bill or up to 20 percent for extraordinary service.",
      "\u201cThe minimum is 15 percent,\u201d said Elaine Swann, an etiquette expert and the founder of the ",
      " in Carlsbad, Calif. \u201cIt can be increased from there based on the level of service received.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, tip averages in restaurants nationally had crept up to 18 percent, a standard that fell back to 15 percent more recently as inflation grew, according to Amanda Belarmino, an assistant professor in the hospitality school at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cI don\u2019t think consumers want to be stingy, but everybody\u2019s budget is tight and they\u2019re trying to make trade-off decisions,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite expert advice, consumers may not have a choice. In many American cities, tips are increasingly included in the bill and often are well above 15 percent. A recent ",
      " making the rounds in New York argues for a 20 to 25 percent standard.",
      "At a trendy cocktail bar in Los Angeles recently, an $18 drink came to $24 after an 18 percent gratuity and an additional fee for employee health care. The bartender mentioned that the establishment includes tips in their tallies because it serves many guests from foreign countries where tipping is not standard.",
      "According to the ",
      ", service charges benefit all employees, including cooks and dishwashers as well as waiters. \u201cThe service charge model ensures that employee compensation is fair, reliable and not reliant on the diners\u2019 experience or bias,\u201d said Erika Polmar, the executive director of the coalition.",
      "Beyond the United States, tip amounts vary, as illustrated in ",
      " Often, they are less than in the United States and are sometimes included as a service charge (see the section below on tipping abroad).",
      "Some tip requests should be denied, according to experts.",
      "For example, when you\u2019re ordering coffee or a sandwich from a kiosk or counter and are presented with a payment screen including suggested tip amounts, \u201cPush past that awkwardness and push no tip,\u201d Ms. Swann said. \u201cProprietors are offering a perk to employees and they\u2019re putting it on the backs of consumers to absorb.\u201d",
      "Caving in to social pressure or even a scowl from the employee is, in Ms. Swann\u2019s opinion, \u201cgiving in to a level of entitlement that should be nonexistent.\u201d",
      "The growth of credit card payments over cash has made it harder to show a token of appreciation via the tip jar, especially if you\u2019re not carrying cash. If in the past you would pay with cash and leave the coins, Mr. Senning advised rounding up on your credit card and doing the same thing virtually.",
      "Beyond restaurants, travel offers many other opportunities to leave tips for service providers such as cabdrivers, bellhops and valets. Before she takes a trip, Ms. Swann goes to the bank to get cash, especially the $1 and $5 bills that are nearly impossible to withdraw from A.T.M.s.",
      "Most experts agree taxi or rideshare drivers deserve 15 to 20 percent of the fare, depending on the service and the cleanliness of the vehicle. (Ms. Swann once rode in a rideshare car filled with dog hair and made the rare decision not to tip.)",
      "Airport skycaps and the bell people at a hotel should get a few dollars a bag, based on service, and perhaps more if the task is onerous, like handling golf or ski bags. Valet parkers should get $2 to $5 at drop-off and pickup.",
      "And if you only have larger bills, Ms. Swann added, it\u2019s perfectly fine to ask for change back.",
      "Etiquette experts say hotel guests should leave $2 to $5 a night for the housekeeper each morning. The American Hotel & Lodging Association recommends $1 to $5 a night left daily, preferably in a marked envelope making it clear that it is intended for the housekeeper. In its ",
      ", UNITE HERE, the labor union whose members include hotel workers, suggests a minimum of $5 a day and more for suites.",
      "Not many travelers comply.",
      "Despite having the most physically demanding jobs in hotels with few avenues for advancement, \u201chotel housekeepers are some of the least-often tipped employees in the service industry,\u201d according to Dr. Belarmino of U.N.L.V. \u201cUnlike servers, who are often paid less than minimum wage that is then made up by tips, hotel housekeepers\u2019 pay is not contingent upon tips. However, it is a courtesy to tip them.\u201d",
      "But in the age of ",
      " or optional room cleaning, which has become more common since the pandemic, the guidelines get murkier. \u201cIf you stay one night or if you choose to skip housekeeping, I would recommend tipping about $5 at checkout,\u201d Dr. Belarmino said.",
      "If housekeeping is available on demand, most experts recommend tipping each time the room is serviced. And you may want to consider raising the amount.",
      "\u201cIf the hotel won\u2019t do daily housekeeping, make sure to tip extra on the days that you do get service and at checkout, because rooms that have gone days without housekeeping are dirtier and harder for housekeepers to clean,\u201d wrote D. Taylor, the international president of UNITE HERE, in an email.",
      "Customs regarding gratuities vary by country. On some trips abroad, guides with the high-end tour company ",
      " use orientation sessions to advise guests on when to tip in unexpected places \u2014 like bathrooms in Egypt \u2014 and provide travelers with small denominations in the local currency to do so.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a guide to instruct you, make learning the culture of tipping abroad part of your trip planning by consulting guidebooks, tourism board websites and online sources like ",
      ".",
      "\u201cYou have to look at two things: Is it expected and mandatory as it is here in the U.S. for many service jobs? And what is the social safety net like in that place?\u201d said Pauline Frommer, the editorial director of ",
      ", which publishes travel guidebooks covering 48 countries, including advice on how to tip.",
      "In countries like Mexico, where wages are low, she advised tipping in restaurants as you might at home. In Europe, where waiters are paid better, tipping is less important.

      "According to legend, Rome was born on April 21, 753 B.C., when Romulus, the survivor of its feuding twin founders, hitched his plow and furrowed a circular perimeter in the hills above the Tiber River. Everything inside was urbs, city space consecrated by priests who interpreted the will of the gods; everything outside was ager \u2014 unhallowed open territory. \u201cWe have a city founded by the auspices and augury,\u201d the Roman historian Livy wrote. \u201cThere is not a corner of it that is not full of our cults and our gods.\u201d",
      "Rome, in a sense, has been sacred ground right from the start.",
      "To many, Rome is the epicenter of Catholicism, the seat of the Vatican and home to a seemingly infinite number of churches. But in the nearly three millenniums of the city\u2019s recorded past, Christianity is but a chapter. Rome has sheltered polytheistic pagans and monotheistic Jews, adherents of Middle Eastern cults, and, in more recent times, a sizable multinational Muslim community. All have left traces \u2014 altars, temples, shrines, mosques, inscriptions \u2014 some hauntingly beautiful, others erased to stubs.",
      "Rome being Rome, these holy places are often jumbled together or layered \u2014 a church dedicated to the Virgin on top of pagan temples; a medieval church built over an ancient home that had a shrine to the Persian sun god Mithras in its basement.",
      "If you know where to look or what you\u2019re looking at, you\u2019ll find many of these shrines in the historic center, though a few require short treks by train or car. Most pilgrims to the Eternal City declare victory when they reach St. Peter\u2019s Square. But Rome and its environs conceal many holy places beyond the ken of the Bible.",
      "If you think that Roman religion was essentially Greek mythology with Latinized names, think again. Pagan polytheism in ancient Rome was dizzyingly complicated, the gods seen as constant companions who hovered over the city\u2019s mortal residents from birth to death, communicating with them incessantly but obliquely from their temples and shrines.",
      "The best way to get a handle on this divine welter is to take a walking tour. Begin at the summit of the Capitoline, the most sacred of Rome\u2019s seven hills and the center of the ancient city. Duck through an arch on the south side of Michelangelo\u2019s Piazza del Campidoglio and ascend the winding cobblestone alley until it meets ",
      ". You are now standing on the site of ancient Rome\u2019s most important religious monument, the Temple of the Capitoline Triad: Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Juno Regina and Minerva.",
      "Of the immense temple, nothing remains but a single painted roof tile and some tufa foundation blocks dating to the sixth century B.C. (a large chunk is preserved in the ",
      "). But if you turn your back on the tangle of government buildings and tiny parking lots that now cram the summit and gaze through the flickering gray-green olive trees at the Forum below, you may feel the wing of a god brush by.",
      "\u201cThere was a definite hierarchy among the Roman gods,\u201d says Licia Ferro, a classical anthropologist and co-author of \u201cMiti Romani\u201d (\u201cRoman Myths\u201d). \u201cThe major gods lived on high and had their temples in the Roman Forum. But there were also lesser terrestrial deities.\u201d",
      "You get a sense of this hierarchy as you make your way south past the ",
      " (an archaeological site with the foundations of two ancient temples) to the ",
      ", the classical city\u2019s port and cattle market. Here, across from the delicate eighth-century ",
      " stand two perfectly intact Roman temples dedicated to lesser gods \u2014 the toylike, circular Temple of Hercules Victor and the adjoining ",
      ", sacred to the god of keys, doors and livestock. Roman merchants, fervent Hercules worshipers, swore by the divine hero when they consummated business deals by laying a hand on his Ara Maxima \u2014 an immense altar whose podium has been preserved in the crypt of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. The surrounding quarter, anchored by the shaggy marble facades of the ",
      ", is ideal for contemplative strolling. With a good guidebook, you can time-travel through the years.",
      "A short walk along the Tiber and across the Ponte Fabricio footbridge lands you on Tiber Island, sacred to Aesculapius, the god of healing. The elegant Baroque ",
      " stands on the site of the god\u2019s temple, and supposedly the carved cylindrical marble wellhead before the church\u2019s high altar conceals a shaft leading to the temple\u2019s healing fountain. A hospital, the 16th-century Ospedale Fatebenefratelli, carries the island\u2019s healing arts into the present. The site is rendered doubly sacred by the fact that doctors hid Roman Jews here during the Nazi occupation, claiming they carried a contagious (and fictitious) malady called Syndrome K.",
      "Rome\u2019s Jewish community, the oldest in Europe, dates to the second century B.C., and by the imperial period the capital was home to tens of thousands of Jews, most of them packed into brick apartment blocks in the Middle Eastern quarter of Trastevere. \u201cThere were no ghettos in ancient Rome,\u201d says Elsa Laurenzi, a researcher in classical archaeology.",
      "Of the 11 or 12 synagogues that served this vibrant polyglot community, no trace remains. The site in Trastevere identified as the oldest synagogue in Rome \u2014 a humble brick house with a small arched loggia at narrow, cobbled Vicolo dell\u2019Atleta, 14 \u2014 is not classical but medieval. The Tempio Maggiore (Great Synagogue) across the Tiber looks old, but in fact it is a circa 1904 Greco-Babylonian pastiche. (Tours are available through the adjoining ",
      "; to attend Shabbat services, ",
      ".)",
      ", the old port of Rome (an hour by train from the Porta San Paolo station) and now one of the largest and best-preserved archaeological parks in Italy, is the site of an ancient synagogue. The majestic ruin stands alone in a grassy expanse etched with cypress and umbrella pine. Enter the sanctuary between intact columns (look for a relief of a menorah jutting off one of the capitals), walk on the black-and-white mosaic floors, and peer down a marble wellhead that may once have been part of the mikvah. It\u2019s likely you will have the place to yourself.",
      "The catacombs of ",
      " off the Via Appia Antica (a 10-minute cab ride from the Baths of Caracalla) is one of five Jewish catacombs that have been excavated near Rome, and currently the only one open to the public (contact ",
      "). Elsa Laurenzi, who has written about Rome\u2019s Jewish catacombs, notes that Jews did not come to catacombs to pray, considering burial grounds impure. But today, just to stand beside the small tufa niche where a Jewish child was laid to rest 2,000 years ago feels like a kind of prayer. \u201cShe sleeps here in peace \u2014 she was deeply loved,\u201d reads the Greek inscription on a marble plaque etched with Jewish symbols \u2014 a palm branch, a menorah, a shofar.",
      "The Romans, tolerant of foreign faiths, imported two gods that became wildly popular during the imperial period: the Egyptian deity Isis (a divine mother who ushered her dead husband, the fertility god Osiris, into the afterlife) and Mithras, the god of light in Indo-Iranian mythology.",
      "\u201cIsis was a sexy pagan version of the Madonna,\u201d says Enrico Ducrot, an archaeologist who now runs his family\u2019s travel business, Viaggi dell\u2019Elefante. \u201cHer allure is still so fundamental that it hits you at once.\u201d",
      "It has certainly hit him.",
      "Mr. Ducrot grew up not far from the Pantheon, near the site of the ",
      " Rome\u2019s largest temple to Isis. Though the temple has been lost beneath subsequent urban layers, the pink and red granite obelisks and statues plundered from the complex (many of them erected in piazzas around the city and displayed at the Capitoline and Vatican museums) give a sense of its scale and opulence. Recently, a section of the temple\u2019s massive travertine wall and entrance arch was discovered beneath a building owned by Mr. Ducrot. It changed his life. Late next year, he hopes to inaugurate the Iseum, a museum dedicated to the history of the cult.",
      "Isis, apparently, appealed to Rome\u2019s elite, but Mithras was the god of choice for working stiffs and battle-hardened legionnaires (the cult excluded women). Traditional Roman temples were set on high, like the Temple of the Capitoline Triad, and open to the sky through colonnaded porticos or an oculus, but mithraeums were the opposite: underground, cramped, hidden beneath houses, lit only by flickering torches. The idea that the rituals enacted in these holy man caves culminated in the slaughter of a bull is probably a misconception, according to the cultural anthropologist Roberto Libera, director of the ",
      ". More likely, the iconic image of Mithras kneeling on a bull and plunging a dagger into its neck was intended to inspire awe and fervor.",
      "Given the vast number of Mithraic sanctuaries, it is surprisingly difficult to visit one. The Basilica of San Clemente near the Colosseum preserves a mithraeum in its subcellar, but the more interesting sanctuary at the Circus Maximus is only (and rarely) open for group tours. One notable exception requires a 40-minute drive south of Rome into the Alban Hills: The Marino Mithraeum, discovered in 2005, features a stunningly intact wall painting of the bonneted, spangled, pink-tights-clad man-god enacting the bull-stabbing scene. ",
      " is open most weekends.",
      "The Islamic presence in Italy dates to the eighth century, but it wasn\u2019t until 1995 that the officially recognized Great Mosque of Rome opened in Parioli, a neighborhood that\u2019s a short hop by taxi from the ",
      ". The mosque, the largest in Europe, is a gleaming, low-slung modern structure that artfully bridges East and West. A fountain near the entrance refreshes a plaza whose pavement echoes the dazzling geometry of Michelangelo\u2019s Campidoglio, and the rows of twinned pillars leading to the travertine-clad sanctuary recall Bernini\u2019s monumental colonnade at St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "The interior is a study in curving lines, with low-hanging circular chandeliers ringing the central dome, intricately tiled walls and a rich Persian carpet swirling across the floor. You enter to the sound of bird song, you pray in a luminous rotunda, and you emerge from the compound into a pine and cypress grove at the edge of upscale Parioli. Except when a train rumbles by, it is a lush, hushed precinct.",
      "Maybe too hushed. Rome\u2019s fast-growing Islamic community, many of them immigrants from Morocco, Bangladesh, Albania or Senegal, resides on the other side of town in gritty, bustling piazzas near the Termini rail station. For most Roman Muslims, attending Friday services in the Great Mosque would require taking a day off from work.",
      "\u201cThe Great Mosque is a showpiece, a symbol, a place of pride,\u201d notes Imam Yahya Pallavicini, president of COREIS (the Italian Islamic Religious Community). \u201cBut the city\u2019s Muslim residents are more likely to pray at smaller unofficial neighborhood mosques, often located in private homes or garages.\u201d On a typical Friday at the Great Mosque, hundreds gather in a space built for thousands.",
      "The difficulty that contemporary Muslims have in finding state-sanctioned Roman houses of worship brings to mind the plight of Rome\u2019s first Christians. Unlike Jews and adherents of Mithras and Isis, Christians were violently persecuted \u2014 and some of Rome\u2019s earliest churches, including St. Peter\u2019s, are martyriums: sites where saints were slain for their beliefs. The churches of Santa Sabina, Santa Prassede, Santa Pudenziana and Sant\u2019Agnese Fuori le Mura were also sanctified by suffering. With their crystalline mosaics and thin, pure light, these humbly elegant basilicas conjure the time when a strange, fervent, unyielding new cult rose from the ashes of empire.",
      "Every age, every faith, every pilgrim makes Rome sacred anew.",
      "David Laskin, a frequent visitor to Rome, is the author of many books, including \u201cThe Family,\u201d a family history, and the novel \u201cWhat Sammy Knew.\u201d"

      "On a recent Monday afternoon at York University in Toronto, Dr. Christina Sharpe was waiting for her students to arrive. Campus felt sleepy, blanketed in snow from a recent storm. They trickled in, arranging themselves around the classroom. That week they were discussing ",
      " No one in attendance had read the book before.",
      "Sharpe pulled out her copy, which she has had for more than 30 years and keeps carefully sheathed in protective plastic. Sharpe, who is 57, sat poised in a black tunic over black pants and boots, her red lips immaculate. She smoothed a hand over the well-worn cover. The book was fat with stickie notes and tabs, its pages so marked up with highlights, exclamations, notes and annotations that it resembled a devotional.",
      "Historically, narratives about slavery prioritized white readers, displaying atrocities to rouse support for abolition. Morrison\u2019s fifth novel, in contrast, focuses on the interiority of the enslaved and formerly enslaved, placing the textures of their lives at the center of the story. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this book for a long time,\u201d Sharpe told the class. It \u201ccompletely rewired how one could write and think about slavery.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeloved,\u201d at its core, is a story of multiple hauntings: The remnants of trauma left in those forced to be property, the fury of a petulant baby-spirit that seems to come back from the dead to find the mother who killed her rather than let her be taken into enslavement. The book holds horrors, but it also raises questions about the beginning of freedom time. \u201cFreeing yourself was one thing,\u201d Morrison writes, \u201cbut claiming ownership of that freed self was another.\u201d The work of embodiment, belonging and rest become the central themes for the characters and, by extension, the readers. For Sharpe, \u201cBeloved\u201d is rich in techniques for refusing the logic of slavery. One of those is infanticide; another, Sharpe shared with the class, is love.",
      "She held the book aloft and read the title aloud: \u201cBeloved.\u201d She paused and reframed the word for us. \u201cBe loved.\u201d The name of the book, Sharpe told the class, is \u201can injunction, a command, a wish, a plea, a lamentation.\u201d To love the self, to believe the self worthy of love and to let that love radiate out and fill up others around you.",
      "A thick silence settled over the classroom as the students absorbed the force of the revelation. The first and final words of the book were not merely an epitaph on a grave: They were instructions for living. Be loved. What I was witnessing, I later realized, was more than a lecture. It was a portal into Sharpe\u2019s methodology. \u201cI think with \u2018Beloved\u2019 almost every day,\u201d she later told me.",
      "Like Morrison, Sharpe \u2014 who is a professor of English literature and Black studies \u2014 is intent on showing how language is like a knife: a tool or weapon depending on who is wielding it. She also understands the way terms like \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201canti-Blackness\u201d run the risk of losing their potency as they become more familiar and commonplace. Sharpe refuses the devaluation of these words and resuscitates them with her critical analysis and poetic reflections.",
      "The book Sharpe is best known for, ",
      " landed in the fall of 2016, just as the final delusions of a post-racial America were disintegrating amid the rise of white nationalism. The book begins with a stark declaration: Black death is foundational \u2014 even necessary \u2014 to American democracy. Death, literally, but also spiritually, culturally, socially. Sharpe is not the first academic, poet or artist to assert that the negation of Black humanity that began with the Middle Passage is still animating American life, but she offered a new metaphorical framework for understanding how.",
      "\u201cIn the Wake\u201d roiled the academic world. It appeared during a \u201craging and at times venomous debate between Black optimism and Black pessimism,\u201d says Saidiya Hartman, author of \u201cWayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments,\u201d who met Sharpe nearly a decade ago at a conference and has become a close friend. \u201cChristina\u2019s work totally unsettles that binary. She addresses the structural conditions of anti-Blackness that condemn Black people on a variety of levels and still attends to the richness of Black social living, and it is an essential contribution.\u201d Sharpe is part of a cohort of thinkers and artists \u2014 including Hartman, Arthur Jafa, Fred Moten, Simone Leigh, Garrett Bradley, Ja\u2019Tovia Gary, Lorraine O\u2019Grady and others \u2014 who are interrogating the rendering of Blackness in American culture and offering new ways of looking, seeing and being seen.",
      " Sharpe lays out an exploded view of the word \u201cwake.\u201d One definition is the disturbance a boat leaves behind as it moves through water. What would it mean to understand all of American life as still caught in the wake, still caught in the undertow of the ships that carried the enslaved? Sharpe also put forth the metaphors of the ship (the processes by which Black people are still seen as property), the hold (the ways that captivity and punishment are still central to Black life) and the weather (the ambient anti-Blackness that is as pervasive as climate).",
      "The word wake invokes the funereal, yet Sharpe also summons the celebratory nature of a wake, the ways Black people find \u201can insistence on existence\u201d through family, music, dance, community and art. This she calls \u201cwake work.\u201d Her aim is not to suffuse people with a sense of despair, she told me, but to galvanize them to \u201cturn our attention elsewhere.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t mourn and don\u2019t grieve,\u201d she told me, but rather to stop expecting redemption, validation and justice from white society and institutions.",
      "Sharpe never directly mentions the word \u201cwoke,\u201d an idiom that has been used as far back as the 1930s to mean readiness and watchfulness. In recent years, the word has been weaponized as a rallying cry against progressive ideas and policies. Its inevitable perversion is implied in the book\u2019s central premise. Woke is caught in the wake too, its fate a warning about just how powerful the churn behind those ships can be.",
      "Sharpe\u2019s latest book, ",
      " which was published in April, is her most liberating and poetic experiment yet. Made up of 248 individual notes, it is a deft blend of memoir, theory, archival documents and lyrical reflections on her daily life. It also includes Sharpe\u2019s photographs of moody skyscapes, images of flowers, family photographs, art installations and paintings.",
      "There is wonder (Note 133, marveling at a rare photograph of her mother and grandmother, leaning sweetly against each other, her mother\u2019s hands gracefully cupped, Sharpe asks, \u201cWhere did she learn that?\u201d); personal history (Note 195, on a nervous tic developed in graduate school of strangling herself when she spoke: \u201cSpeech and speechlessness; each one has a cost\u201d); cultural criticism (Note 27, after visiting the Legacy Museum in Alabama, which features a photo wall showcasing historical images of white violence: \u201cHow many more lookings?\u201d); meditations on archival work (Note 185, on collective memory: \u201cWe have to function as a living library; as an institution\u201d).",
      "The notes build in momentum and assemble themselves into a mosaic that holds the relentless terror of Black life as well as its undeniable beauty. \u201cI wanted them to have a certain kind of force and velocity and accumulation,\u201d she told me. By turning her gaze inward, Sharpe offers a framework for understanding how to move forward, even when burdened by all the knowledge of the world\u2019s cruelty. (Note 106: \u201cYou do not have to save the things that kill you.\u201d)",
      " class, Sharpe welcomed me into her home. It felt sturdy, like a farmhouse. A mantel held candles, flowers and artwork by a friend, the abstract painter ",
      ", who Sharpe says renders Blackness with \u201cbreath and air.\u201d She set out a lime green tray of fresh figs, bright orange clementines, crispy grapes and a fragrant tea served in delicate floral cups. The mantel and dining table were covered with fresh flowers: red tulips and scalloped pink ranunculus the size of baby cabbages. At the edge of my view, the tips of deciduous trees were patiently waiting out winter.",
      "Sharpe has lived in Toronto for the last five years, drawn in part by her partner, the poet ",
      ", who has lived there since she was 17. Brand was in Tobago for the winter, and Sharpe and I arranged ourselves around a coffee table covered in books by photographers and scholars working in the African diaspora, including ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      ". Her voice is soft and girlish except when she breaks into a full-throated laugh that takes over her whole body, her careful regality surrendering momentarily to spontaneous delight.",
      "Sharpe told me that the idea of \u201cOrdinary Notes\u201d came from a scene in \u201cBeloved\u201d depicting a character who tries to escape enslavement only to end up in a Georgia prison. Each morning and evening, another incarcerated man calls out a clear, high note signaling the start and end of their day. He is called Hi Man. Hi Man\u2019s offering are the notes of humanity amid grisly conditions of bone-breaking labor and sexual assault. To Sharpe, this \u201csounding of care\u201d is an offering of generosity and presence despite untenable circumstances, and it is enough to sustain the men until their eventual escape. Her book is a prismatic examination of all the notes in her own life \u2014 the ones that sound care and the ones that don\u2019t \u2014 and how knowing the difference offers a kind of sanity.",
      "\u201cHow to find the words and grammars we can live in?\u201d she asked, and paused. \u201cBecause we do live in them. How to keep working in the knowledge that we do make them and we do live in them?\u201d",
      "Sharpe gave me a tour of the artwork in her home, much of which is the byproduct of a collaboration. She is an art critic and has contributed to the monographs of some of the most important artists of our time, including ",
      " ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      ", ",
      " and ",
      ". There was a drawing by Saar and a painting by ",
      ". A framed print called \u201cVanishing Act,\u201d by the artist ",
      ", caught my eye. In her first book, \u201cMonstrous Intimacies,\u201d Sharpe writes extensively on Walker\u2019s work to reveal how society is programmed to default to racist narratives. Sharpe and Walker are connected through their mutual desire to understand the \u201cdisfiguration of blackness and whiteness\u201d and the consequences of denying our shared complicity in the way the past still shapes the present.",
      "In Walker\u2019s print, a woman kneels before a rapt audience, devouring a small child. The title refers to a sleight of hand, a trick performed by a magician, but the vanishing in this image involves cannibalism. The setting \u2014 a stage \u2014 and their dated clothing \u2014 petticoats and stockings \u2014 recall minstrelsy. The hands of both figures, even the person being eaten, are relaxed, complicating the relationship between exploiter and exploited. The work in Sharpe\u2019s office, like many of Walker\u2019s famous prints and sculptures, is devoid of color. One could make assumptions about the figures and their respective races, but the only clues are drawn from historical characterizations of Black people (the older woman is wearing a head scarf). Over the last two decades, Walker has been attacked by critics for reproducing racist tropes, but that outrage is misdirected. It is the presuppositions that viewers bring to the work that are so repellent, not the figures themselves. In \u201cVanishing Act,\u201d it is impossible to tell who is the victor and who is the victim. Only their acceptance of what they\u2019re doing, and perhaps the pleasure they\u2019re taking in doing it, is truly legible.",
      "The more time I spend with Sharpe\u2019s work, the more it inflects my ways of seeing the world. According to Sharpe, Blackness is anagrammatical, meaning that the structures that order language, thought and society become disordered \u2014 if not destroyed entirely \u2014 when they encounter Blackness. \u201cHer work has shown that we, as Black people, are the foils of humanity,\u201d Frank B. Wilderson III, author of \u201cAfropessimism,\u201d told me. \u201cIf humanity defines itself against us, what does it mean for us to live every day as the anti-human?\u201d",
      "In my daily life, I\u2019ve been interrogating headlines, interactions, film, TV and visual art with a radar attuned to the frequency of Sharpe. The Kansas City Police not immediately taking Andrew Lester into custody after he ",

      " and Black models for free labor \u2014 the ship, the hold and the wake.",
      " Sharpe\u2019s parents, Ida Wright Sharpe and Van Buren Sharpe Jr., moved from West Philadelphia to Wayne, Pa. \u201cThey wanted what they both imagined and knew that they did not have,\u201d she writes. A home big enough for the family that would eventually grow to six children, a yard, access to good schools and proverbial opportunities. Her mother worked in a department store and her father was a mail sorter and chef. Sharpe was born in 1965. Her eldest sibling was almost 22 years her senior, and by the time her sibling who was closest in age went to college, she was 11. It was lonely. \u201cI mostly felt like an only child,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Ida, doted on her and gifted her \u201ca love of words,\u201d inscribing books to her daughter in her ornate script. Ida also gave her the gift of time to get lost in them. Sharpe read \u201cThe People Could Fly,\u201d \u201cSong of Solomon\u201d and \u201cLittle Women\u201d for hours, curled up in a roomy windowsill in the house. In the spring, she collected wild violets for her mother who used them to make jelly. In lieu of trips to the ballet or theater, Ida hosted Sunday salons where she served poundcake and tea, and mother and daughter read poetry to each other.",
      "An idea that reverberates in all of Sharpe\u2019s work is that you might be forced to live in subjugation but that does not mean only living life as a subjugated person. \u201cThat is what I always want to animate,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny the violence. But that\u2019s not the only way we encounter each other.\u201d Beauty, pleasure and the \u201cspace to dream\u201d (Note 51) were forces applied steadily to a young Sharpe, counteracting all that threatened to destabilize her self-worth. \u201cI marvel at my mother\u2019s commitment to joy,\u201d she told me. That joy made Sharpe possible. The final note in Ordinary Notes reads, \u201cThis is a love letter to my mother.\u201d",
      "But what happened inside the Sharpe home was one thing. What happened outside it was another. \u201cThings were not better in this \u2018new world,\u2019\u201d she writes. In person, she tells me that her experiences as a young girl in Wayne were \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "In \u201cOrdinary Notes,\u201d Sharpe recalls photographs of white terror \u2014 people screaming from the sidelines of a school and neighborhood integration, the Charlottesville tiki torches in 2017. They dredge up something dormant for her. \u201cHis face is an open-mouthed rictus of hatred,\u201d she writes in Note 5. \u201cI felt I knew it.\u201d The next note includes a heartbreakingly tender photograph of Sharpe as a little girl, hair in plaits, smile broad and unbroken, for the moment.",
      "\u201cIt was not a happy time,\u201d she said, falling silent.",
      "When she was almost 12, her father died. Money became scarce. Bills went unpaid, winters were spent without heat, repairs to the house went undone. Throughout, her mother cultivated beauty. Forsythia, cut from the yard, arranged in a vase, served as a welcome distraction from a ceiling that was falling down. Mustard greens, corn and tomatoes from the garden supplemented meals, and beautifully rolled logs made from paper were burned for heat. During Sharpe\u2019s first semester as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, her mother was unable to make a payment, and the school threatened to kick her out. That experience indelibly shaped her, but so did the teachers, many of them Black, she met during that time.",
      "Sharpe enrolled in the English Ph.D. program at Cornell University \u2014 \u201cso I\u2019d have the most time and space to think and learn\u201d \u2014 and planned to start an independent Black middle school in West Philadelphia. In our conversation, she declined to revisit her time at the university in detail, but she re-enacted a ",
      ", who asked her about her decision to leave the United States in 1972. Simone, in pearls and gold eye shadow, answers before he can finish the question. \u201cRACISM,\u201d she announces, her contralto voice almost belting out the word to eject it more forcefully from her body. Sharpe\u2019s impression is uncanny. \u201cThey were a trip,\u201d she told me.",
      "In academia at that time, personal experience and knowledge were viewed as inauthentic forms of scholarship, and those who tried to incorporate these elements into their work were deterred. It was disparagingly called \u201cmesearch.\u201d \u201cI was trained as an academic; you don\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite everything we know about objectivity, we were not encouraged to include ourselves in particular ways.\u201d Still, she left her mark by advocating for more diverse teachers, pressing the university to bring in more Chicana, Asian and Native professors, which they did.",
      " of academia took a toll on her confidence, keeping her stagnant longer than she imagined possible. \u201cThere\u2019s criticism that is meant to help you and there is criticism that is meant to stop you,\u201d she told me, with a leveling look. During this time, her mother died. She fell into a deep depression. (Note 156: \u201cIt was as if I\u2019d lost my center of gravity.\u201d) She lay in bed so long she developed a sore. Once again, her mother intervened. She had given young Christina a book on North American birds, and turning her gaze skyward had become a passion. She returned to the hobby while mourning; looking up was a way out.",
      "In 1998, she was hired at Tufts University, later becoming the first Black woman to get tenure in the English department and the only one during her time there to be promoted to a full professorship. It took nearly 20 years.",
      "invitation for a conference called Loophole of Retreat, scheduled for early October in Venice alongside the Biennale, began circulating online. The sculptor Simone Leigh, who represented the United States at the art fair, hosted the convening as part of her presentation (it was organized by the curator Rashida Bumbray), and Sharpe was among the more than 60 scholars and thinkers enlisted to share their work.",
      "Leigh, like Sharpe, is invested in the project of wresting back control of Black imagery from its historic (and continued) abuse without reproducing past terrors and trauma. The towering scale of her magisterial sculptures commands an indisputable authority rarely afforded to Black women. They \u2014 and she \u2014 author their own narratives; they validate their own importance.",
      "The conference took its name from a phrase that the writer Harriet Jacobs used in \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\u201d to describe the seven years she spent hiding in a crawl space that was so cramped it left her permanently disabled. Yet she still claimed the tiny attic as a site of independence, a place to dream and plot strategies for freedom until she could enact them. Italy is a complicated place to undertake practices of freedom, in part because of the routine deaths of African migrants who drown seeking refuge in the country. Participants in the conference invoked the connection between Jacobs\u2019s confinement and the modern-day horrors experienced regularly.",
      "One of the conference\u2019s themes was maroonage, referring to people who escaped slavery to build their own independent communities on the outskirts of society. For those three days, the tiny lush island off the coast of Venice where the convening took place became its own planet, accruing a powerful density anchored by hundreds of Black people, mostly women, who flew from all corners of the world to participate. Scholarly presentations lived alongside films about utopian Detroit and about Drexciya, a mythological aqueous society, and emotional readings about Black motherhood. The convening suggested that the potential for Black sovereignty was more than just an idea; it had already arrived.",
      "On the first day, Sharpe took the stage to read excerpts from \u201cOrdinary Notes\u201d inside a large, ornate hall, dressed in a blue striped tunic layered over a multicolored turtleneck. It was the first time many in attendance were getting a preview of the successor to \u201cIn the Wake,\u201d and the room crackled with anticipation.",
      "She read a series of notes about a photograph of her mother and a moving encounter with a man she witnessed kneeling on the ground on an earlier trip to Venice. Sharpe closed her reading with Note 175: \u201cTenderness might just be a gesture, it might just be a look, a Black look, some regard, relayed between people in peril.\u201d",
      "Care, as practiced by Sharpe, means small gestures that acknowledge one another\u2019s humanity. It means cultivating an awareness of the possibility of re-enacting violence even while trying to critique it. The time in Venice felt imbued with such care. It was a pause from the abjection that many of its attendees experience on a regular basis; a temporary space to practice methods of consideration, decadence and stillness. On those grounds, in this collection of moments, Sharpe\u2019s theories sharpened into focus. Freedom and love will never come from white society: They must be obtained by the self and also exchanged freely among ourselves.",
      "One note that has most stuck with me, Note 96, describes an interaction between Sharpe and a young woman who works in the cafe in the Tate Modern in London. Sharpe pauses to say hello. The greeting doesn\u2019t register. Sharpe tries again. Finally, the woman draws herself into the moment. She tells Sharpe that she has been working at the museum for months and no one had ever spoken to her beyond asking her to do something. She thanks her for \u201cseeing me and asking about me.\u201d Sharpe records the reminder of their interaction as follows:",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018I see you.\u2019",
      "She says, \u2018I know.\u2019",
      "I say, \u2018We see each other.\u2019",
      "She says, \u2018Yes. We do.\u2019\u201d",
      "(Note 181: \u201cRegard is a habit of care. It is appreciation and esteem. It is the right of repair.\u201d )",
      "If there\u2019s an argument at the center of \u201cOrdinary Notes,\u201d it is that attentiveness and imagination are powerful restorative agents capable of reconstituting what has been broken down and targeted for obliteration. I often think back to that time in Venice, suspended in motion, embodying survival and sustenance. I felt carried along by a great momentum, perhaps on another kind of vessel, powering us toward the beyond.",
      "Mickalene Thomas is an artist known for her paintings of African American women that combine historical, political and pop culture references. She uses photography often to examine complex notions of femininity while challenging common definitions of beauty and aesthetic representations of women in recontextualized interior settings."

No doubt this was unfair to Thomas and to Jane. But you\u2019ll understand what brought it to mind: Neither you nor your wife are models of how spouses should behave. Each has betrayed the other\u2019s trust.",

      "What your wife has been saying goes beyond exasperated venting. The specific way she has been bad-mouthing you, in fact, strikes at the core of a marital relationship; she\u2019s impugning your character, your worth as a person and the value of her marriage. Some very toxic air needs to be cleared. Apologize for your wrongdoing, and ask her whether she wants to remain with the deadbeat she described in those texts. If you don\u2019t bring up the idea of a separation, she may well beat you to it.",

      "When the former secretary of state and C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo, a man who had dealt firsthand with autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, described Randi Weingarten as \u201cthe most dangerous person in the world\u201d last November, it seemed as though he couldn\u2019t possibly be serious.",
      "Weingarten is 65 and just over five feet tall. She is Jewish and openly gay \u2014 she\u2019s married to a rabbi \u2014 and lives in Upper Manhattan. She is the longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, which is not even the country\u2019s biggest union of public-school educators. (The A.F.T. has 1.7 million members; the National Education Association has three million.) The A.F.T. did give in excess of $26 million to Democratic candidates and causes in the 2022 election cycle, but the Carpenters and Joiners union gave more than twice as much.",
      "Pompeo, whose remarks appeared in a widely quoted interview with the online news site Semafor, had nevertheless put his finger on something: The pandemic and the ongoing culture wars over race and gender had shifted America\u2019s educational landscape, and with it the political landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s not a close call,\u201d ",
      " \u201cIf you ask, \u2018Who\u2019s the most likely to take this republic down?\u2019 It would be the teachers\u2019 unions, and the filth that they\u2019re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don\u2019t know math and reading or writing.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans quickly piled on. Pompeo had set the bar high, and they needed to invoke equally hot rhetoric and florid imagery to ensure headlines of their own. \u201cBig labor unions have taken over public education,\u201d Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina told Fox News in late January. \u201cThat\u2019s bad for parents, bad for kids, bad for America.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida mounted his attack in The American Conservative magazine: \u201cOur schools are a cesspool of Marxist indoctrination. Dangerous academic constructs like critical race theory and radical gender theory are being forced on elementary school children.\u201d Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had already garnered national attention with his book bans, Florida\u2019s \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d and its so-called Don\u2019t Say Gay legislation, unveiled a new proposal designed to rein in \u201coverreaching teachers\u2019 unions,\u201d which a column on the Fox website enthusiastically embraced as \u201ca blueprint to dominate union bosses.\u201d ",
      " \u201chave been taken over by the radical left maniacs\u201d and \u201cpink-haired communists,\u201d released his own plan to Save American Education. It was clear that Weingarten had come to stand for something much larger than herself.",
      "The last few years have been historically convulsive ones for education in America. Some 1.3 million children left the public schools during the pandemic. The results from the most recent ",
      " \u2014 known as the nation\u2019s report card \u2014 revealed the largest average score decline in reading since 1990 and the first average score decline in math since 1969. Schools have reported major increases in rates of student depression, anxiety and trauma. School districts around the country are experiencing severe teacher shortages. Last fall, a Gallup poll found that the percentage of ",
      " to 42 percent, a 20-year low.",
      "This crisis has political consequences. The pandemic closures and classroom culture wars have fueled the revival of the dormant school-choice movement, with Republican-led states around the country passing an array of far-reaching ",
      ". These bills come in different forms but share a common goal: to enable parents to move their children out of America\u2019s government-run education system en masse. All of the prospective Republican presidential candidates for 2024 have committed to building on this growing movement, whose roots can be traced back more than 50 years, to the battle over desegregation. The same pandemic closures that demonstrated how central public schools are to the communities they serve also became the inciting event for an unprecedented effort to dismantle them.",
      "The public-education system may not be very popular right now, but both Democrats and Republicans tend to like their local schools and their children\u2019s teachers. The unions that represent those teachers, however, are more polarizing. One reason for this is that they are actively involved in partisan politics, and, more specifically, are closely aligned with the Democrats, a reality powerfully driven home during the pandemic. A study by Brown University\u2019s Annenberg Institute found that Democratic districts, with correspondingly ",
      " more slowly and gradually than Republican districts with weaker unions. In some ways, Randi Weingarten and the A.F.T. \u2014 the union \u201cboss\u201d and \u201cbig labor\u201d \u2014 are a logical, even inevitable target for the G.O.P.",
      "A frequent knock on the A.F.T. is that it puts teachers before students, a framing neatly encapsulated by a quote attributed to the union\u2019s former president Al Shanker: \u201cWhen schoolchildren start paying union dues, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll start representing the interests of schoolchildren.\u201d Shanker\u2019s biographer, Richard Kahlenberg, found no record of Shanker\u2019s ever saying this and doesn\u2019t think he ever did, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the union\u2019s critics from citing it. Weingarten has a rebuttal: Good working conditions for teachers make good learning conditions for students. But Weingarten does in fact represent teachers, not students. Often, such as when it comes to issues like classroom size or school budgets, their interests align. Sometimes they don\u2019t. ",
      "For a period during the pandemic, the two groups\u2019 apparent interests diverged, and a series of fault lines started opening across the country, separating not only Republicans from Democrats but also parents from teachers, centrist Democrats from progressives and urban Black parents from suburban white parents, and even dividing the teachers\u2019 union itself. These fault lines widened as the reopening debates merged into fights over how schools should deal with the teaching of the country\u2019s racial history as well as sexuality and gender identity.",
      "What became increasingly clear to me over the last several months, as I spoke to dozens of politicians, political consultants, union leaders, parent activists and education scholars about the convulsions in American education, is that it\u2019s no longer possible to separate education from politics, and that public schools are more vulnerable than they\u2019ve ever been. How did Randi Weingarten wind up at the center of the 2024 Republican primary? The only way to answer that question is to re-examine America\u2019s education wars and the competing political agendas that are driving them. \u201cOh, goodness, no! Not at all!\u201d Pompeo answered when I asked if he was, perhaps, being hyperbolic in his remarks about Weingarten. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Ms. Weingarten, but she has been the most visible face of the destruction of American education.\u201d",
      "early months of the pandemic, teachers were celebrated as essential workers, heroically continuing to serve America\u2019s children from their homes, often with limited resources and inadequate technology. But during the summer of 2020, things started to shift. There was already early research showing that students were suffering academically from remote learning. Schools across Europe had begun reopening without any major outbreaks, and many of America\u2019s private and parochial schools were making plans to resume in-person learning at the start of the new school year. A lot of public-school parents wanted their children to be back in the classroom, too. But many teachers seemed resistant to the idea.",
      "Because of the decentralized structure of America\u2019s public-education system, which has some 14,000 different school districts, the federal government could not order schools to reopen for in-person learning, but in July 2020, President ",
      " from those that didn\u2019t. His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, echoed his sentiments, demanding that the nation\u2019s schools be \u201cfully operational\u201d by the fall without providing a specific plan for doing so.",
      "Many members of the A.F.T. remained worried about putting themselves, their families and their communities at risk. The A.F.T. had issued its ",
      " in late April, calling for adequate personal protective equipment, a temporary suspension of formal teacher performance evaluations, a limit on student testing, a cancellation of student-loan debt and a $750 billion federal aid package to help schools prepare to reopen safely and facilitate \u201ca real recovery for all our communities.\u201d Weingarten did not believe the Trump administration was giving schools what teachers needed to return to work safely. She publicly denounced Trump and DeVos\u2019s call to reopen as \u201creckless,\u201d \u201ccallous\u201d and \u201ccruel,\u201d and the A.F.T. passed a resolution supporting local strikes if schools were forced to reopen in areas where a variety of safety conditions hadn\u2019t been met. As if to underscore the point, some ",
      "Florida became a test case. Even as the state\u2019s Covid death rate was surging in July, its Department of Education issued an emergency order requiring schools to fully reopen in August. The state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, the Florida Education Association, affiliated with both the A.F.T. and the N.E.A., sued DeSantis and his education commissioner, Richard Corcoran, among others, to block the reopenings, arguing that the order violated the state\u2019s Constitution, which guarantees Florida residents the right to \u201csafe\u201d and \u201csecure\u201d public schools. At a virtual news conference announcing the lawsuit, Weingarten accused DeSantis of being in \u201cintense denial.\u201d After some Florida schools started reopening, an A.F.T. political action committee produced a ",
      " citing claims that schools were becoming superspreader sites and that children were being used as \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d ",
      "As the lawsuit was working its way through the legal system \u2014 the union won in the lower court but lost on appeal \u2014 Florida was holding its biannual school-board elections, and the prospective return to in-person learning became the defining issue in many races. In Brevard County, Tina Descovich, the incumbent, was in favor of an immediate return to the classroom and opposed mask mandates. She was challenged by a public-school speech-language pathologist, Jennifer Jenkins, who called for a more cautious approach, including a mask mandate for all but the youngest children. ",
      "Jenkins easily won the late-August election, but Descovich was just getting started. She called Tiffany Justice, a fellow school-board member in nearby Indian River County, to suggest that they create their own parents\u2019 rights group, Moms for Liberty. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something here,\u201d Justice recalled Descovich\u2019s telling her. \u201cWe have to help these parents because they\u2019re trying to step up and speak out, and the schools are just slamming them at every turn.\u201d",
      "Other parents across the political spectrum started organizing, too. Many public schools hadn\u2019t fully reopened for the start of the new school year, and they were frustrated. They wrote op-eds, held rallies or met via Zoom with school-board members and other elected officials, often finding themselves at odds with local teachers\u2019 unions and union-backed school-board members. The first fault lines had started to open.",
      "the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement had prompted a national reckoning over race, as well as an ensuing backlash. The politics of the pandemic had begun to merge with the culture wars, and both were playing out most vividly in the American classroom. An esoteric academic term \u2014 critical race theory, or C.R.T. \u2014 had improbably become the rallying cry for a conservative campaign focused on the teaching of the nation\u2019s racial history. President Trump, running for re-election, eagerly took up the cause, blaming \u201cdecades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools\u201d for the Black Lives Matter protests and urging America\u2019s parents to fight back against efforts to teach their children \u201chateful lies about this country.\u201d",
      "The ",
      " committing publicly to the fight to end \u201csystemic racism in America.\u201d Some of the A.F.T.\u2019s locals went further. The Chicago Teachers Union took to the streets to demand that the city\u2019s board of education cancel a $33 million contract between Chicago\u2019s public schools and its Police Department for the safety officers who staff the city\u2019s public schools. United Teachers Los Angeles helped lead a successful fight to press its school district to slash its police budget by $25 million and use the money instead to hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers.",
      "That October, Weingarten embarked on a cross-country bus tour to get out the vote for Joe Biden. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, had not always been in sync with the A.F.T.; the union opposed elements of Obama\u2019s Race to the Top program, which sent money to states that reformed their public-education systems by, among other things, weakening teacher tenure, introducing data-driven accountability measures and adding more nonunionized charter schools. Biden, by contrast, vowed to focus on neighborhood public schools rather than charters and criticized the standardized-testing regimes and teacher evaluations that were a hallmark of Race to the Top. Weingarten\u2019s name was even floated as a candidate for secretary of education. She didn\u2019t get the job, but she and the head of the N.E.A., Becky Pringle, were invited to the White House on the day after Biden\u2019s inauguration. The teachers\u2019 unions finally had a true ally in the Oval Office. The first lady, Jill Biden, taught at a public community college herself. (",
      " President Biden would later quip.) The new administration gave teachers preferential access to the Covid vaccine, behind some other essential workers but ahead of the general population. Biden had pledged to quickly reopen America\u2019s schools, and the A.F.T. was communicating with top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about its guidelines for doing so, suggesting that the agency add a provision allowing for its recommendations to be revisited if a highly contagious Covid variant emerged. But the anger that had been unleashed by the pandemic closures and the culture wars had not abated.",
      "Justice and Descovich, the former Florida school-board members, incorporated Moms for Liberty in early 2021 with a far more ambitious and political agenda than simply advocating a return to maskless, in-person classes. As the group\u2019s mission statement explained, it was \u201cdedicated to fighting for the survival of America by unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.\u201d The group built its brand with bumper magnets and T-shirts emblazoned with the motto \u201cWe Do NOT Co-Parent With the Government.\u201d It was embraced by the right-wing media and then by donors eager to turn it into a national movement, while nurturing its grass-roots image, mirroring the model created by the Tea Party, the quasi-populist uprising fueled by conservative billionaires and Fox News. The former Fox host Megyn Kelly headlined a fund-raising event in Florida, speaking about, as Justice recalled, \u201cthe woke ideology\u201d coming out of America\u2019s classrooms. Moms for Liberty soon expanded beyond Florida. That summer, a chapter in Tennessee presented an 11-page ",
      " objecting to a curriculum that it said \u201cfocuses repeatedly and daily on very dark and divisive slivers of American history\u201d and works to \u201csow feelings of resentment, shame of one\u2019s skin color and/or fear.\u201d After several Republican states passed laws limiting the teaching of race-related subjects and banning C.R.T., Weingarten gave a speech citing a historian who had compared their efforts to the censorship of the Soviet regime. A clip of the speech spent days in heavy rotation on Fox News, and it inspired an editorial in The Wall Street Journal: ",
      " Youngkin\u2019s plan to turn Virginia\u2019s 2021 governor\u2019s race into a referendum on America\u2019s battles over education. Initially, he was just hoping to prevent his opponent, Terry McAuliffe, from owning an issue that historically favored Democrats. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to let them take the fight to us,\u201d Jeff Roe, one of Youngkin\u2019s chief strategists, told me.",
      "By almost every measure, Youngkin, a former private-equity executive with no political experience, was the underdog. McAuliffe, a Democratic stalwart dating back to the Clinton presidency, served as Virginia\u2019s governor between 2014 and 2018. (A state law barring governors from serving consecutive terms prevented him from running for re-election.)",
      "Biden had beaten Trump by 10 points in Virginia, and McAuliffe led in the early polls. But Virginia\u2019s schools had been among the last on the East Coast to fully reopen, and the lingering bitterness from these pandemic closures had formed a politically combustible mix with the rising culture wars. Amid the national racial reckoning of 2020, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County \u2014 one of the top public high schools in the nation \u2014 had jettisoned its admissions exam, prompting a lawsuit by 17 families, many of them Asian American, who viewed the change as a form of discrimination against their children.",
      "Some of the most bitter fights were unfolding in suburban Loudoun County, where a proposal to allow transgender children to choose which bathrooms and pronouns they wished to use had sparked an angry backlash among conservative parents. The tensions were later exacerbated by news of a sexual assault in a high school girls\u2019 bathroom perpetrated by a boy who was wearing a skirt at the time. Loudoun\u2019s increasingly ",
      " became spectator events, attracting the sustained attention of right-wing media outlets like Fox News and The New York Post.",
      "Youngkin held \u201cSave Our Schools\u201d rallies and pledged to ban C.R.T. from the state\u2019s schools. But his campaign\u2019s internal education polls revealed a wide range of voter priorities across the state. The race and gender issues that resonated with his base \u2014 Trump voters \u2014 weren\u2019t going to be enough to win. He microtargeted other education voters with different ads; it was a scattershot approach, though, at least until a gubernatorial debate in late September.",
      "During his tenure as governor, McAuliffe had vetoed a bill \u2014 prompted by a mother who objected to her high school senior son\u2019s reading Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved\u201d in an A.P. English class \u2014 that would have enabled parents to prevent their children from studying material they deemed sexually explicit. When Youngkin criticized that decision on the debate stage, ",
      ", \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d",
      "Recognizing that they had just been handed a political gift, Youngkin\u2019s staff cobbled together a digital and TV ad that very night, hoping to take advantage of the apparent gaffe before McAuliffe tried to clarify it. \u201cI was sure he was going to walk it back on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019\u201d Roe told me. Instead, McAuliffe stood by his comment, saying that states and local school boards should have authority over what\u2019s taught in schools.",
      "Youngkin unified his diffuse education campaign under a new phrase, ",
      " printing up T-shirts and bumper stickers and holding Parents Matter rallies in suburban and exurban counties that supported Biden in 2020. McAuliffe\u2019s quote became the centerpiece of a rolling series of ads accusing him of going \u201con the attack against parents.\u201d A longtime critic of organized labor, Youngkin also sought to drive a wedge between teachers and their unions, promising to devote at least $100 million to raise teacher salaries while at the same time saying that McAuliffe would bow to his special-interest allies rather than doing what\u2019s best for children.",
      "A vast majority of Virginia\u2019s teachers belong to the N.E.A., which tends to cover more rural areas, not the A.F.T., whose members are generally concentrated in big cities. But Weingarten was friendly with McAuliffe from the Clinton days and was supporting his candidacy on Twitter and cable news, and the A.F.T. was helping him develop his education platform. Weingarten told me that she called McAuliffe after the debate to tell him that he was wrong \u2014 that parents should have a role in their children\u2019s education. \u201cTerry made a very bad mistake, which Youngkin capitalized on,\u201d she said. (Through a spokesman, McAuliffe said that he talked to Weingarten regularly during the campaign but has no recollection of her criticizing his remark.)",
      "By the fall of 2021, America\u2019s public schools were fully open, but mask mandates were still being hotly contested. Weingarten had been working to try to rebuild trust between some families and their schools. In late September, just a couple of days after the McAuliffe debate, she held a virtual town hall on mask mandates with Open Schools USA, an anti-masking right-wing parents\u2019 rights group that was rallying families to pull their children out of public schools, in an effort to foster open dialogue with the union\u2019s critics.",
      "Under Weingarten, who was elected president of the A.F.T. in 2008, the national union has gone all in on electoral politics, significantly increasing its political spending in the belief that the best way to serve its rank and file is by electing Democrats. The A.F.T. gave more than $1 million to McAuliffe, and Weingarten even knocked on doors for him in Alexandria. But Youngkin had the momentum in the final weeks of the race. His candidacy received another boost in October when Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the F.B.I. to help address the rising threats of violence toward some school-board members. The order stemmed from a letter written to the Biden administration by the National School Boards Association, asking that federal law enforcement address threats against public school officials that \u201ccould be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism.\u201d But Republican lawmakers and the right-wing media seized on the language in the letter to ",
      " \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d Youngkin quickly exploited the opportunity, releasing an ad claiming that the F.B.I. was trying to \u201csilence parents.\u201d",
      "On the night before the election, Weingarten headed down to Virginia to warm up the crowd at McAuliffe\u2019s closing rally in Fairfax County. She was eager to be on hand for the final push, and her staff asked for her to be given a speaking role at the rally. Because she had been such a generous and loyal supporter of McAuliffe\u2019s, the campaign didn\u2019t want to say no, even though some Democrats worried that they could be handing Youngkin another gift.",
      "Politically speaking, Weingarten played perfectly into Youngkin\u2019s Parents Matter campaign. That spring, a right-wing watchdog group, Americans for Public Trust, had gotten hold of email communications between top officials at the A.F.T. and the C.D.C. about the agency\u2019s school-reopening guidelines through the Freedom of Information Act and had passed them on to The New York Post. The tabloid, which had been gleefully attacking Weingarten for years \u2014 dubbing her Whine-garten \u2014 trumpeted the story: ",
      " The rest of the right-wing media and numerous Republican officials instantly jumped on the narrative. Senator Susan Collins of Maine grilled the C.D.C.\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, at a committee hearing over what she called the C.D.C.\u2019s \u201csecret negotiations\u201d with the teachers\u2019 union. Weingarten told me that the C.D.C. had solicited the A.F.T.\u2019s input and that the union hadn\u2019t suggested anything that the agency wasn\u2019t already considering incorporating into its guidelines. But the appearance of a partisan union leader who had privately discussed the future of the nation\u2019s schools with a government agency could be counterproductive in Virginia\u2019s charged political climate.",
      "Youngkin\u2019s staff was giddy at the prospect. \u201cI wanted to send them a gift basket,\u201d Kristin Davison, another senior Youngkin strategist, told me. \u201cIt was almost as good as when Stacey Abrams came.\u201d Republican elected officials around the country took potshots at their emerging villain. \u201cThe union boss responsible for shutting down schools is the final surrogate for Terry McAuliffe\u2019s failing campaign,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote on Twitter. \u201cVirginians should vote accordingly!\u201d",
      "Youngkin won narrowly, motivating the G.O.P. base and making critical inroads in Loudoun, which had voted overwhelmingly for Biden. \u201cFor a closer for a campaign, you would think you would bring in a showstopper,\u201d Betsy DeVos gloated on Fox News on election night. \u201cI guess, in this case, he did bring in a showstopper in Randi Weingarten, because she definitely stopped the show for kids across the country.\u201d",
      "may be too progressive, but to some members of her own union, she is not progressive enough. As the pandemic dragged on, she found herself caught between the wishes of the Democratic establishment she did not want to alienate and the left-leaning rank and file she represented. In Chicago, this tension came down, in early 2022, to the most elemental question for unions: whether or not to strike.",
      "At the time, the new Omicron variant was surging, and Illinois was experiencing a record number of Covid cases and hospitalizations. The A.F.T.\u2019s left-wing local, the Chicago Teachers Union, was concerned about sending its 25,000 members back to the classroom after winter break. The union was hearing similar worries from the Black families whose children make up a large percentage of the 320,000 students in Chicago\u2019s public schools. Many white suburban and exurban parents had been desperate to see their children return to the classroom and were now committed to keeping them there; but many urban Black parents \u2014 who tended to live in smaller homes with more family members, had generally lower vaccination rates and had lost more loved ones to the pandemic \u2014 had been and remained wary, especially with a new variant spiking.",
      "The union demanded mandatory testing for all teachers and students or a temporary return to remote learning. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, balked. President Biden and other prominent Democrats had been unambiguous about their desire for the ",
      " And the recent governor\u2019s election in Virginia had underscored the political danger of introducing more disruptions to in-person learning, especially with the 2022 midterms just around the corner. For Weingarten and the national union, a strike in the country\u2019s third-largest school system would obviously be politically costly.",
      "The insurgent group that leads the C.T.U. first came together in 2008, when the bipartisan education-reform movement was sweeping across the country, dividing the Democratic Party. Centrist billionaires and centrist Democrats joined forces to lead the effort to introduce more testing, accountability and free-market competition to the public schools. But the more progressive wing of the party viewed these measures as an attack on the very institution of public education, unleashing the forces of capitalism on what is supposed to be a public good.",
      "In Chicago, the reform efforts were led by Arne Duncan, the chief executive of the city\u2019s public-school district and President Obama\u2019s future education secretary. \u201cNeoliberal education reform hit Chicago like a ton of bricks,\u201d Jesse Sharkey, a high school history teacher, told me. Sharkey was a leader of this insurgency and would go on to become president of the C.T.U. from 2018 to 2022. \u201cYou\u2019d flip on the TV or pick up a newspaper, and you couldn\u2019t avoid hearing our so-called leaders trashing our schools, talking about their culture of failure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an environment that was downright hostile to public education.\u201d",
      "Sharkey and his fellow insurgents didn\u2019t believe the national union was fighting aggressively enough against these Democratic reformers. Tapping into Chicago\u2019s long history of community-based organizing, they built their own grass-roots movement within the union called the Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators, or CORE. Led by Karen Lewis, a chemistry teacher and union activist, CORE challenged the C.T.U.\u2019s incumbent leadership in 2010 and won control of the Chicago union. Two years later, after the city\u2019s new Democratic mayor, President Obama\u2019s former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, embarked on an ambitious program to close public schools and replace them with charters, the C.T.U. called ",
      " in 25 years. While the C.T.U. was voting on the strike authorization, Weingarten arrived in Chicago to appear on a panel with Emanuel at a conference hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative. It was a stunning turn of events that spoke to the tension between the A.F.T. and its left wing. For the political health of the union, Weingarten felt she needed to preserve her relationships with the country\u2019s most powerful Democratic leaders, many of whom, like Emanuel, were centrist reformers.",
      "As the 2012 strike wore on, Emanuel tried to turn the city against the teachers, accusing them of using ",
      " and unsuccessfully sought a court order to force them to return to work. After seven days, the city backed down; the union won major concessions, including a 16 percent raise over four years and the right for teachers who were laid off as part of Emanuel\u2019s ongoing school closures to be given priority for positions at other schools. The strike instantly became a galvanizing event for the union\u2019s more progressive members. Not only does CORE still control the C.T.U., but like-minded left-wing slates have since taken control of A.F.T. locals in several other cities, too, including Los Angeles and Baltimore.",
      "These insurgent caucuses are unified by what they call \u201csocial justice unionism.\u201d They see public schools\u2019 ongoing struggles to educate their students as inseparable from the larger societal and economic issues facing their working-class members and the poor communities whose children dominate their classrooms. \u201cWe are trying to promote a brand of unionism that goes all out in its fight for educational justice and is brave about taking on conflicts,\u201d Sharkey says. \u201cIn some ways, we\u2019re less careful about who we piss off nationally.\u201d",
      "There is a natural tension between these insurgent movements and the more establishment-oriented national union. In 2015, some rank-and-file members protested the A.F.T.\u2019s decision to issue an early endorsement of Hillary Clinton, to whom Weingarten is close, who was running against the pro-labor Bernie Sanders. But the tension is about more than just politics; it also goes to the heart of the A.F.T.\u2019s identity. To these caucuses, the union\u2019s power comes from the collective strength of its members \u2014 from the bottom up \u2014 which can conflict with the top-down leadership style of Weingarten, who has cultivated a distinct public profile, sometimes characterized by her own tendency toward political hyperbole. An impulsive user of Twitter, she has been known to send out the occasional overheated message. During the pandemic, when DeSantis supporters were selling \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci My Florida\u201d merchandise, including beer koozies, on the G.O.P.\u2019s WinRed website, she wrote: \u201cDisgusting. Millions of Floridians are going to ",
      "\u201d She later apologized for the tweet. ",
      "Two days after returning from winter break in January 2022, with their demands still unmet, the C.T.U. called a strike. \u201cThe union isn\u2019t stupid,\u201d Sharkey, who was president at the time, told me. \u201cWe knew people were sick of the pandemic.\u201d But, he went on, \u201cfor better or for worse we\u2019re a union that strikes. We didn\u2019t think it would be an easy or strategically wise thing, but there was a principle around it. It was something we had to do.\u201d",
      "The union already had a contentious relationship with Lightfoot, dating back to an 11-day strike over wages and class sizes in 2019 that ended with the city making major concessions. This time, though, the mayor had public opinion on her side, and she leveraged it in a flurry of media interviews, accusing the C.T.U. of holding Chicago\u2019s children \u201chostage.\u201d Lightfoot had long seen the A.F.T.\u2019s local as a \u201cpolitical movement\u201d whose ambitions extended well beyond protecting the rights of its workers. \u201cI think, ultimately, they\u2019d like to take over ",
      " but take over running the city government,\u201d she told The Times in 2021.",
      "The 2022 strike quickly became a political nightmare for national Democrats: A Democratic mayor was at war with a Democratic union, shutting down Chicago\u2019s schools at a moment when children were finally back in the classroom and the country was just beginning to confront the learning loss and emotional trauma caused by the pandemic. Splinter groups of teachers in Northern California were also planning sickouts in the face of the Omicron surge. The Chicago strike put Weingarten in a difficult position. Publicly, she supported the C.T.U., while also saying that children needed to be in the classroom. Behind the scenes, she was calling and texting Sharkey constantly, offering to do anything she could \u2014 even arrange a call with people at the White House \u2014 to help press Lightfoot and end the strike. After a few days, under intensifying public pressure, the C.T.U.\u2019s members voted to return to work. They had lost this battle, but they already had their sights on a bigger one: the city\u2019s upcoming mayoral election.",
      " before the 2022 midterms, the results from the first full National Assessment of Educational Progress since the start of the pandemic were released, revealing that 40 percent of the country\u2019s eighth-grade public-school students were not proficient in math, and 32 percent were not proficient in reading. The strikingly low scores instantly became a G.O.P. talking point: The culprit wasn\u2019t the pandemic, schools or teachers but the unions and Democratic politicians beholden to them. \u201cWe cannot let the nation forget how teachers\u2019 unions tried to hold our children\u2019s futures for ransom,\u201d said Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, then the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \u201cThese union bosses, and the politicians who enabled them, must be held accountable.\u201d Republicans up and down the ballot accused their Democratic opponents of carrying water for the teachers\u2019 unions. A week before the election, Fox News ran a segment headlined \u201cHave the Teachers Unions Sold Out Your Kids to the Democrats?\u201d",
      "Christopher Rufo, the right-wing activist who manufactured the obsession with C.R.T. two years earlier, was now on Fox News railing against another crisis \u2014 the ",
      " that he charged was being \u201cmainlined\u201d into America\u2019s public schools \u2014 while Republican candidates condemned the \u201cgrooming\u201d of children to identify as different genders in the nation\u2019s classrooms. Many Republican candidates pledged their allegiance to a \u201cParents\u2019 Bill of Rights,\u201d requiring schools to provide information on reading lists, curriculums and whether a family\u2019s child used another name or pronoun in school.",
      "The A.F.T. spent in excess of $20 million in the 2022 midterms, more than it ever had in an off-year election, and Weingarten campaigned tirelessly with high-profile Democrats around the country, her arrival on the stump invariably inspiring glee among local Republican leaders. When she appeared in Michigan with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, one G.O.P. pundit, Kaylee McGhee White, described her on Fox Business Network as \u201cthe kiss of death.\u201d Whitmer won easily, as did many other Democrats whose opponents had railed against drag-queen shows for children or L.G.B.T.Q.-themed books in school libraries. But Republican candidates who campaigned on another education issue \u2014 school choice \u2014 fared much better.",
      "As a political matter, all the education battles that had erupted since the start of the pandemic \u2014 over school closures, over how the country\u2019s racial history should be taught, over what sort of role parents ought to have in the classroom \u2014 were really about the same thing: whether America\u2019s children should continue to be educated in government-run public schools. Did the pandemic and the culture wars reveal the indispensability of these schools to their communities and to the broader fabric of the nation, or did they only underscore their inherent limitations \u2014 in effect, making the case for school choice?",
      "It was the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman who first proposed the modern concept of school vouchers in a paper in 1955. Friedman was a champion of free markets, and his idea was to leverage the transformative power of capitalism to prod schools to compete for families\u2019 dollars. But vouchers served another purpose too. The Supreme Court had just ruled on Brown v. Board of Education, and many white Americans were worried about the looming prospect of being forced to send their children to desegregated schools. ",
      ", writing, \u201cUnder such a system, there can develop exclusively white schools, exclusively colored schools and mixed schools.\u201d",
      "Thirty years later, with Friedman serving as an economic adviser, President Reagan tried repeatedly to introduce federal school-voucher legislation. One of his most vocal opponents was Al Shanker, then the A.F.T.\u2019s president, who argued that choice might be the point of \u201cshopping malls,\u201d but it was not the point of education, nor was it the reason taxpayers were expected to fund the nation\u2019s public schools: \u201cWe do so not to satisfy the individual wants of parents and students but because of the public interest in producing an educated citizenry capable of exercising the rights of liberty and being productive members of society.\u201d",
      "Even Congress, where Republicans held the Senate majority, considered Reagan\u2019s voucher proposals too radical. But the concept endured. In the 1990s, vouchers were championed by Christian conservatives like Paul Weyrich, a founder of the Heritage Foundation and mentor to Justice Clarence Thomas. Weyrich believed that the nation\u2019s public schools had become \u201cmorally decadent institutions\u201d and argued that the only answer was for Christians to educate their children themselves, ideally with government money. Over the years, some states experimented with limited voucher programs, typically designed to target discrete populations like children with special needs. But the pandemic created an opening for voucher advocates to think more ambitiously and move more aggressively. In fact, this had been the plan almost from the very beginning. Two months into the school closures, in the spring of 2020, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Catholic archbishop of New York, asked DeVos \u2014 then the education secretary and a longtime supporter of school choice \u2014 in an interview on SiriusXM radio if she intended to \u201cutilize this particular crisis to ensure that justice is finally done to our kids and the parents who choose to send them to faith-based schools.\u201d ",
      ": \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d",
      "In 2021, at least 18 states created new school-choice programs or expanded existing ones, and more followed suit in 2022. Some of these new programs represent a significant departure from those of the past. Known collectively as universal voucher programs, they are available to everyone and can be applied toward any kind of school. The goal is not merely to disrupt public education but to defund and dismantle it. For years, the country\u2019s lower courts largely agreed that spending taxpayer money on religious schools was unconstitutional. But last summer, the Supreme Court created a new precedent, ruling that it was in fact ",
      " \u2014 in this case, one in rural Maine \u2014 to ",
      " religious schools.",
      "DeVos, now back in the private sector, is one of the leading funders of this new national voucher campaign, primarily through an organization that she helped found called the American Federation for Children. The group and its affiliates spent $9 million on school-choice campaigns in 2022, at least $2.5 million of which came directly from DeVos and her husband. They spent much of this money in the primaries, turning support for school choice into a litmus test and targeting Republican incumbents opposed to it. Three-quarters of the candidates they supported won. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a red wave or a blue wave in the midterms, but there was a school-choice wave,\u201d Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at the American Federation for Children, wrote to me in an email. Echoing Weyrich\u2019s sentiments about the moral decadence of American public education, DeAngelis quoted Voddie Baucham, a Christian home-schooling advocate: \u201cWe cannot continue to send our children to Caesar for their education and be surprised when they come home as Romans.\u201d",
      "DeAngelis identified Weingarten as a useful political foil long before Mike Pompeo. He has been trolling her relentlessly on Twitter since 2021, ostentatiously thanking her for starting \u201cthe school choice revolution.\u201d In March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, he posed with a life-size cardboard cutout of her clutching an award labeled \u201cThreat to America\u2019s Children,\u201d his left thumb raised in approval.",
      " of Chicago, was right about the local teachers\u2019 union\u2019s political ambitions. In February, Brandon Johnson, a former middle-school teacher and paid union organizer, challenged her in the city\u2019s mayoral election. It was a long shot \u2014 one early poll put his support at 3 percent \u2014 but for the C.T.U., the Johnson campaign was a natural progression. To pursue their broader agenda, which reaches beyond education into areas like housing and policing, they needed the kind of power that can come only from winning partisan political elections. And they had both a powerful grass-roots movement and a source of campaign funds, in the form of members\u2019 dues, that could be leveraged to support Johnson\u2019s candidacy.",
      "Johnson\u2019s campaign was underwritten largely by the teachers\u2019 unions. Though the A.F.T. and the C.T.U. had their differences in the past, they have become more closely aligned in recent years. While there are still some divisions within the Democratic Party over education policy, the bipartisan education-reform movement that once posed such a formidable existential threat to the A.F.T. is a shadow of its former self. The threat to the A.F.T. is now partisan, which means that Weingarten is no longer facing as much pressure from centrist Democrats. Backed by the financial and organizational muscle of the national and local teachers\u2019 unions, Johnson knocked Lightfoot out of the two-person runoff, making her the first incumbent mayor in Chicago to be unseated after a single term in 40 years.",
      "By now, Pompeo, Tim Scott, Marco Rubio, Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump and the rest of the Republican Party were busy elevating education to a central plank in its 2024 platform and in the process transforming Weingarten into the new Hillary \u2014 a G.O.P. stand-in for everything that was wrong with America. The Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic was continuing to build its case that Weingarten and the A.F.T. exerted undue influence over the C.D.C.\u2019s school-reopening guidelines, summoning ",
      " on April 26 at a hearing titled \u201cThe Consequences of School Closures.\u201d",
      "But Weingarten was building her own case. Public education was now itself a hyperpartisan issue, and she addressed it in hyperpartisan terms in a ",
      " Calling out by name some of the people who had demonized her since the pandemic, including Betsy DeVos, she described the ongoing effort to defund public schools as nothing less than a threat to \u201ccornerstones of community, of our democracy, our economy and our nation.\u201d She pointed to studies that have shown that vouchers don\u2019t improve student achievement, characterizing them as a back door into private and parochial schools that are not subject to the same federal civil rights laws as public institutions and can therefore promote discrimination. \u201cOur public schools shouldn\u2019t be pawns for politicians\u2019 ambitions!\u201d she thundered, moving toward her emotional conclusion. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be defunded or destroyed by ideologues.\u201d",
      "Like the Virginia\u2019s governor\u2019s race one and a half years earlier, Chicago\u2019s mayoral runoff became, at least in part, a referendum on education. The effects of the pandemic on Chicago\u2019s public schools have been profound. More than 33,000 ",
      " since the fall of 2020, and the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress scores showed steep declines in math and a widening achievement gap between white and Black students.",
      "Brandon Johnson\u2019s opponent, Paul Vallas, ran Chicago\u2019s public schools in the late 1990s. Chicago has no Republican Party to speak of, but Vallas, a vocal proponent of charter schools and vouchers, was the conservative candidate. In 2009, he said he was \u201cmore of a Republican than a Democrat.\u201d He was supported by the local business community and endorsed by the city\u2019s police union. A group affiliated with the American Federation for Children spent $60,285 on a pro-Vallas digital media effort. But Arne Duncan and a number of other centrist Democrats endorsed Vallas, too.",
      "On the eve of the April runoff election, Weingarten headed to Chicago to speak at a Johnson political rally headlined by Bernie Sanders. Both the A.F.T. and the C.T.U. continued to funnel money into Johnson\u2019s campaign as the election approached, their combined contributions totaling $4.6 million. \u201cAll of this stuff is about power,\u201d observed a local community activist, Ja\u2019Mal Green, who had run in the first round of the election but didn\u2019t make the runoff and was now supporting Vallas.",
      "When Johnson narrowly won, it was a stunning upset, not just for the candidate but for the left. Even as the Republicans were ramping up their attacks on Weingarten and on the institution of public education, the teachers\u2019 unions had effectively elected the mayor of America\u2019s third-largest city, who was himself an avowedly progressive union organizer promising to raise taxes on the rich, reform the police and increase funding for the city\u2019s schools. Maybe Pompeo hadn\u2019t been wrong, at least as far as his own party was concerned. It was those who had underestimated the political power of the unions who were mistaken. \u201cThey said this would never happen,\u201d ",

      "Kyrsten Sinema was standing a few yards from the border wall with four Republican members of Congress. The men were staring balefully at a row of nearby portable toilets, wondering aloud if they could hold out for a proper bathroom on the way back to the airport. Sinema assured Representatives David Valadao of California and Tony Gonzales of Texas that they need not worry on her account.",
      "\u201cIf you know anything about me,\u201d she said, gesturing vaguely out into the desert, \u201cyou know that I\u2019ll go anywhere.\u201d The two men, who were just getting to know the Arizona senator, laughed. \u201cI mean,\u201d Sinema added as she pointed back to the porta-potties, \u201cI come from humble beginnings. That there is some fancy [expletive].\u201d",
      "Valadao, Gonzales and the two other elected officials, Representative Juan Ciscomani of Arizona and Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, all wore jeans and nondescript shirts. Sinema, dressed in a black Western shirt with a white yoke and black jeans with matching spectacles and cowboy boots, exercised her full array of Republican-charming skills throughout the morning. Standing at the wall, she had a detailed exchange with a Border Patrol official for the benefit of the visitors about how Mexican drug cartels managed to ferry fentanyl into Arizona and beyond. At a round-table discussion in the Cochise County sheriff\u2019s office, she moderated a brisk dialogue between her congressional colleagues and beleaguered local officials whose once-quiet communities were now plagued by cartel associates. When the four Republicans responded with harsh criticisms of the Biden administration, Sinema nodded sympathetically, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Sinema \u2014 who four months earlier left the Democratic Party and declared herself an independent \u2014 had orchestrated this April visit for two reasons, one explicit and the other hinted at. The four men joining her at the border had been \u201ccarefully curated\u201d by Sinema, she told me the day before. Tillis had partnered with her on important legislation in the past, and they were now collaborating on what they hoped would be the first major border-and-immigration-reform bill to become law in a generation. Sinema targeted Ciscomani, Gonzales and Valadao, all of whom served on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, as potential recruits for this effort.",
      "Like two other recent legislative accomplishments that Sinema had a major hand in crafting \u2014 the 2021 infrastructure bill and the 2022 gun-safety initiative \u2014 the Sinema-Tillis plan is decidedly half a loaf, for which Sinema offers no apologies. \u201cThe people who want no bread if they can\u2019t get the entire loaf of bread,\u201d she told me, \u201care people who\u2019ve never been hungry.\u201d",
      "But even if less than a full meal, the plan would still be consequential \u2014 increasing funds and equipment for the Border Patrol, reforming the asylum process, addressing backlogs of employment-based visas and providing a path to citizenship for about two million young American residents (the so-called Dreamers) \u2014 and its passage would be an even more improbable achievement than finding common ground on guns last year. \u201cGuns is a high-wire act,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who worked with Sinema on the 2022 law and is now doing the same on immigration, told me. \u201cImmigration is a high-wire act while holding active sticks of dynamite.\u201d",
      "Unlike those earlier legislative tightrope walks, Sinema, who is known for avoiding the news media, was performing this one in public, accompanied by a half-dozen members of the Arizona press as well as myself. It was clear, if unstated, that this was the second reason for going to the border, which most Democrats have assiduously stayed away from amid growing Republican criticism: her 2024 re-election bid. She never once raised the subject during our four interviews over two months. When I did, a day before the border visit, she cheerfully replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question. But I\u2019m glad you started with it. Got it right out of the way!\u201d",
      "\u201cCan you answer at least when you believe you\u2019ll have to make up your mind?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIf you do ",
      " run, or if you run and are defeated, do you have a plan for what you would do next?\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, not really thinking about that.\u201d",
      " had been apparent for months. Why else would she have left the Democratic Party four years into her term, if not to avoid a primary in which the party\u2019s progressive base was guaranteed to turn its wrath on her? Why else was she (as ",
      ") furtively holding staff retreats to lay out a timetable for commissioning polls and opposition research? Nothing she said in our conversations left me with the impression that she was putting a few final touches on her senatorial legacy on her way out the door to the private sector. At the same time, Sinema \u2014 whom even her closest friends describe as calculated, and who described herself to me as \u201cvery intentional\u201d and \u201ca planner\u201d \u2014 almost never telegraphs her strategy. It suited her ends to freeze the 2024 machinations by leaving everyone guessing.",
      "Still, here she was, flanked by Republican legislators and border officials, blanketing the state\u2019s airwaves 19 months before what is sure to be the most complicated race of her two decades in electoral politics. It will also be, aside from the presidential election itself, the most significant contest next year, and it may well decide which party controls the Senate. Over the past two years, the Democrats (with independents) have held the majority by no more than two votes, which has allowed Sinema and another centrist Democrat, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, to command extraordinary influence over the party\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "If Arizona progressives have their way, Sinema will be ousted for repeated apostasies, from protecting the filibuster \u2014 the means by which, according to traditional Senate rules, a minority can block a vote that a frustrated majority would otherwise be able to move forward \u2014 to siding with private-equity donors. If Sinema has hers, Arizona voters across the political spectrum will reward her displays of discerning bipartisanship in an age of mindless party loyalty. It could also be the case that Sinema and her likely Democratic rival, Representative Ruben Gallego, will do sufficient damage to each other to ensure that the winner is a Republican, perhaps losing the Senate majority in the process.",
      "But additional implications come into play should Sinema prevail as an independent. \u201cThese are very different times,\u201d Tillis told me, \u201cand from the polls I\u2019ve seen, an increasing number of voters are saying, \u2018I\u2019m not buying what the far left and far right are selling.\u2019 Now, whether that sentiment transfers to an electoral map is still unclear. But if voters really are saying, \u2018Give me a viable alternative,\u2019 then Sinema has a pretty solid argument to make.\u201d",
      "Her test case, if it succeeds, could in turn rattle the foundation of a two-party system that has held sway in America for a century. It\u2019s still a big \u201cif.\u201d A survey conducted in January by the Democratic pollster Jill Normington shows ",
      " With no affiliated party to support her \u2014 with two parties, rather than just one, actively working to defeat her \u2014 the incumbent is gambling that she can attract donors and elected surrogates who are willing to risk angering others in their partisan tribe by supporting her. Since announcing his candidacy in late January, Gallego has outraised Sinema, $3.7 million to $2.1 million, but she has almost four times as much money in the bank as he does.",
      "Most of all, she is betting that her lawmaking acumen will attract a new coalition of Arizona voters. No one unaffiliated with either of the two parties has ever won statewide office there. For Sinema to do so, according to Chuck Coughlin, a prominent Republican consultant in Arizona, \u201cshe needs 20 to 25 percent of Democratic voters, 25 to 30 percent of Republicans and 50 to 60 percent of self-identified independents.\u201d",

      " against Donald Trump in 2020, as well as Gov. Katie Hobbs, who received almost 11 percent of the Republican vote in her 2022 victory over the far-right Kari Lake.",
      "Of course, those candidates also benefited from their party\u2019s overwhelming support. Sinema, even before she left the party in December, had become the Democrat whom Democrats love to hate.

      " (Sinema says she voted as she did because the minimum-wage provision did not belong in a reconciliation bill, which must be budgetary in nature to qualify for passage by a simple majority. A spokeswoman also says that she curtsied out of gratitude for the Senate clerk\u2019s late-hour labors and that she was not the only senator that night who signified \u201cno\u201d using the thumbs-down gesture.)",

      " \u201cThe decision was really a no-brainer,\u201d a former state party official told me, adding that the censure resolution was supported by more than 90 percent of Arizona\u2019s Democratic precinct committee members. In a foreshadowing of her formal break from the party, Sinema endorsed but did not campaign for any of her fellow Arizona Democrats during the 2022 midterms, including two longtime friends, Katie Hobbs and the attorney general candidate Kris Mayes, both of whom won, but barely. Mayes in particular needed all the help she could get, prevailing by a mere 280 votes. Hobbs, on the other hand, relied heavily on the turnout of a progressive base that might have reacted poorly to Sinema\u2019s presence on the stump. To campaign for one and not the other would have underscored just how problematic Sinema had become for her fellow Democrats.",
      "All that said, by Coughlin\u2019s calculation, Sinema will still have to garner the support of 20 to 25 percent of Arizona\u2019s Democrats who are somehow unbothered by the spectacle of their former Democratic senator now chumming it up with Republicans while disparaging the Biden administration. The notion that wooing Democrats is likely to be Sinema\u2019s most difficult task constitutes a striking reversal in the political career of a prominent Arizona progressive whose election to the Senate in 2018 was celebrated by the party as a historic breakthrough.",
      "Since that high moment, their shared history has been like a marriage of convenience in which they shamelessly used the other until, perhaps inevitably, they came to have only distrust in common. By ending the charade, Sinema is gambling that she can manage the fallout and ultimately be rewarded for her declaration of independence. Whether that happens \u2014 whether she succeeds in making her case as America\u2019s indispensable consensus builder in the Senate \u2014 depends in no small measure on whether the party Sinema left behind can remember more than just the bad times.",

      "\u201cTake the time to be OK with yourself,\u201d Sinema answered. \u201cIf someone says something bad about you, it falls in a place that\u2019s soft. But if you\u2019re OK with yourself, you know that what they\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t matter, and it doesn\u2019t land so hard.\u201d",
      "At times, Sinema employs the empathic language of the social worker she was straight out of college. Even in those moments, however, she is never one to mince words, or to linger. Sinema observes no religious faith, but she is worshipful of efficiency. She obtained advanced degrees \u2014 a J.D., a Ph.D. in justice studies and an M.B.A. \u2014 the same years, respectively, in which she won seats to the State House (2004), the U.S. House (2012) and the U.S. Senate (2018).

The scheduling misstep, Sinema said, had been handled. \u201cI don\u2019t waste emotions,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t have guilt or regret, because those are useless emotions.\u201d When I suggested that guilt could be a constructive force for change, Sinema corrected me. Remorse could be constructive, she said. Guilt could not: \u201cIt\u2019s a useless emotion that hurts you, and nothing else.\u201d",

Desai, a prominent election-law attorney who represented Arizona\u2019s secretary of state in 2020 election cases, once served as campaign counsel to Sinema, who had recommended her to Biden\u2019s team. Sinema ran to catch Romney after his vote. She asked him to reconsider, adding that Desai was a personal friend. Romney told me: \u201cShe responded to my concerns and convinced me to go back and change my vote. And I wouldn\u2019t do that for just anybody.\u201d Desai would ultimately be confirmed by a vote of 67 to 29, with more bipartisan support than any federal judicial nominee had received in over 20 years.",
      "Sinema told me that Biden\u2019s chief of staff at the time, Ron Klain, had expressed doubts that she could find any Republican support for Desai. It was this lack of faith in Sinema\u2019s abilities that compelled her to later \u2014 at a fund-raiser filled with ",

      "Though it has frequently been reported that the independent senator would \u201ccontinue to caucus with the Democrats,\u201d Sinema told me this was misleading: She almost never showed up to Democratic meetings to begin with, as they tended to be profligate time wasters. Nor does she adhere to the Beltway ritual of appearing on the Sunday talk shows. In her view, they produce only \u201cnoise,\u201d though it\u2019s also the case that Sinema\u2019s sometimes cutting utterances do not come off well in such staid settings. Her aversion to publicly revealing her hand differentiates Sinema from Manchin, a voluble regular on the Sunday shows.",
      "Some have inferred from her reticence that Sinema either is incapable of defending her positions or has no actual positions to defend \u2014 that she arrives at her decisions capriciously and only after drawing maximum attention to herself. To her friends, like Murphy, the former congresswoman, this view bears more than a whiff of sexism and misses the point: \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s playing the inside game, rather than the media game, demonstrates that she\u2019s a professional who shows respect for people, even the ones who\u2019ve disrespected her. If you\u2019re a real legislator and you want to get stuff done, you have to build trust. The minute you call the press or sic the activists on someone to try and apply pressure, you\u2019ve lost that person\u2019s trust.\u201d",
      "I asked Sinema if she found it surprising that someone of her unorthodox character would come to be regarded as a kind of throwback to a less-partisan era, even as a Senate institutionalist. \u201cI think what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she evenly replied, \u201cis you\u2019re mistaking someone who\u2019s not interested in marching to someone else\u2019s drum or following their rules, which are petty and dumb, as being somehow incompatible with wanting to preserve and protect the fundamentals of our democracy.\u201d",
      " Kyrsten Sinema \u2014 14 years old at the time but considerably younger in appearance \u2014 stood before the school board in DeFuniak Springs, Fla., accompanied by her high school guidance counselor, Cynthia Jeselnik. The girl explained that she had already taken every required and honors class her school had to offer. Now she wished to take courses at Okaloosa-Walton Community College (now Northwest Florida State College), 31 miles away in Niceville. Her goal, as Jeselnik would recall to me, \u201cwas to graduate early, so that she could get on with her life and with the course she had laid out for herself.\u201d",
      "The young honors student did not have to state the obvious, which was that she saw no future for herself in a rural community with a poverty rate that was close to 25 percent. Nor did she share the particulars of her personal life, with either her counselor or the board: how she had been born into a comfortable middle-class family in Tucson, Ariz., and had nurtured ambitions since she was 6, when she proclaimed to her first-grade teacher that she intended one day to be a U.S. senator and an author; how her world caved in when her father, an attorney, was disbarred for \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, deceit and misrepresentation\u201d in 1983; how the family\u2019s car was subsequently repossessed and her mother, a devout Mormon, left the marriage and became involved with a teacher in the girl\u2019s elementary school; how she, her two siblings, her mother and her new stepfather abruptly left Arizona, driving cross-country to his family\u2019s community in DeFuniak Springs; how the family, with the stepfather struggling to find work, lived for nearly three years in a former gas station, while she and her siblings wore hand-me-down clothes provided by the local Mormon church and ate meals provided by the church and federal food assistance.",
      "What she did say, when the board members advised her simply to find some way to busy herself at her high school, was: \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste a year doing this. Why are you holding me back?\u201d",
      "The school board acquiesced, and the girl, now 15, then drove her parents\u2019 car without a license to take night classes in Niceville. A year later, Sinema was ready to graduate as Walton High School\u2019s co-valedictorian. When she learned that only a member of the senior class could qualify for that top distinction, she and Jeselnik again petitioned school officials. \u201cThese are dumb rules,\u201d Sinema informed them, a preview of how she would later view Beltway mores.",
      "\u201cShe ended up getting a couple of school-district policies changed,\u201d her former counselor recalled. But other things the 16-year-old girl could not alter. Sinema had both the grades and the desire to apply to Harvard. Her parents, however, would not agree to this. Instead, she went to Brigham Young University, the Mormon institution in Provo, Utah, and her family moved to Utah with her. When she graduated from B.Y.U. just before her 19th birthday, she headed back to Arizona, leaving Utah, the Mormon Church and her family behind for good.",
      "The tightly knit community of Phoenix progressives saw in Sinema a fellow idealist, perhaps not fully appreciating at the time how the emotional scar tissue from her earlier years had hardened her into a survivor. She spent her first years in the city as a social worker, learning Spanish as she handled rough cases involving domestic abuse and shootings in the north-side barrios. Frustrated by her inability to improve the lives of immigrants and low-income families in a more sweeping way, she was urged by a local environmental activist named Sandy Bahr to go to law school or seek elective office. \u201cI suggested those two things,\u201d Bahr recalled, \u201cand she decided to do both at the same time.\u201d",
      "Sinema\u2019s early years as an outspoken liberal voice in Arizona politics would later be used against her \u2014 first by Republicans who mocked her Green Party ties and the ",
      " then by progressives who called her a sellout. At a rally she helped organize in 2002 to protest the Patriot Act, Sinema insisted that anyone bringing a firearm be turned away, explaining later, \u201cWe believe in world disarmament.\u201d That same year, she ran for the State House for the first time, without a party affiliation, declaring that among her chief priorities was \u201cstatewide responsible growth aimed at stopping sprawl.\u201d She finished last among the five candidates.",
      "By 2009, when she published a book titled \u201cUnite and Conquer,\u201d Sinema had settled on a tidy autobiographical summation that she promotes to this day \u2014 that of a lonely \u201cbomb thrower\u201d in the State Legislature who saw the light after a few months of misery and then became a happy consensus builder who \u201cgets stuff done.\u201d As with most political narratives, her distillation is more than a little reductive. Sinema did in fact get stuff done \u2014 notably leading the defeat of a ban on same-sex marriage \u2014 by reaching across the aisle. She did in fact, to the horror of her liberal friends, develop warm relations with Arizona conservatives like State Senator Russell Pearce, the author of the notoriously anti-immigration law known as S.B. 1070 (which allowed Arizona officers to arbitrarily demand a citizen\u2019s immigration papers), and Andy Biggs, the future chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.",
      "But she remained an unambiguous progressive well after she abandoned her bomb-throwing ways. In 2006, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators nationwide marched to protest a House Republican bill aiming to crack down on illegal immigration; a photograph of State Representative Sinema locking arms with Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva and other Arizona Democrats hung in her office for years afterward.",
      "\u201cI see interviews of A.O.C., and I\u2019m always struck by how much she was like Kyrsten in those days,\u201d recalled David Lujan, the Arizona Democrats\u2019 minority leader during Sinema\u2019s tenure, referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat. \u201cShe was ",
      " beloved progressive.\u201d At the same time, Lujan went on, \u201cshe studied polls more than anybody I knew.\u201d",
      " then a New York congressman and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, received a phone call from an Arizona state senator. Israel knew nothing about Kyrsten Sinema, apart from the fact that she was considering running for a seat representing the newly created Ninth Congressional District. Come to Phoenix, she told him, and I\u2019ll give you a rundown of all the likely Democratic candidates. (Sinema says she did not call to suggest the meeting; Israel maintains that she did.)",
      "The two met at the posh Biltmore Hotel, where, as promised, Sinema went through the list of Democratic aspirants, explaining why each of them was unlikely to win the new swing district.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s my point,\u201d she said with a smile.",
      "Caught off-guard, Israel muttered, \u201cWe could\u2019ve done this by phone.\u201d",
      "Holding his gaze, she replied: \u201cI wanted to be in the same room with you. I wanted you to see who I am.\u201d",
      "Impressed but still skeptical, Israel did not put his thumb on the scale for Sinema, who went on to thrash her Democratic opponents in the 2012 primary anyway. After eking out a victory over a Republican Tea Party candidate in November, she was ",

She organized dinner parties at her apartment and taught spinning classes in the House gym. Her flamboyant wardrobe stood out in a city where, she said in a speech to an L.G.B.T.Q. group back home, \u201cthey think that navy is like a fashion-forward choice.\u201d",
      "Having won a hotly contested district, Sinema was immediately designated a \u201cfront line\u201d member by the D.C.C.C. whose seat was at risk for the 2014 cycle. Sinema joined the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate Democrats. She made good on her campaign pledge to vote against Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader. During votes on the House floor, the freshman could be seen staring up at the tally board, openly agonizing, often casting her ballot just as time elapsed. A colleague recalled Sinema\u2019s wrestling with whether to leave the Ninth District and move to a safer one. A former aide remembered that she met with Israel to discuss the matter. He advised her that if she had any future interest in being a senator in a red state like Arizona, staying in a moderate district would improve her prospects. Sinema stayed.",
      "She handily won a second House term, then a third in 2016. Her acumen had become evident to senior members like the minority whip Steny H. Hoyer, who made Sinema his assistant whip in 2014, and her Republican colleague on the Financial Services Committee, Patrick T. McHenry, who told me, \u201cI viewed her as a student of power politics and how to be a meaningful player in the House.\u201d It did not escape McHenry\u2019s notice that Sinema acquired friendships on his side of the aisle \u2014 not just heavy hitters like Kevin McCarthy, the eventual House speaker, but also staunch ideologues like Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma. As the Republicans\u2019 chief deputy whip, McHenry found that whenever he needed Democratic votes, the Democratic assistant whip would be candid about what she could or could not deliver. Sinema, meanwhile, encouraged new moderate members to vote against the party line if it suited them politically \u2014 saying of Pelosi and Hoyer: \u201cThey\u2019ll be mad at you, but they\u2019ll get over it. Vote your district \u2014 it doesn\u2019t help anyone if you lose.\u201d",
      "In September 2017, Sinema declared her candidacy for the Senate against Jeff Flake, the Republican incumbent whose criticisms of President Donald Trump had caused his approval rating to tank back home. Democratic leaders immediately threw their support behind the three-term congresswoman, recognizing that no one else in their party had a shot in a state that had not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1988.",
      "Three weeks after Sinema declared, Flake announced that he would not be seeking another term. While the Republican front-runner, Martha McSally, fought off a primary challenge by wedding herself to Trump, Sinema angled for Arizona\u2019s growing suburban electorate. For the Republican chair of her campaign, she brought on Max Fose, a consultant who had worked with the state\u2019s legendary ",
      " Her campaign slogan became \u201cIndependent, Like You.\u201d She courted major Republican donors. She won endorsements from law-enforcement groups. She voted against repealing Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy (after having voted against the same tax cuts the previous year).",

Two days after her victory, the state\u2019s first female senator-elect returned to Washington to participate in the Democratic caucus\u2019s leadership vote. Though she had pledged not to vote for Senator Chuck Schumer as minority leader, when no challenger emerged, she joined her new colleagues to reinstall him in the role. Explaining her reversal, Sinema said in a statement, \u201cArizonans know I will work with anyone \u2014 in either party \u2014 to get things done for our state.\u201d",
      " she got to the Senate,\u201d Chris Murphy told me, \u201cI could see her during votes spending at least as much time on the Republican side, if not more, chatting them up. At first, I didn\u2019t know what she was doing over there. But then I figured it out. It was coldblooded. She was clearly setting herself up as someone who could bring the two sides together.\u201d",
      "Sinema first introduced herself to Senator Rob Portman, a conservative Republican from Ohio, and his wife back in 2015, while they and others were accompanying John Lewis at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., to commemorate the heroism of Lewis and other civil rights marchers who were brutally beaten by police officers a half-century earlier. \u201cKyrsten is not someone who is difficult to get to know,\u201d Portman told me. Like Sinema, Portman, whose son is gay, was a supporter of same-sex marriage.",
      "It turned out that the two senators had something else in common, which became evident in early 2021, when Sinema began to hold meetings to discuss bipartisan infrastructure legislation. Though several of her colleagues agreed on the worthiness of the endeavor, it was Portman who stayed behind at the first meeting and began working on a spreadsheet.",
      "The new legislative partners began with three baselines. One was Biden\u2019s stated preference that a federal investment in infrastructure be at least $600 billion in new spending. The second was that the bill be limited to only core infrastructure projects, including broadband. The third was Portman\u2019s insistence that the money not come from raising taxes \u2014 a red line that was also to Sinema\u2019s liking, but it was more effective to be able to tell her Democratic colleagues that a tax hike would be a nonstarter among Republicans.",
      "For two months, Sinema and Porter pored over infrastructure frameworks that various Senate committees had previously drawn up. The working group then expanded from two senators to 10, then to 20. They met in various hideaways and Capitol conference rooms. \u201cShe set deadlines, and she asked for deliverables on certain dates,\u201d said Romney, a key participant in the discussions. \u201cI won\u2019t mention names, but there were a few folks in our group, a couple in particular, who were inclined to spin out with various stories and experiences they\u2019d had in the past that they thought were relevant. And she would cut them off, even though they were far senior to her. She would say: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get back to the topic at hand. We need to get this resolved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Romney went on: \u201cAnd there were several times where we faced what we thought were dispositive roadblocks. A lot of us were inclined to say, \u2018OK, we just can\u2019t get there.\u2019\u201d At such moments, members often stormed out. But, Romney told me, \u201cshe would go get them and bring them back. She\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve got to get there. We don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Sinema-Portman infrastructure bill passed the Senate that August on an impressively bipartisan 69-to-30 vote. But its progress in the House was complicated by the multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better social-spending bill championed by Democratic progressives who threatened to hold the infrastructure bill hostage until Sinema and Manchin agreed to pass the bills in tandem. Neither of them would do so. Manchin\u2019s public explanation was that Build Back Better\u2019s cost was too high amid rising inflation, geopolitical instability and the pandemic. Sinema gave no public explanation at all. But she had already privately informed both Schumer and the Biden White House that the highest price tag she would agree to was $1.1 trillion \u2014 and that, as a friend of hers would say, \u201cshe wanted to be able to tell Arizonans that she didn\u2019t raise their taxes.\u201d",
      "In September 2021, Sinema attended a meeting of House and Senate Democrats at the White House to discuss what Biden hoped would be a $2 trillion version of Build Back Better. According to two of the attendees, Biden first asked each of the senators to articulate their concerns. When it was her turn, Sinema demurred, saying she wanted to hear what the House members had to say first.",
      "\u201cWell, if you\u2019re still at $1 trillion,\u201d Biden interjected, \u201cthen you might as well get up and leave.\u201d",

      "Then, seeming to recognize that losing Sinema\u2019s support would ensure defeat, Biden backed down, saying, \u201cPlease sit down.\u201d",
      "Sinema did so. Toward the end of the meeting, she said to the president: \u201cI told you that in confidence. And if that ends up in the press, I\u2019ll know it was someone from this room.\u201d (The White House did not respond to requests for comment.)",
      "The meeting concluded without further rancor. But the president did not direct House Democrats to let the bills be voted on separately. Sinema suspected that the White House was hoping she would relent. \u201cI would never in my life crack under pressure,\u201d Sinema told me. \u201cWhy would they think I\u2019m going to do it?\u201d",
      "She got her way in the end. On Nov. 5, 2021, the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in the House. Ten days later, Biden signed it into law. Sinema, meanwhile, continued to draw the ire of Democrats for opposing Build Back Better. In a rare interview with CNN, she refused to specify what it would take to change her mind, saying only, \u201cI won\u2019t support any legislation that increases burdens on Arizona or American businesses and reduces our ability to compete either globally or domestically.\u201d The legislation lay dormant into the following year.",

A day later, Chris Murphy \u2014 who, after the shocking Sandy Hook school shooting a decade earlier in his state, emerged as the Democrats\u2019 foremost advocate for gun reform \u2014 happened to read that Sinema had paused at an elevator in the Capitol to inform members of the news media that she would like to work with Republicans on the gun issue. The news initially struck Murphy as improbable: Sinema had effectively stopped talking to the Washington press.",
      "Murphy texted her: \u201cAre you serious?\u201d",
      "Sinema responded that she was. Within two hours, Murphy was sitting in her hideaway office in the basement of the Capitol. Later that day, Sinema walked onto the Senate floor and located the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cWho should I work with on guns?\u201d she asked him.",
      "She and McConnell had been friendly for some time, and she met frequently with him during the infrastructure deliberations. Later in 2022, she would go to his state, Kentucky, to speak at the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center, where she was praised by the minority leader as \u201cthe most effective first-term senator I\u2019ve seen in my time in the Senate.\u201d Now, responding to her question on the Senate floor, McConnell replied, \u201cJohn Cornyn and Thom Tillis.\u201d Sinema promptly texted them both. The next day, the two Republican senators and Sinema and Murphy were in her hideaway, devising a legislative framework. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a day when the four of us weren\u2019t talking multiple times,\u201d Tillis told me.",
      "That June, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Against the wishes of the powerful National Rifle Association, an astonishing 14 Senate Republicans voted for the bill, including the minority leader; as Murphy would tell me, \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t pass it without McConnell\u2019s support, and Kyrsten was in ongoing conversations with him.\u201d The bill did not address military-style rifles like the ones used by the Uvalde shooter or extend background checks to internet and gun-show sales, measures that were guaranteed to be blocked by a Republican filibuster. It did, however, provide enhanced penalties for straw purchases, add extra steps to background checks for purchasers who are 18 to 21 and close the so-called boyfriend loophole, which allowed abusive partners to own a gun even with an order of protection against them.",
      "\u201cSenator Sinema stepped up and played a critical role in passing what happened to be the most substantive and lifesaving gun legislation in a generation,\u201d Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, the nation\u2019s most influential gun-control group, told me. Still, though Watts, Murphy and other gun-safety advocates continue to press for a ban on military-style rifles, Sinema told me that she was unlikely to take up the cause. \u201cThe reason is pretty simple,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic. I don\u2019t spend my time in the world of fantasy. I spend my time in the world of the possible.\u201d",
      "Two months after the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was enacted, the path to the possible was found once again: Sinema and the Biden administration had reached a deal on the social-spending bill formerly known as Build Back Better. Now rechristened the Inflation Reduction Act, the initiative would spend roughly $500 billion to fund clean-energy programs and extend the Affordable Care Act. The accord with Sinema broke the deadlock, allowing for swift passage \u2014 and a win for the Biden White House.",
      "Still, progressives were not of the mind to applaud the Arizona senator, who had extracted a significant price in exchange for her support: The bill would no longer be paid for in part by closing the carried-interest loophole, which allowed wealthy private-equity executives to claim much of their compensation as investment gains rather than as taxable income. As reporters were quick to note, Sinema had received over $2 million in campaign donations from the investment sector over the previous decade. (And hundreds of thousands ",
      " was passed.)",
      "Sinema\u2019s rationale for supporting private-equity firms is rooted in the economic growth of Arizona, which, she claims, depends on affordable-housing construction that is underwritten by such firms. \u201cSo to me, it makes no sense to disincentivize the supply side of creating that affordable housing in multifamily units,\u201d Sinema told me.",
      "Her solution was to finance the Inflation Reduction Act by increasing the corporate minimum tax, ensuring that all businesses would pay at least 15 percent. This, Sinema said, made more sense than increasing the overall corporate tax \u2014 \u201cif your goal is tax fairness, which is mine.\u201d",
      "If that was her goal, I asked, then was she actually saying that the carried-interest loophole for the ultrawealthy was fair?",
      "\u201cWhat I think it is,\u201d she said, \u201cis an important tool to incentivize investment.\u201d",
      "An earlier version of Kyrsten Sinema \u2014 for example, the 2012 congressional candidate whose opening campaign ad promised that she would be a voice for \u201cthe powerless\u201d \u2014 would most likely have labeled her argument a defense of \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d It was also a shaky position on its own terms.",
      "I asked Arthur C. Nelson, emeritus professor of urban planning and real estate development at the University of Arizona, whether the carried-interest loophole was crucial to his state\u2019s real estate economy. Nelson sent me a set of numbers showing that the annual population growth rate in the three-decade period before the carried-interest provision was formalized in 1993 was 3.3 percent. In the three decades after the loophole was codified, annual growth was 2.1 percent. Assuming, as Nelson did, that population and real estate investment growth were correlated, then the carried-interest loophole had not spawned a housing boom. \u201cThe logic is nonsense,\u201d he said. Closing the loophole and using the revenue on homeowner and builder subsidies \u201cwould generate more housing than simply reducing taxes.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cIn full disclosure, I indeed benefit from the carried-interest loophole. But I personally oppose it for its lack of fairness. I worry that Senator Sinema\u2019s financial thinking is being led by self-styled \u2018masters of the finance universe,\u2019 instead of the masses who voted for her \u2014 me included.\u201d",
      " there was snow on the ground in the town of Whiteriver on the Fort Apache Reservation in northeastern Arizona, which the senator treaded through gingerly in the same boots she would wear at the border a month later. She was here to meet with members of the White Mountain Apache tribe at their invitation.",
      "For the next hour, Sinema sat in a crowded conference room, asking questions and taking notes as the tribal leaders discussed their need for more housing, more police cars and a jail with a roof that wouldn\u2019t collapse. Other than myself, only a couple of members from the tribal community media were present. Private security accompanied her. (Sinema has received death threats; at one point, her stepbrother, Paul Sheldon, told me, he and Sinema\u2019s father were informed by F.B.I. officials that threats had been made against them as well.)",
      "After hosting a few town halls with constituents during her first two years in the Senate, Sinema had since abandoned the practice, except for regular \u201ctele town halls\u201d on a virtual basis. Events like this one \u2014 small and restricted \u2014 have become the norm. To some friends, her reclusiveness is as inevitable as her break from the Democratic Party. \u201cI\u2019ve never in my life seen someone treated as poorly as they treated Sinema,\u201d the former Democratic congresswoman Kathleen Rice told me. \u201cTo me, it made all the sense in the world that she rejected the label of being a Democrat.\u201d Still, it seems impossible for her to continue to avoid openly engaging with Arizonans and somehow manage to win their votes in 2024.",
      "There was one additional item on the agenda that morning at the Fort Apache Reservation. The tribal leaders wanted to thank Sinema for ensuring that the community had at last gained access to clean drinking water. \u201cI worked with Republicans and Democrats in both chambers in the waning days of December to overcome the obstacles,\u201d Sinema told them. She then singled out three partners, all Republicans: Senators Tillis and Lee, and the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Bruce Westerman.",
      "These efforts have not been previously reported. When it came time to dole out favors in the 2021 infrastructure bill, among Sinema\u2019s requests was that all five Arizona tribes be guaranteed clean water. Tillis told her that he had an issue. He and his fellow North Carolina Republican, Senator Richard Burr, had put a hold on all tribal bills for the past three years. When she asked why they had done so, Tillis explained that the Lumbee tribe of North Carolina had yet to be federally recognized. Sinema pledged to help. \u201cKyrsten became the first legislator to invest time in what we were trying to accomplish for the Lumbees,\u201d Tillis told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why Burr and I agreed to remove the holds.\u201d",
      "Then Sinema learned that Lee, because of his longstanding view that tribal economic development should not require federal approval, had put holds on ",
      " tribal bills. She proceeded to work Lee as well. To Lee\u2019s aide who works on the issue, Sinema described the merits of what were now five individual Arizona tribal water bills. One day in mid-December, she received a text from the Utah senator. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d it said. Lee had pulled the holds.",
      "Finally, Sinema spoke with Westerman, a congressman from Arkansas whom she befriended back when she served in the House. He, too, had concerns: that the bills as written did not provide accounting for the expenditures. Sinema added language that did so. She called Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader for whom she had once been assistant whip, who now agreed to put the bills on the suspension calendar, making them eligible to pass by a voice vote. The amendments to the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act became law on Jan. 5, 2023.",
      "As I watched the tribal leaders present Sinema with an Apache blanket and a ceremonial basket, I remembered her friend Stephanie Murphy saying of her, \u201cI\u2019ve never met a person more focused or strategic.\u201d What was the strategic aim here? I recalled our conversation in February about her being five minutes late because of a driving-distance miscalculation that was immediately remedied. \u201cEverything is like a puzzle,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd so if there\u2019s a problem, we should solve it.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo you approach legislation as a puzzle?\u201d I asked her.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201c",
      ".\u201d She then went on: \u201cI think one of the big problems in negotiations is that often some \u2014 not exclusively men, but often men \u2014 are so busy talking about what they need, they\u2019re not spending any time hearing what someone else needs. But the key to solving a problem is to listen carefully and find out what someone needs and then figure out how to get it for them. If you give them what they need, you can get what you want.\u201d",
      "Was simply delivering clean water to the Apaches what Sinema wanted, or was there some electoral angle on the distant horizon? Maybe she needed Democrats to see her tending to the needs of the \u201cpowerless,\u201d as she had pledged to do when she first ran for Congress in 2011. Maybe an independent like Sinema needed to find votes wherever she could get them. Or perhaps it was satisfying enough simply to solve a puzzle that others couldn\u2019t. Making the system work was her greatest value, Portman told me: \u201cBy resolving disputes over amendments, over nominees, she helps the Senate operate.\u201d",
      "Sinema\u2019s role in the operation of the Senate during one of the most polarized periods in American political history has contributed to a remarkably successful legislative record for Democrats to showcase next year. \u201cHere\u2019s a woman who\u2019s delivered them major victories,\u201d Stephanie Murphy told me, \u201cand they campaign on this, after vilifying her.\u201d",
      "As strange as this eventuality might be, Sinema is not entirely blameless for it. An unnamed Democratic legislator told Politico that Sinema was \u201cthe biggest egomaniac in the Senate,\u201d which, if it were true, would be quite a distinction. None of her admiring colleagues \u2014 including Portman, Tillis and Romney \u2014 would deny Sinema\u2019s high estimation of her own abilities. But they described her to me as a uniquely skilled workhorse who deserved at least as much credit as she had been given, if not more. \u201cEveryone\u2019s out there campaigning on what she and a few of us did,\u201d Representative Scott Peters, a Democratic moderate from California and an ally of Sinema\u2019s, told me, referring to her stewardship of the infrastructure bill. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me, sort of funny in a way. I guess the legislation has to be its own reward sometimes.\u201d",
      "Peters entered Congress with Sinema in 2013. Together they worked on bills ranging from wildfire prevention to mental health care for veterans. He remembered meeting her at a restaurant, where he found her poring over a spreadsheet that was color-coded with infrastructure revenue options. It saddened him to think about her leaving the Democratic Party. When I asked Peters whether he would support her or Ruben Gallego in 2024, he paused before saying: \u201cIt may be awkward. I\u2019ll just say that Kyrsten Sinema has been my friend, and if she asked for my support, it would be hard to turn her down.\u201d",
      "He laughed ruefully. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to find friends in D.C. Just ask Kyrsten.\u201d",

      "In March, on Day 7 of the ",
      ", after the court spectacle had already been branded everything from a \u201cmeme machine\u201d to \u201cthe whitest trial of all time,\u201d the retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sat in the witness box, somewhat deflated already. By that point, he probably knew that his pursuit of Paltrow for damages connected to a ski collision he said was her fault was a pretty bad idea. Sanderson claimed that injuries he sustained during the 2016 ski crash (including, notably, a concussion) changed his life, turning him into \u201ca different person,\u201d and \u201ca crippled vet.\u201d Paltrow\u2019s lawyer, the languid, unflappably stone-eyed Stephen Owens, stood before him, presenting Facebook posts \u2014 a lot of Facebook posts, some taken months after the collision \u2014 as evidence of robust health.",
      "\u201cThis is a picture of you and your girlfriend, smiling big, right?\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile, camera, yup,\u201d Sanderson replied.",
      "And then, the deluge:",
      "Was this, Owens asked, Sanderson hiking with his girlfriend? Was this him taking a picture of a moose? Was this him, looking happy? Was this him hiking again, and smiling? With a cool backpack containing water? Scuba diving? At an auto show in Germany? A shooting range? BMX bike show? Was this Sanderson on a boat ride along canals in the Netherlands? Did he do bus tours? Or go to Morocco? Twice? Did he go to the this museum in Marrakesh? Was this him at a rock concert? At a ski resort? Out with drinking buddies? At an exhibit? Feeling happy? Looking fit and happy? Was this him \u201cdoing yoga, or momba, or what?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Zumba,\u201d Sanderson corrected. And yes.",
      "As far as controversies go, the trial was as Diamond Life as you can get. For about a week, it lived in the media as a jaunty low-stakes holiday from the high-stakes everything of our ongoing ",
      " Amid a news cycle of war and school shootings, recession and an indicted former president, it was an almost-delightful diversion to have this little legal whodunit, this simple question of who crashed into whom on a resort ski slope so luxurious it might as well be covered in cashmere.",
      "As much of a trifle as the trial was for viewers, it seemed to be a real inconvenience for Paltrow, who said she was injured by Sanderson and infamously claimed to have \u201clost half a day of skiing\u201d as a result of the crash. Sanderson seems to me like an opportunist with an appetite for attention, or at the very least a schlemiel, possibly a little vain. The retired optometrist, the jury made clear, crashed into Paltrow, making him the offender. Unsurprisingly, ",
      "But what frustrated me in this trial, particularly in the questioning above, was that Sanderson\u2019s claim that his life was changed by the concussion was over and over again challenged or dismissed. Part of the reason for this assertion seemed to stem from the fact that, well, he seemed to still have a life. Owens heavily implied that a man truly affected by a mild traumatic brain injury like a concussion couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t go hiking, or travel, or make it look on Facebook as if he were living the dream. Or maybe the frame of reasoning was more that somebody living with illness \u2014 in Sanderson\u2019s case an invisible illness \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be doing those things. He should be in bed, in the land of the sick, no visa, no passport.",
      "The category of invisible illness \u2014 which means exactly what it sounds like: an illness or disability not immediately apparent \u2014 is growing sharply in America. Through the wonders of medicine we\u2019ve become great at turning life-or-death illnesses, like diabetes, heart conditions or certain forms of cancer, into chronic conditions that can often be lived with. At the same time, diagnoses of hidden diseases like Crohn\u2019s or fibromyalgia are becoming increasingly common \u2014 as is long Covid, which on its own might have affected as many as 23 million Americans.",
      "Sanderson is really not a representative whom anybody living with invisible illness wants: a person who could very likely be exaggerating or appropriating symptoms for gain; a man who identifies as a victim diminished by injury and then goes scuba-diving and sits beaming like a prince on a Moroccan camel. As far as advocacy goes, it\u2019s not the best look.",
      "Yet as someone who has, for nearly the past 20 years, lived with invisible illness, I can tell you that it is a legitimate look. My personal complex of illness stems from an unusual neurological condition called spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome, which leads to a brain with an insufficient cushion around it. I also have post-concussion syndrome. In my own decades with sickness as a varyingly close companion, there have been many points at which my life was truly defined by pain and disability on the inside, but still looked pretty nice and zippy on paper (or Facebook). I had two kids, I moved cities, I traveled, I hosted events, I wrote books and articles, I got out of a marriage that wasn\u2019t working, I had boyfriends. Sometimes I did some of these things very slowly, as if from the middle of a lake of glue. Sometimes I did them white-knuckled, with a brain that felt like a fat, broiling whale bladder. Other times I was more fine \u2014 like now \u2014 and if someone were to encounter me on the street, they might assume I was 100 percent cured.",
      "What I am describing here is the between-space spectrum of functional illness, a zone occupied by many with invisible illnesses \u2014 with feet both in the world of the well and in the universe of the sick. The sociologist Arthur W. Frank has called this cohort \u201cremission society.\u201d But I prefer to think of it as a society of walking wounded, because the term better includes people affected by illnesses including lupus, Lyme disease, migraine, endometriosis and, yes, the stubborn remnants of concussion \u2014 all of which are more chronically pooh-poohed, disbelieved or gaslighted, not least by the medical community.",
      "Oddly, it\u2019s a realm Paltrow says she herself inhabits. Just a few days before the trial began, the actor and ",
      " in which she seemed to suggest that her normal daily food intake was composed of coffee, bone broth and vegetables \u2014 a therapeutic diet she says has been helping her get over her own symptoms of long Covid and other health issues. (Paltrow later clarified that she eats \u201cfull meals.\u201d) But the interview, which might have been strategically given to position Paltrow as a sick person who got uncomplainingly ill and then took care of her own business through an anti-inflammatory diet and a stiff upper lip (rather than blame and the courts), backfired: \u200bNot only did it make Paltrow look disordered and out of touch; it also put her own health issues into the same quotation marks as Sanderson\u2019s. An illness invisible, and thus relentlessly questioned.",
      "So, I don\u2019t believe that Sanderson is a victim of reckless Hollywood royalty on skis. But I do believe his brain injury. Because I know, intimately, what a brain injury can do. And I know that between illness and health, there really is no zero-\u200bsum game. A man can have a life forever altered by a concussion. And he can also Zumba.",

      "Perhaps with no clearer motive than F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s observation that \u201cFrance has the only two things toward which we drift as we grow older \u2014 intelligence and good manners,\u201d we packed up our possessions during the last dark days of one December and decided to move to Paris. It was pleasant, I had often been told, for a writer to live somewhere where reading and writing were accorded the highest respect, and it was true that \u2014 in Paris at least \u2014 these were semipublic activities: In every park and cafe, on the Metro and on the benches along the Seine, people were openly engaged in what for me had always been the most private and solitary of occupations. Bookstores still held their ground here among the shopfronts, and the deification of French writers living and dead was evinced everywhere in street names and statues and advertising hoardings for new novels. I listened on the radio to an astronaut reading passages aloud from Marguerite Duras from his space station to his earthbound audience below.",
      "Then, last October, the writer ",
      ", the first Frenchwoman ever to do so. We had been in France for nearly two years, and amid the alternating sensations of regeneration and disarray that this upheaval had inevitably incurred, Annie Ernaux had come to represent for me a troubling point of constancy. During my initial months in Paris, when it seemed for the first time in my life that lying on a sofa reading a book was something I was not only permitted but encouraged to do, I made my way slowly in my clumsy French through one slim text after another: ",
      " ",
      " ",
      " \u201cThe Possession,\u201d \u201cThe Years.\u201d The story they told, rigorously excluding anything that did not directly pertain to it, was that of Annie Duschene (Ernaux\u2019s maiden name), only child of a working-class French couple who ran a humble ",
      " in Yvetot, a small town in Normandy.",
      "By means of scholarly excellence, Annie claws her way out of the mire of her origins to teacher-training college, marries the first man who presents himself, is submerged in a bourgeois purgatory as housewife and mother and slowly breaks her way out of that new prison by writing books \u2014 books that try to stop time by questioning and reconstructing as precisely as they can the events that have brought her to the existence she is now leading. Who is she, and where has she come from? Who were her parents, and why did they live as they did? Why did she act in certain ways as she became free of them, and to what degree is her life the consequence of those actions? Has she ever lived consciously even for one minute, or is this task of writing and reconstruction the effort to apply consciousness to blind fate?",
      "Despite the differences \u2014 of nationality, generation, social class, familial situation \u2014 between my own life and that of Annie Ernaux, I found myself plunged as I read into a more and more profound state of recognition. Yet what I seemed to be recognizing were things that no one generally admits. Ernaux\u2019s honesty had the effect of illuminating a profound and unsuspected lack of freedom in her reader. How, through the simple story of her origins, had she laid her hand so surely on the human tragedy of our ability to make ourselves unfree? The answer perhaps lay in her faith in writing as a sacred and transcendent activity. She believed in writing as some people believe in religion, as a sphere where the self, the soul, is entitled to find refuge.",
      "Who she was as a writer bore only one very specific relationship to who she was as a woman: They inhabited the same body. It was to this body that she was confined, actually and artistically \u2014 to its social and economic destiny, to its gendered limitations, to its geographical and temporal location. What had happened to and in this body, what it in turn had made happen in the years from its birth to the present moment, was the limit and extent of her material.",
      "France being a nation that holds itself in high esteem for its literary culture, the Nobel news caused a feverish outburst of pride, but also some startling paroxysms of venom. How could a woman who wrote only about herself be awarded the literary world\u2019s highest accolade? Madame Ovary, as she was called by one conservative French critic, was the prime example of the erosion of literary art by narratives of self-pity and marginalization. The intelligence \u2014 indeed the sanity \u2014 of the Nobel committee appeared to be questioned. It was explained to me that in France the exposure of unglamorous aspects of female reality \u2014 the complaints of the ",
      ", or housewife \u2014 was widely considered to be distasteful. There was also apparently the matter of jealousy \u2014 of Ernaux\u2019s success, of the youthfulness of her readership and now of this greatest of honors \u2014 among the literary male old guard. Yet it seemed to me that such explanations were, in fact, unnecessary: The aggression was simply the evidence that the nerve of truth had been touched.",
      "From the beginning of her 50-year career, the uncompromising candor of Ernaux\u2019s voice has wielded a formidable power of shock: the lacerating portrait of motherhood and bourgeois family life in \u201cA Frozen Woman\u201d; the masterly, pitiless accounts of her parents\u2019 lives and deaths \u2014 and therefore of poor, provincial France \u2014 in \u201cA Man\u2019s Place\u201d and \u201cA Woman\u2019s Story\u201d; her analysis of the extreme subjection at the core of sexual relationships in \u201cSimple Passion\u201d and \u201cThe Possession.\u201d One after another, her works have alienated or dismayed diverse groups across the social and political spectrum, from cultural patriarchs to feminists. It might seem evident that shock is the signifier of truth and reveals more about the people who feel it than about the artistic objectivity that caused it, but in the case of Annie Ernaux, the usual operation of time in reconciling people to truth did not seem entirely to have occurred.",
      "\u201cThis summer, for the first time, I watched a pornographic film,\u201d she writes at the opening of \u201cSimple Passion.\u201d She continues:",
      "\u201cThe story was incomprehensible; it was impossible to predict any of the actions or movements. The man walked up to the woman. There was a close-up of the woman\u2019s genitals, clearly visible among the shimmerings of the screen, then of the man\u2019s penis, fully erect, sliding into the woman\u2019s vagina. For a long time this coming and going of the two sex organs was shown from several angles. ... No doubt one gets used to such a sight; the first time is shattering. Centuries and centuries, hundreds of generations have gone by and it is only now that one can see this \u2014 a man\u2019s penis and a woman\u2019s vagina coming together \u2014 something one could barely take in without dying has become as easy to watch as a handshake. It occurred to me that writing should also aim for that \u2014 the impression conveyed by sexual intercourse, the feeling of anxiety and awe, a suspension of moral judgment.\u201d",
      " books one after another was like watching an edifice being built in real time, something raised out of the wet ground and constructed brick by brick. The harrowing beauty and brevity of these books and their apparent simplicity disguised somewhat the punishing cost of their honesty. Never had I seen the supposed freedom \u2014 the \u201cnarcissism,\u201d as we now like to call it \u2014 of self-examination so exposed in its brutality. Ernaux grasped the depths of isolation and loss she would need to descend to in order to retrieve the original reality of her being. Her art bears no relation to a privileging of personal experience; on the contrary, it is almost a self-violation. What Annie Ernaux understood was that as a female child of the regional laboring classes, her self was her only authentic possession in this world, and thus the sole basis for the legitimacy of her art.",
      "Lying on the sofa, I became slowly immured in the concrete reality of this edifice and of its facts. The girl Annie grows up in an environment of squalor and industry. She is an only child, an older sister having died of diphtheria at age 6. Her father runs the cafe while her mother manages the shop, the two spaces connected by a corridor that functions as the family\u2019s kitchen. There is no bathroom, just a toilet for customers and family alike out in the yard.",
      "Over time, her reality takes shape around certain foundations, the mother and father most evidently, and the cramped labyrinth of the cafe and shop with its simple living quarters above \u2014 a world without privacy or solitude, a world in which the observer is as exposed as the observed \u2014 but also around her own nascent exceptionality, which soon becomes the subject of her parents\u2019 mingled terror and pride. She begins early on to perform outstandingly at school. It is clear she will go out into the world, but what world is it, and how and to what end will she survive there? Their social conservatism and Catholicism \u2014 immovable features of the provincial working-class landscape in which they live \u2014 leave the subject of her burgeoning femininity and sexuality entirely opaque. Were she a normal girl, she would marry young with her virginity intact. This scholarly future is a vaguely nunlike destiny, whose risks of ruination include the possibility that \u2014 as a clever oddity \u2014 she might never find a husband. Yet her parents, and especially her mother, don\u2019t want her to be like them, economically and socially trapped in a cycle of incessant labor. At school, she quickly becomes aware of her inferiority, but \u201cat home, on her own territory, the grocer\u2019s girl \u2014 as the locals call her \u2014 has all the rights. Helping herself liberally to packets of sweets and boxes of cookies, lying reading in bed until midday during the holidays, never setting the table or cleaning her shoes. She lives and behaves like a queen.\u201d (I have translated this passage, and the others quoted in this article, from the French.) Her mother\u2019s one luxury is reading, a habit Annie acquires from her.",
      "At once cosseted and imprisoned by her parents, burdened with the prospect of her own liberation from everything she knows, the girl tries to contain in herself the violent forces of ignorance and desire, the problem of owing everything to people who can teach her nothing, the growing discomfort of her origins that is matched by the mystery of how one could live differently. Though she doesn\u2019t know it, her isolation \u2014 the only tangible result, in fact, of her exceptionality \u2014 is extreme. This exceptionality is the great subject and problem of Annie Ernaux\u2019s oeuvre, the Other with which she spars in book after book, sometimes taking the form of guilt or shame, in others of a savage and dizzying freedom. The exceptionality strives to normalize itself at every turn by making her conform, often to things that directly clash with and contradict one another. The conforming, sooner or later, results in rebellion: She is trapped and frees herself, creates and destroys and survives, learning over and over by this arduous and often disastrous route the opposing facts of internal and external reality. The exceptionality is not, in fact, that of intellectual or physical or moral attributes. It is the exceptionality of the artist, of the person who lives to tell the tale.",
      "In 1958, at age 18, she is given the opportunity to work for a month as one of a group of monitors at a children\u2019s summer camp in S, a village in the Orne. With this first experience of liberty, the whole unfeasible powder keg of her identity explodes. \u201cThe list of her social ignorances would be interminable,\u201d Ernaux writes of herself in \u201cA Girl\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to use a telephone, has never taken either a shower or a bath. She has no experience of any milieu but her own.\u201d In the middle-class world of the summer camp, she is by turns gauche and outrageous, short on manners, taste, charm and savoir-faire \u2014 she is, in a word, unacceptable. She alienates both her peers and her superiors, acquires a reputation for sexual availability and even lacks the discrimination to recognize what has happened. Yet she knows too that she is, for those people, entirely forgettable.",
      "\u201cI too wanted to forget that girl,\u201d Ernaux writes. \u201cTo forget her truly, meaning to have no desire to write about her. Never again to think that I ought to write about her, her desire, her folly, her idiocy and her pride. ... [Yet] there were always phrases in my journal, allusions to \u2018the girl of S,\u2019 \u2018the girl of 58.\u2019 For 20 years I have listed \u201858\u2019 among my book projects. It is always the missing text. Always delayed. The unquantifiable hole.\u201d",
      "During those weeks at the summer camp, she quietly abandons, without quite realizing it, her academic ambitions. She adjusts her expectations: Instead of going to a prestigious university, she will train to become a primary-school teacher. The weeks of summer camp, which at the time she believed to be the threshold of the future, were in fact a turning point back into the past. She would have to account for every moment of that past, both personally and artistically. What she had been programmed to escape was to become, in a very different form, her destiny.",
      "Sometimes, reading, I would experience the curious illusion that this 82-year-old laureate was not my elder but my junior \u2014 that her voice was speaking from a future in which the possibilities for female utterance were bolder, more serious, more liberal. I was as though chagrined by my own compromised femininity in the light of this more evolved future. How had she managed to be so daring, so candid, so autonomous \u2014 so free?",
      "The answer, perhaps, was shame: What Ernaux seemed to have understood from the start is that shame is the obverse side of truth. She uses it as a map, the existence of shame at different points in her history unfailingly leading her to a concealment of self buried beneath it. Besides, shame has an excellent memory, \u201cmore detailed, more indelible than any other. Memory ... is the special gift of shame.\u201d",
      "It was, perhaps, her shame about her origins that resulted in \u201cA Man\u2019s Place,\u201d the book that first cemented her place in French literary culture. Her voice, so unlike any other, told the story of a France that did not usually presume to express itself. Spare, methodical, relentless, shocking \u2014 \u201cclinical\u201d was the word chosen by the Nobel committee \u2014 the severity of its discipline was matched by its unrepentant liberty. This, then, was the strange fruit of the ",

      "arrival in Paris, wanting to improve my French, I was put in touch with a writer who wanted to improve her English, and we began to meet weekly for conversations that switched language at midpoint, like a soccer team changing ends at halftime. The writer was Delphine de Vigan, a novelist around my own age, like me the mother of two grown-up children who is no longer with their father.",
      "At first we were a little shy, a shyness that seemed to spring from our joint practicality. To be taking time in the middle of the afternoon simply to converse was a luxury to which neither of us seemed to feel altogether entitled. We had each been the wage-earners and managers in our households; each of us for years had written in extremis around the interruptions and ",
      "; each of us had the greatest difficulty in considering ourselves to be artists; yet we each, despite or perhaps because of the exigency of our writing conditions, had chosen the hazardous route of self-examination in pursuit of a somehow ineluctable truth, the truth of who we were in the world and why.",
      "Delphine de Vigan\u2019s first novel, \u201cDays Without Hunger,\u201d was an account of her near-death from anorexia as a young woman, but in the novels that followed she moved determinedly away from autobiographical material, so that that first slim and agonized text remained there like an unanswered question. What had driven her \u2014 what drives anyone \u2014 to starve herself to the point of extinction at the very moment of gaining autonomy? This particularly female form of self-attack seemed to delineate something, a corresponding shadow or a silence, lying centrally across the field of self-expression.",
      "I, too, at certain points, had felt at risk of becoming fundamentally separated from my own material, when my biological life as a woman began to generate conditions and experiences that were alien to and inadmissible in the writing of fiction. How was I to approach as a subject something whose power of nullification was so great that it menaced the very act of representation? To write about motherhood for instance \u2014 to bring objective scrutiny and distance to the biological invasion of the self \u2014 seemed to be not only a practical but also an intellectual impossibility. In order to succeed as an artist \u2014 it seemed \u2014 both the inconvenience and thus the reality of femininity had to be scrupulously concealed.",
      "\u201cMy mother was blue, a pale ash-blue, the hands strangely darker than the face, when I found her at her house that January morning,\u201d begins de Vigan\u2019s riveting 2011 memoir, ",
      " \u201cThe hands as though stained with ink, at the folds of the knuckles. She had been dead for several days. I don\u2019t know how many seconds or even minutes it took me to understand this, despite the evidence in front of me \u2014 a long time, awkward and febrile, until a cry escaped my lungs. Even today, more than two years later, it remains for me a mystery: By what mechanism was my brain able to hold itself apart from the sight of my mother\u2019s corpse, and most of all from its smell, how had it taken so much time to accept the information that was in front of it? It was not the only question that her death left me with.\u201d",
      "With this book, de Vigan spectacularly marked the end of her self-annexation, or rather the point at which the internal pressure of truth forced its content out into the world. Her mother\u2019s suicide was a sort of refusal or breakdown of the female narrative. To comprehend it, every aspect of de Vigan\u2019s reality had to be dismantled: the entire carapace of self, of history both personal and impersonal, of memory and fact and myth, of the collective life and the individual reality, and most of all of writing \u2014 narration \u2014 and its relationship to being. The book is not so much a reconstruction of her mother\u2019s life as a gathering of evidence, by which the private and subjective is made public and accountable. It required a painstaking examination of her wider family \u2014 a formidable and traditionally French clan of aunts and uncles and grandparents \u2014 and therefore of family culture itself. The resulting book is an inquiry into the \u201creality\u201d a child is born into, a domain tyrannized by authority structures and social codes in which the personal binds fatally with the authorized and communal to make a theater of blood relationships.",
      "\u201cTo write about one\u2019s family,\u201d de Vigan writes, \u201cis without doubt the surest means of falling out with them.\u201d Throughout her narration, she remains terrified and tormented by her power of disclosure, like a child being handed a dangerous weapon. She reveals, among other things, that her mother claimed to have been raped by her own father as a teenager, an accusation the mother made in writing at 32, sending the text to every member of her family. No one ever mentioned it: Life continued as normal, the family meeting regularly for Sunday lunch at the grandparents\u2019 country house.",
      "Midway through the book, rived with anxiety about the secrets she is revealing, de Vigan recounts a dream in which such a gathering of the long-dead is occurring. \u201cEveryone is there, nothing has changed: the collection of porcelain plates on the wall, the serving baskets placed here and there around the table, the smell of roast lamb drifting in the air.\u201d As the food is being served, a silence suddenly falls, and her dead grandmother turns to her, \u201cwith that sorrowful or disappointed expression that sometimes alters her gaze, without hostility. \u2018It isn\u2019t nice what you\u2019re doing, darling,\u2019 she says. \u2018It isn\u2019t nice.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing Holds Back the Night\u201d was published in France to a wave of recognition, selling a million copies and winning numerous prizes. In this literature-loving country, Delphine de Vigan became a modest sort of rock star, yet the aims of her book were in a sense challenging or undermining the tenets of that culture and the story it told about itself. Among other things, what de Vigan \u2014 and the powerful response of her public \u2014 testified to was the personal cost exacted by life in this exalted, beautiful yet patriarchal nation. Her book is a girl\u2019s story, her own girlhood as well as that of her mother, yet she finds that there is no template for it. Her mother\u2019s pain \u201cwas part of our childhood, and later of our lives as adults,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout doubt her pain formed us, my sister and me. Yet any attempt at explanation is bound to fail. Instead I must make do with a writing made of odds and ends, of fragments, of hypotheses.\u201d",

      " a weekly 90-minute television show about books, had often been cited to me as the emblem of France\u2019s exceptional relationship to literary culture. Once a week, the country sat down to watch a special-effects-free sequence of interviews and debates with the writers of the moment. The prestige and sales figures of these writers were considerably advanced by an appearance on \u201cLa Grande Librairie\u201d \u2014 an invitation was among the most fiercely desired laurels for the contemporary French writer. It was unusual, I had been told, for a foreign or non-French-speaking author to be invited; the need for an interpreter slowed things down too much.",
      "On the phone, I explained that my French was not good enough to accept the invitation. There was silence on the other end \u2014 evidently no one refused such an offer; it simply wasn\u2019t possible. What wasn\u2019t possible, I continued, was that I would speak French on national television when I was still capable of making basic errors ordering a baguette in a ",
      ". It was explained to me that not only would I do so, I would do so very well. A special edition of the program had been put together for Annie Ernaux: The author herself would be there. My appearance would be a nice surprise for her, and besides, they needed someone to give the international perspective.",
      "The near-hysterical national pride one might have anticipated at the Nobel accolade had, it seemed, been accompanied by some self-reproach. There was a general feeling that Annie Ernaux had somehow escaped appreciation, had been denied justice in her own country. Despite the French reverence for literature, it had required non-French eyes to see her true worth. The Anglophone world, for instance, had long understood her importance \u2014 it was seemingly as a witness to this debatable notion that I was invited to participate in the special edition of \u201cLa Grande Librairie.\u201d",
      "I went to ask Delphine de Vigan\u2019s advice, but she, too, seemed to be inhabiting this other reality, in which I could discuss literary matters in French before an audience of a million people. You\u2019ll be fine, she said. She offered to help me practice. Afterward we sat and talked about writing, about the blankness and terror that sometimes overcome each of us at the idea of having to write another book, as though it were some awful duty. Would either of us write again, if we had sufficient means not to? It seemed to me that for each of us it was this binding of writing with practicality \u2014 which for years had lent legitimacy to an apparently impractical activity \u2014 that now darkened the prospect of exercising our craft. I felt sure that neither of us knew any greater joy than that of doing our work, yet the framing of it as a job rather than art had become habitual.",
      "After the startling success of \u201cNothing Holds Back the Night,\u201d Delphine de Vigan wrote a clever, tenebrous faux-memoir called ",
      " in which the splitting of herself, first by writing the book about her mother and then by the extraordinary fame it brought her, is incarnated in a woman she meets at a party who insinuates herself into her life and nearly destroys it. While writing this book, she felt, she says now, the most crippling self-consciousness and anxiety, as though a goblin critic were sitting on her shoulder laughing cruelly at every line she set down. She was certain it was a failure and nearly didn\u2019t publish it at all: It was a huge success and won the prestigious Prix Renaudot, as well as the Prix Goncourt des Lyc\u00e9ens.",
      "This fear of writing, which is not perhaps a fear of failure so much as a deep and half-unconscious belief that writing is socially and morally wrong, seemed to me to be the very reverse of Annie Ernaux\u2019s vocational objectivity. \u201cIt is the absence of a sense of what one is living at the moment one lives it that multiplies the possibilities of writing,\u201d Ernaux writes in \u201cA Girl\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cTo explore the gulf between the frightening reality of what happens, at the moment it happens, and the strange unreality, years later, of what happened.\u201d",
      "On the set of \u201cLa Grande Librairie,\u201d amid the cameras and wires and blinding lights, where an atmosphere of sustained nervous frenzy was running through everything like an electric charge, Annie Ernaux was sitting among the other participants on a plush sofa \u2014 small and still and composed, like a statue depicting sanity. It was before the eyes of this sanity, rather than those of x million French people, that I would consider myself to be judged.",
      "For me, the conversation was like a ball being thrown very fast from one participant to another. I could understand very little of what was being said: My strategy had been to learn by heart a number of all-purpose lines, which I delivered every time the direction of the others\u2019 eyes indicated the ball was being thrown to me. Afterward I was ready to faint. The producer and presenter congratulated me. You see? they said. We told you it would be fine!",
      "There was a small drinks reception for us all downstairs, and I was surprised to see Ernaux, proud and elegant, standing there alone, away from the talking groups. Her solitude and apartness seemed like things she carried with her wherever she went. I approached her and said hello, and she took my hand and patted it. Hers was soft and warm. Her eyes were like searchlights. We stood there, our hands clasped together. I would be very glad, she said after a while, if in a week\u2019s time everyone could forget this had ever happened.",
      "Delphine de Vigan and I drove out to Cergy, where Ernaux lives. It is the suburb she describes in \u201cThe Years,\u201d the 2008 novel that finally carried her reputation outside France. \u201cThe Years\u201d is a longer and more ambitious book than its predecessors: The familiar facts of Ernaux\u2019s life are there, but this time they are integrated into a broader context of social history, political and cultural events, and most of all the advance of capitalism into every aspect of life in the second half of the 20th century. For the first time Ernaux sees herself not as the anomaly from Yvetot but as part of the wave of history, a gendered organism shaped and driven by forces both seen and unseen, forces whose operation around individual consciousness and destiny has been far more powerful and fundamental than the myth of self-will and personality would seem to allow.",
      "The Oise River, seen from the rise behind Ernaux\u2019s house, winds shining through the valley below among groves of bare trees. It is a square, somber house in a large, sloping garden: Its broad and unimpeded view of the river is startling. Along the lanes and cul-de-sacs we passed on the way the houses are closely packed, their territories demarcated with walls and hedges and security gates that block one another\u2019s line of sight and leave no space empty. Ernaux\u2019s ample shaggy lawn and trailing trees giving way to a wide perspective of sky and valley seem the fruits not of privilege but of artistic and moral consistency: She has lived in this house for 40 years, during which time the world has filled in all the space around her.",
      "Standing outside her front door, I was conscious that we were in one of her literary sites, the home that was the stage set for the woman she became, burning with oppression and desire and her indefatigable power of truth. \u201cFrom September last year, I did nothing else but wait for a man,\u201d she writes in \u201cSimple Passion,\u201d the story of her midlife affair with a married Eastern European diplomat. \u201cFor him to call me and come round to my place ... I had no future other than the telephone call fixing our next appointment. I would try to leave the house as little as possible, except for professional reasons . . . forever fearing that he might call in my absence. I would also avoid using the vacuum cleaner or the hair dryer as they would have prevented me from hearing the sound of the telephone. Every time it rang, I was consumed with hope, which usually only lasted the time it took me slowly to pick up the receiver and say hello. When I realized it wasn\u2019t him, I felt so utterly dejected that I began to loathe the person who was on the line.\u201d",
      "Ernaux was widely upbraided by her feminist readers for this portrayal of female dependency on male sexual attention: The clinical spotlight of her regard, so revelatory when it illuminates that which one is willing to see, becomes distinctly uncomfortable when it falls too close to home. Those same readers may later have found themselves forced to salute her for \u201cThe Young Man,\u201d her account of her relationship in her late 50s with a man 30 years her junior. She describes encountering, when out with the young man in public places, \u201cthe looks of heavy disapproval from people around us. Looks which, far from causing me to feel shame, reinforced my determination not to hide my liaison with a man \u2018young enough to be my son,\u2019 when any man in his 50s could be seen with a girl who was evidently not his daughter without arousing the slightest reprobation.\u201d",
      "She answered the door, beaming with welcome. Inside the house was filled with cold, clear light. It was uncluttered and tidy, modestly and tastefully furnished with antiques, yet it was evident that very little had changed here: The small, spare kitchen where she prepared coffee for us was a kitchen from 40 years ago. Yet the house seemed expressive of a double achievement: her rise from the ",
      " and her stoical resistance of the temptation to falsify or adorn the facts that surround her. We sat at the table in the sunny dining room. She talked about the imminent Nobel Prize ceremony, for which she needed to travel to Stockholm. Her main concern was her descent, before the audience, of a long staircase: At 82, she was worried she\u2019d fall over. We asked whether someone couldn\u2019t accompany her down, and she instantly looked startled. Later, I realized that this well-meaning suggestion was rather tactless: Her autonomy, her uncompromising independence from everyone and everything she has met with in life, was the reason she was going to Stockholm in the first place.",
      "When she talked about her age, and the handful of years she imagines are left to her, the luminosity of her countenance was arresting, and I was struck by the sheer aliveness of this creature and by her undimmed force of inquiry. The question, she said, is how to live when life is nearly over. What, in that context, can life mean? A few months earlier, she and her son David made a documentary, \u201cLes Ann\u00e9es Super 8,\u201d that is a collage of the home movies of their family life shot by her then-husband, Philippe, from 1972 to 1981. The images, so indelibly dated, put the past into a long and almost unbearable perspective. Talking now about the film, and about the clarity with which it summons back her past selves as a young wife and mother, she recalled the secret life that the images did not show: her determination, amid the detritus and preoccupations of conventional family life, to record her inner world in writing.",
      "She wrote her first novel, \u201cCleaned Out,\u201d in secret and mailed it to a publisher in Paris, giving only the address of the school where she was teaching at the time. She didn\u2019t even enclose a cover letter. The weeks during which she waited for a response were filled with the weighty sense of what she had done. Talking about it now, all these years later, she even recalled the dates: of the mailing of the parcel, of the stages of the wait \u2014 fevered expectation followed by doubt followed by the beginnings of resignation \u2014 and of the receipt finally of the letter of acceptance. When the news came, she realized that this was not to be a covert contract with the world, of news smuggled out of her domestic entrapment in an envelope \u2014 the people who knew her, most of all her husband and mother, would also read it. She feared her husband\u2019s reaction, sure enough, to this written betrayal of their shared life, but it was, she says now, her mother\u2019s response to the book that was in fact the only one that mattered to her.",
      "Her mother had come to live with them after her father\u2019s death, and she took the book with her into her bedroom and closed the door. Ernaux recalls going to that door several times during the night and seeing the light still burning through the crack. In the morning, her mother came down to breakfast and didn\u2019t say a word about what she had read, a silence that signaled her acceptance of the situation. It is extraordinary that this tough and humble woman, whose existence had been led under the severest constraints of a reality in which the breaking of social codes could have catastrophic consequences, could approve her daughter\u2019s actions in publicly smashing the bourgeois veneer of her family life.",
      "Proud as her mother was, Ernaux says now, of her daughter\u2019s achievement in securing for herself the undreamed-of accouterments of a conventional middle-class existence, she was prouder of her writing. In the past, on discovering them, she had burned Ernaux\u2019s diaries and notebooks, doubtless out of terror at what their content implied for her daughter\u2019s future. But in the official acceptance by a publisher she recognized legitimacy.",
      "In the bright, tranquil silence of Ernaux\u2019s dining room, I was struck by the force and meaning of this story, the power that a mother\u2019s acceptance could bestow on a woman artist, arming her against the whole world. After an hour or so, we took our leave. In the car on the way home, de Vigan and I spoke about the palpable and forceful aura that emanates from Ernaux and her home, an aura of unbreakable and radiant autonomy. It is rare, we agreed, to encounter someone of such strength. De Vigan wondered whether it was her survival over the years of the attacks on her work and persona \u2014 beginning, to my mind, with the dismay of her husband, who, unlike her mother, could not surmount his embarrassment from her manuscript \u2014 that have fortified her. I disagreed: It was, in my opinion, the fruit of love. From the beginning, her parents believed in her fiercely, passionately, as the most important thing in the world. The fact that they were the owners of a provincial corner store makes no difference.",
      "It is something neither of us had, I said, this unbreakable gift of love, the mother-love that extends even to forgiving the betrayal that is writing. Her own mother, de Vigan said, tried her best to be supportive of her work but was very hurt and embarrassed by the portrayal of the mother in \u201cDays Without Hunger.\u201d It is, I surmised, the reason each of us have struggled to contain the splintering of our creative energies around personal truth, this elemental fear of disapproval, rejection, abandonment \u2014 the grandmother\u2019s suggestion that what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t very nice.",
      " that the venom directed toward Annie Ernaux on social media after her Nobel win had become so uncontrolled that it was the subject of an editorial in L\u2019Obs, the French news weekly. When I next saw de Vigan, she was bewildered and upset by such hatred \u2014 where did it come from, and why? She admitted she had been slow to recognize the flourishing problem of misogyny in today\u2019s world \u2014 like me, she belongs to a generation who grew up believing that feminism had somehow already occurred, that the concepts of social justice and equality were as subject to progress as the evolution of science and technology. Yet if it seems that in our time we have discovered new ways of hating, this belief in the illusion of progress may be the cause. Misogyny, the oldest hatred of them all, plays cat and mouse with this illusion from one generation to the next, to the extent that the experience of misogyny, both private and public, could be said almost to have become a subjective state. If it remains difficult for women to make art about their own lives, it is because femininity still has no stable place in culture. Ernaux recognized and weaponized, as it were, the enforced subjectivity of the female voice. Her mechanism of honesty is highly trustworthy \u2014 but honesty, like certain talents, isn\u2019t heritable by the next generation.",
      "In the days that followed, I thought often of Annie Ernaux in Stockholm, descending the staircase alone. Her body, that which has been both her container and her subject, which has been the fragile, mortal basis of her empire, stepping forward into empty space.",

      "Joel Readence fell in love with the house first.",
      "In May 2021, Mr. Readence, 51, and his partner, Matt Berdine, 46, a sourcing manager for a clothing manufacturer, paid $407,000 for an artfully renovated, three-bedroom antique house with Hudson River views in the Greene County town of Coxsackie, N.Y.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t find Coxsackie \u2014 I found the house,\u201d said Mr. Readence, an executive coach for a large consulting firm, who now splits his time between Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Coxsackie. \u201cAfter sheltering for four months in an 800-square-foot apartment with my partner and our dog, I was on Zillow looking for places in the upstate area. When we saw the cottage and the town and learned a little more about it, it was really appealing to be a part of its renaissance.\u201d",
      "Perched on the west bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles south of Albany, Coxsackie covers roughly 37 square miles \u2014 including an eponymous 2.17-square-mile village \u2014 with a population of 8,382, according to the 2020 census. The nearly five-acre Riverside Park, adjacent to the downtown area, offers stunning views.",
      "\u201cYou just have beautiful, open park space and the most pristine riverfront,\u201d said Aaron Flach, 47, a developer and a Coxsackie native. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful natural landscape that sets us apart from any other community.\u201d",
      "Just a few years ago, Coxsackie\u2019s historic downtown was pocked with boarded-up buildings. Now the Reed Street Historic District has boutique businesses like the Reed Street Bottle Shop and the antiques store UnQuiet. On a six-acre riverside site, Mr. Flach is building a $15 million hospitality project that includes a 47-room hotel with a top-floor restaurant and deck, and a spa inside a restored electric light station. Last November, he opened a 13,000-square-foot event space in a 1906 factory adjoining the hotel site, with a glass atrium overlooking the river. Called The Wire, after the wire manufacturer that once owned the building, it has 27 events booked so far in 2023.",
      "The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation recently made $3.2 million worth of improvements to Riverside Park, including the construction of a pavilion and renovations to the boat launch. And in 2021, the state\u2019s Main Street grant program awarded $347,000 to the Reed Street Historic District to help preserve and protect its buildings.",
      "\u201cBetween Mr. Flach\u2019s project and the park, our entire riverfront area will have been renovated,\u201d said Mark Evans, 57, a Coxsackie native who has been the mayor of the village since 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place on the Hudson.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach, he added, is renovating buildings that \u201chad been vacant since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "The boutique shops popping up in historic buildings near the waterfront have helped the area approach \u201ccritical mass,\u201d said Sarah Gray Miller, 51, a former magazine editor and self-described \u201cmad collector\u201d from Natchez, Miss., who opened UnQuiet in December 2021 after selling her house in nearby ",
      "Her store occupies a 2,400-square-foot, late-19th-century brick building, once the site of a firehouse and a jail, which Ms. Miller rents for $2,500 a month.",
      "Ms. Miller began serving customers wine on Saturday afternoons and soon found herself holding a regular B.Y.O.B. gathering that evolved into a plan to open a bar with Mark Deubert, a fourth-generation Coxsackie resident. Named Ravish Liquors, after a neon sign Ms. Miller found at a Hudson, N.Y., flea market, it is expected to open this month with a Southern bar-food menu that includes crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e.",
      "Coxsackie \u201cis a very civilized place,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly welcoming to all the outsiders moving in. It does not have the same us-versus-them mentality that you see elsewhere in Greene County.\u201d",
      "Mr. Flach bought the waterfront property he is developing from the Twelve Tribes \u2014 a ",
      " that runs a chain of cafes called the Yellow Deli, including one in downtown Coxsackie \u2014 for $1 million, along with an 1860s opera house where he plans to create first-floor retail space and 10 apartments. \u201cThis is a huge project for such a small community,\u201d said Mr. Flach, who\u2019s aiming to open the hotel on June 1. \u201cI want to develop a level of vibrancy for the downtown that will bring tourists to the area and support local businesses.\u201d",
      "He also owns more than 100 apartments in town, including two historic brick buildings from the 1880s, and said they are all occupied, with waiting lists.",
      "Historic homes predominate in the village. Outside the village, Coxsackie\u2019s architecture is a mix of styles, with a number of Greek Revival farmhouses reflecting the area\u2019s agrarian past.",
      "The Reed Street Historic District consists of two- and three-story Italianate brick buildings from the mid-1800s, many painted in soft pastels. Small shops that recently have sprung up include Mansion + Reed General Store, which offers specialty groceries, espresso and pastries; Shipwrecked News, Books & Caf\u00e9, which sells sandwiches, homemade bagels, used books, and just received a liquor license; and, a few doors down, the Reed Street Bottle Shop, which carries local wines and spirits, as well as T-shirts and coffee mugs emblazoned with the phonetic spelling of the town\u2019s often mispronounced name: \u201ccook-SAH-kie.\u201d",
      "Susan Baldaserini, an owner of the wine shop and a graphic artist, designed the shirts and mugs. \u201cNow a weekend doesn\u2019t go by where I don\u2019t hear someone in the shop saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s how you say it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In 2015, when Ms. Baldaserini, 43, and her boyfriend and business partner, Shai Kessler, 45, were living in Red Hook, Brooklyn, they bought a weekend house in the neighboring town of New Baltimore. They moved upstate full-time in 2016 to open the wine shop. The following year, Ms. Baldaserini opened Pilothouse Paper, a stationery store that doubles as her graphic-design studio, across the street.",
      "\u201cA lot of people travel up and down 9W without ever knowing Reed Street exists, but if you get the hot tip to turn off 9W and onto Reed Street, it\u2019s truly charming and idyllic,\u201d she said.",
      "As Coxsackie\u2019s profile has risen, so have its home prices. The median sale price for a single-family home in 2022 was $291,000 \u2014 a jump of nearly 22 percent (from $239,000) in 2021, and nearly 53 percent (from $190,500) in 2019. It was more than the $285,000 median sale price in ",
      ", and less than the $329,500 median in ",
      ", according to the Columbia Greene Board of Realtors.",
      "Taxes are relatively low. The average county, town and school tax bill for 2021 was about $4,443 for town residents and $6,188 for village residents, said Raymond Ward, the director of real property tax services for Greene County.",
      "In mid-January, Zillow showed six single-family homes for sale in Coxsackie, from a three-bedroom ranch on 0.23 acres, listed for $189,100, to a six-bedroom home on 9.33 acres along the Hudson River, listed for $899,000.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been seeing is the people who are interested in being full-time also want to either open up a business here or do a satellite of what they\u2019re already doing in the city,\u201d said Dave Merchant, a Coxsackie native and a real estate agent at Keller Williams Hudson Valley North.",
      "Amy Bennett, who owns two businesses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, is shopping for commercial space in Coxsackie to open a farm stand. She splits her time between her Fort Greene brownstone and her Coxsackie house, but plans to spend most of her time upstate once her younger daughter graduates from high school. In addition to Greene Grape Wine & Spirits and Greene Grape Provisions, she owns five properties in Athens, including 58 acres of farmland.",
      "\u201cCoxsackie feels like it\u2019s got big energy from the waterfront development,\u201d said Ms. Bennett, 53, who bought her three-bedroom Victorian house with river views for $375,000 in May 2021. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a bigger rejuvenation going on all at once.\u201d",
      "She likes to grab coffee at Shipwrecked, pick up cream puffs at the Little Bake Shop on Mansion Street and explore the Coxsackie Antique Center in the West Coxsackie business district on Route 9W, where more than 100 antiques dealers sell their wares. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you want for a rainy Saturday, to wander through and see things you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d she said.",
      "Students in the Coxsackie-Athens Central School District attend either Coxsackie Elementary School or Edward J. Arthur Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade. They go on to Coxsackie-Athens Middle School for fifth through eighth grade, and then to Coxsackie-Athens High School.",
      "During the 2020-21 school year, the latest year for which figures were available from the New York State Education Department, the district had an enrollment of 1,188 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. About 85 percent identified as white, 8 percent as Hispanic, 5 percent as multiracial, 2 percent as Black and 1 percent as Asian or Pacific Islander.",
      "On 2021-22 state tests, 86 percent of Coxsackie-Athens High School students were proficient in English, 34 percent were proficient in algebra and 54 percent were proficient in geometry, compared with 81 percent, 66 percent and 53 percent statewide. In 2022, the average SAT verbal score was 546, compared with a statewide average of 534; the average math score was 542, versus 533 statewide.",
      "The high school\u2019s graduation rate in 2021 was 89 percent, compared with 86 percent for the state.",
      "Coxsackie is roughly a seven-minute drive from Exit 21B on the New York State Thruway. The drive to the George Washington Bridge takes about two hours, depending on traffic.",
      "The Amtrak train station in Hudson is about a 25-minute drive. Round-trip tickets to New York City cost $62 to $148, depending on when the ticket is bought and whether it is for peak or off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cThe train back on Thursday or Friday is often booked, because the area has gotten so popular,\u201d Ms. Miller said.",
      "The New York State Legislature created the town of Coxsackie in 1788, and the village was incorporated in 1867. The name is derived from an Algonquin word and has had many spellings and various translations over the years, including \u201choot of the owl,\u201d said Michael H. Rausch, the town historian. Coxsackie is also associated with ",

      ", built in 1663 and believed to be one of the oldest in upstate New York, is now a museum. Around 1810, Eliakim Reed bought riverfront property and built a wharf, known as Reed\u2019s Landing. It became a commercial hub, shipping local goods to New York City, Mr. Rausch said. The business district, including Reed Street, began to develop around 1810.",

      "Bridgeport was once unavoidable. In the middle of the last century, the waterfront Fairfield County city 60 miles from Manhattan churned out so many kinds of products, it seemed to be almost single-handedly shaping the habits of modern life. Rolling off the assembly lines there: lipstick cases, flashlights, typewriters, fans, underwear, sewing machines, cars, scissors, guns, lace, drills, helicopters and phonograph records.",
      "But some people are only familiar with the aftermath: crumbling factories languishing along major roads and railways, an inescapable reminder of a painful loss.",
      "\u201cI told my wife, \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of Bridgeport. It\u2019s too rundown,\u2019\u201d said Andy Toledo, 43. It didn\u2019t help that a favorite TV show of his, \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d mocked the city as a place of \u201cwild dogs and gas stations without pumps.\u201d",
      "But in 2021, when Mr. Toledo and his family sought to relocate to Connecticut from their cramped condo in Mott Haven, in the Bronx, they found places like Easton and Milford too pricey, driven up by the pandemic buying spree. And Mr. Toledo soon realized that parts of Bridgeport \u2014 Connecticut\u2019s largest city, with about 148,000 residents \u2014 felt revitalized, including the North End near the Trumbull border, where the Toledos bought a new three-bedroom house in December 2021 for $390,000. Mr. Toledo shares the home with his wife, Yariliz Marquez-Toledo, 42, who works remotely for a Manhattan health clinic, and their 15-year-old son (another son is in college in Boston).",
      "Even gritty areas appear to be on the mend, although the process is happening in fits and starts. Apartments, breweries and antiques shops have popped up in some of the industrial hulks. Long-empty lots that resemble prairies are being eyed as sites for housing. And a two-year-old concert venue known as the Amp has added bounce to the city\u2019s nightlife.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is reminiscent of what happened in Mott Haven,\u201d as developers try to remake a depressed area, said Mr. Toledo, who recently left his job in New York City government to work at Bridgeport City Hall and help with the comeback. \u201cThe city\u2019s turning itself around.\u201d",
      "Making peace with the old stigma often allows buyers to find a home that feels hidden in plain sight. For two decades, Janine Sjonvall, a database manager, lived a few miles away in Fairfield. Apart from occasional trips to Bridgeport for minor-league baseball games or pizza, she didn\u2019t give it much thought. It took an online house search for her to discover what was just around the corner: an upscale Bridgeport neighborhood called Black Rock, where homes are cheaper than in Fairfield, even if property taxes are higher.",
      "A three-bedroom Dutch colonial-style house there, which cost $378,000 in 2020, is her home today. \u201cIt seems everybody is moving farther out of New York; people who used to buy in Norwalk are in Stratford,\u201d said Ms. Sjonvall, 54. \u201cI just stumbled upon this place, but I\u2019m pleased.\u201d",
      "Of course, development often leads to gentrification, which can encourage landlords to evict tenants and replace them with higher-paying ones. Already, some longtime residents are moving out, said Callie Gale Heilmann, a Bridgeport resident and a founder of the advocacy group Bridgeport Generation Now.",
      "City officials seem unwilling to attach strings to force developers to incorporate affordable housing in their projects: \u201cWe do need to grow our tax base, which has remained flat for years,\u201d Ms. Heilmann said. \u201cBut we have to ask ourselves: Who is the city for? Is it for people who have lived here their whole lives?\u201d",
      "Despite Bridgeport\u2019s large population, the 15-square-mile city is small among Connecticut\u2019s municipalities. The home lots are tiny, too, making the place feel dense.",
      "But the city is mostly houses, many in the Cape Cod-style popular around World War II, when Bridgeport was humming. The Brooklawn neighborhood comprises Capes and older colonials, and Arcadia and Hughes Avenues there are part of a well-kept pocket by the Rooster River. The tall, well-maintained 1960s condo towers along upper Park Avenue are an exception; they wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Miami Beach.",
      "In the South End, aged multifamily houses sit near former factories and student housing for the University of Bridgeport. Seaside Village, a co-op with shutter-lined brick homes built during World War I for workers at munitions factories, seems ageless.",
      "Black Rock has a similar co-op, the 36-building landmark Black Rock Gardens, on Fairfield Avenue. But Tudors, Mediterranean-style and modern homes, some quite large, are more common in this set-apart area, which residents prize for its walkability, next to Long Island Sound.",
      "On the East Side, rambling Italianates in pastel hues and showy Second Empires hug the streets around Washington Park, the onetime command central for mill owners. Citywide, more than a dozen buildings or districts are on the National Register of Historic Places.",
      "Since its industrial heyday, when Hungarians, Italians, Portuguese and immigrants from many other countries poured into the factory yards, Bridgeport has been a hub for newcomers, including a surge in the 1950s of Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Today, according to census figures, the racial makeup is 42 percent Latino, 35 percent Black, 18 percent white and 5 percent Asian.",
      "In the last five years, more than 1,500 apartments have been completed, are under construction or planned, in new and converted buildings that are mostly downtown, according to the Bridgeport Building Department. A three-building complex next to Interstate 95, in a former gramophone record factory on Cherry Street and Howard Avenue that had been abandoned for decades, is completed and occupied, with 174 apartments, market-rate and affordable.",
      "At a 104-unit brick complex at Main and Golden Hill Streets, called 1188 Lofts, the lights are now on in what had been boarded-up windows. Market-rate studios there start at $1,630 a month, and one-bedrooms at $1,865.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been sort of a diamond in the rough, but we\u2019re getting discovered,\u201d said John Guedes, the president of Primrose Companies, a developer about to cut a ribbon on a former Holiday Inn at 1070 Main Street going from 267 rooms to 94 apartments. Units will come furnished with the hotel\u2019s furniture, and one-bedrooms will start at $2,500 a month.",
      "Mr. Guedes is also constructing a 92-unit building at 1269 Main, a $22 million project, and is planning to add 112 units to an office building at 855 Main. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have affordable housing in these downtowns,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause nobody will spend money at night and they will become ghost towns.\u201d",
      "In late January, there were 78 single-family homes for sale in Bridgeport, at an average list price of $510,000, according to data from Antonio Coelho, an agent with William Pitt Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.",
      "At the high end was a five-bedroom house in Black Rock listed for $1.35 million; the least expensive was a two-bedroom in foreclosure in the Hollow neighborhood, for $156,000.",
      "There were also 41 multifamily homes listed for sale, at an average price of $442,000, Mr. Coelho said. And 26 condos were available for an average of $194,000.",
      "Deal activity appears to have come back to earth after a pandemic surge, brokers say. In 2022, 666 single-family homes sold, down from 716 in 2019, according to Sotheby\u2019s, although prices remain elevated, suggesting that demand remains robust. The 2022 average sale price was $326,000 \u2014 more than 50 percent higher than 2019\u2019s average of $210,000.",
      "\u201cIn the last couple years, Bridgeport has really gone nuts,\u201d said Mr. Coelho, who emigrated from Portugal to the Hollow in 1970 when he was 12, although he lives in nearby Shelton today. \u201cIt was little rough here in the \u201970s, but there are so many positive things going on now.\u201d",
      "Although often criticized for its crime, Bridgeport\u2019s rates appear on a par with those of other comparable cities. In 2019, there were 2,506 major crimes, including assaults, robberies and car thefts, and 17 murders, according to police statistics. In 2022, by comparison, there were 1,729 major crimes, including 15 murders, suggesting that the pandemic spike has ebbed.",
      "The poverty rate is 23 percent, below New Haven\u2019s (25 percent) and Hartford\u2019s (28 percent), but higher than Stamford\u2019s (9 percent), according to the census.",
      "Frederick Law Olmsted, known as a designer of Central Park, worked his magic on two green spaces in Bridgeport: 181-acre Beardsley Park, which contains the state\u2019s only zoo, and 375-acre Seaside Park, which offers a gentle crescent of sand. A statue of P.T. Barnum, resident, mayor and circus legend, surveys the waves with a serious expression.",
      "Boldly offbeat community radio station WPKN entertains at all hours, while Fairfield Avenue in Black Rock bustles at night. In January, Park City Music Hall hosted a Van Halen tribute band and an act called Beatniks Organ Trio. Total Mortgage Arena offers hockey games and concerts, and the Amp next door \u2014 officially, the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater, a 5,700-seat conversion of a former baseball stadium \u2014 hosts bands.",

      "Bridgeport\u2019s school district, which had 39 schools and programs for about 19,000 students in the 2021-22 school year, has not been among the state\u2019s best, but perhaps is not as troubled as some think.",
      "On the state\u2019s 2022 Smarter Balanced assessment exams, given to students in third through eighth grade, 60.5 percent met standards in English, compared with 60.4 percent statewide, and 57 percent met standards in math, compared with 65 percent statewide. (Stamford, a nearby city with a 16,000-student district, didn\u2019t fare much differently: 57 percent of students met standards in English and 58 percent met standards in math.)",
      "Overall, 65 percent of Bridgeport\u2019s students are eligible for free or reduced-cost meals, while the statewide figure is 41 percent. Bridgeport\u2019s six high schools have a four-year graduation rate of 76 percent, versus Connecticut\u2019s 90 percent overall rate.",
      "School officials say Bridgeport\u2019s system is chronically underfunded. Last year, spending there was $16,439 a student; in contrast, Stamford spent $19,625, according to state data.",
      "Bridgeport has a major stop on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven train line, from which 10 trains depart for Grand Central on weekdays between 6 and 8 a.m. The shortest trip takes an hour and 21 minutes; the longest takes an hour and 45 minutes.

      "When Stephen Foglia and his fianc\u00e9e, JoAnne Crimeni, decided it was time to leave Brooklyn and put down roots, they headed south to New Jersey. Traveling through a number of areas they couldn\u2019t afford, they came upon Freehold Township, a place they knew only from having been to the mall there.",
      "\u201cRent was getting expensive, and we wanted something that was ours, not somebody else\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Foglia, 32, a carrier for the United States Postal Service. \u201cWe were still working in New York at that time, but the closer you got to the city, the more expensive it was. So we just kept heading down and decided that Freehold was where it was at.\u201d",
      "In August 2018, the couple bought a two-bedroom condominium in the Raintree development for $235,000, and two months later they married. Now they have a daughter who is nearly 2 and a second child on the way. And Mr. Foglia and Ms. Crimeni, the recreation director at the CentraState assisted living facility in Freehold, have no plans to move.",
      "\u201cWe love it here. Everything feels like what we were used to,\u201d Mr. Foglia said. \u201cIn Manalapan and Marlboro, the people are kind of flashy, but in Freehold, they\u2019re very down-to-earth.\u201d",
      "Roslyn Sibilia, an agent with ERA Central Realty Group, said clients like the Foglias, who make their way to the township from New York, typically travel south along Route 9, discovering that \u201cby the time you get to Freehold, everything seems to open up a lot more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hub, and that\u2019s what makes it desirable,\u201d said Ms. Sibilia, 52, who moved to Freehold Township from Manalapan, N.J., in 2004. \u201cWe have great park programs for parents and kids, a lot of good school choices, the mall, a major medical center. There\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d",
      "When Chris and Amy MacDougall bought their home in Freehold in 2010, Mr. MacDougall was already familiar with the township, having moved there with his family in 2000, when he was 21. Ten years later, he and his wife bought a four-bedroom 1960 colonial in East Freehold for their own growing family, paying $350,000. The MacDougalls are now very involved with their three daughters\u2019 school and sports activities: Ms. MacDougall helps with the high school yearbook, and Mr. MacDougall coaches the girls\u2019 soccer teams.",
      "A senior claims superintendent with Admiral Insurance Group, Mr. MacDougall, 44, describes the 38-square-mile township with major highways running through it as a \u201csweet spot,\u201d both geographically and demographically: \u201cSome towns are too snooty, but you don\u2019t get that facade here. In Freehold, it\u2019s real people with real jobs and real struggles. And we fit in perfectly with that.\u201d",
      "For Elizabeth Robertson, landing in Freehold was serendipitous. After 32 years of living in North Jersey, she was looking to change her life and \u201cjust threw everything up in the air\u201d in 2005. Knowing nothing about Freehold, but wanting to be near the beach \u2014 Freehold is about 18 miles west of the shore \u2014 Ms. Robertson moved first to a townhouse in East Freehold. Five years ago, she moved again, two miles south, paying $365,000 for a four-bedroom, split-level house that she shares with her daughter and two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cWhen I came here, I had no idea what kind of town this was,\u201d said Ms. Robertson, who is now 71 and retired. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I\u2019m here. I\u2019ve made a lot of good friends, and my grandchildren are now doing the same thing.\u201d",
      "Freehold Township is the expansive doughnut surrounding the much smaller Freehold Borough, the historic seat of Monmouth County. With shared high schools and many shared services, the township (pop. 35,367) and the borough (pop. 12,525) are frequently seen as interchangeable, although the township is more suburban, with more spacious lots and houses mostly built in the mid to late 20th century.",
      "Route 9, a major north-south highway dotted with shopping plazas and restaurants, is considered the dividing line between East Freehold, bordering Colts Neck and Marlboro, and West Freehold, bordering Howell and Jackson. East Freehold has some of the township\u2019s larger houses, most of which have access to public water and sewer systems, and is home to Poets Corner, a development with 376 townhouses and apartments. West Freehold is closer to the township\u2019s commercial activity and is home to Raintree, a gated community with more than 1,000 townhouses, condominiums and single-family houses.",
      "Naturally, both sections have their fans. \u201cPeople who live in West Freehold think it\u2019s the greatest, and those who live in East Freehold say they would never go to West,\u201d said Melissa DeSantis, 51, a broker associate with Real Broker LLC, who has made YouTube videos on both sections of the township, as well as Freehold Borough.",
      "The township also has three 55-plus adult-living communities, a mobile-home park and a sizable stock of affordable housing, including 250 units that will remain permanently affordable, said Maureen Fasano, a member of the Township Committee and a former mayor. Freehold Raceway Mall, the state\u2019s third largest mall, sits between Routes 9 and 33. CentraState Medical Center, on West Main Street, includes a 284-bed hospital, long-term care and a wellness center.",
      "The township has numerous parks as well, including a portion of the Monmouth Battlefield State Park and the Monmouth County Fairgrounds, which contribute to the more than 9,500 acres of open space. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a big commitment to green space,\u201d Ms. Fasano said, noting that the township recently increased the added tax for open space acquisitions to $0.04 per $1,000 of a home\u2019s assessed value.",
      "Freehold is considered more affordable than many of the neighboring areas. In 2022, the average sale price of a house in the township was $624,665, down slightly from 2021\u2019s average sale price of $636,276, according to the Monmouth Ocean Regional Multiple Listing Service.",
      "As of mid-February, there were 14 single-family houses on the market, along with six condominiums or townhouses and six homes in 55-plus communities. The lowest priced single-family house was a three-bedroom 1957 raised ranch house on 0.34 acres, listed for $299,900; the highest priced was a four-bedroom 2004 house on an acre, listed for $1.289 million. The lowest priced condominium or townhouse was a two-bedroom condo listed for $319,900; the highest priced was a two-bedroom townhouse listed for $427,500 (both were in the Raintree development). As for 55-plus homes, the least expensive was a two-bedroom bungalow listed for $179,900; the most expensive was a three-bedroom house in Regent Oaks, a new Toll Brothers community near Route 9, listed for $743,995.",
      "Much of the family-oriented activity takes place in Michael J. Tighe Park, a sprawling municipal park with ball fields, picnic sites, trails, a splash park and a summer park program. The 81-acre East Freehold Showgrounds is the site of numerous horse and dog shows, as well as the annual Monmouth County Fair.",
      "For indoor entertainment, residents head to the 175-acre Freehold Raceway Mall, which has an AMC movie theater and many chain stores and restaurants, or to iPlay America, a four-acre enclosed amusement park with games and rides. For evening entertainment, residents often head to Freehold Borough, with its Victorian-era Main Street lined with ethnic and upscale restaurants, or drive to nearby shoreline communities like Asbury Park or Belmar Beach.",
      "Public school students start out at one of Freehold\u2019s five elementary schools, moving on to one of two middle schools and then, depending on where they live, to Freehold Township High School, which has almost 2,000 students, or Freehold High School in Freehold Borough, which has about 1,300.",
      "As part of the Freehold Regional High School District, the township is linked to four other high schools in the area \u2014 in Manalapan, Howell, Colts Neck and Marlboro \u2014 each of which has subject-specific magnet programs to which Freehold students can apply. The Freehold Township High School\u2019s two magnet programs are in global studies and animal and botanical science; the high school in Freehold Borough has programs in culinary arts and hospitality, as well as medical sciences.",
      "In 2021-22, average SAT scores at the high school in Freehold Borough were 583 in reading and writing and 598 in math; at Freehold Township High School, they were 568 in reading and writing and 567 in math. (State averages were 557 in reading and 560 in math.)",
      "Private school options in the area include St. Rose of Lima, a Catholic school in Freehold Borough for students in prekindergarten through eighth grade, and the Peddie School, a day and boarding school in Hightstown for students in ninth through 12th grade.",
      "Many commuters catch the New Jersey Transit No. 139 bus at the Freehold Center station in Freehold Borough; the trip to Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan takes about 70 minutes and costs $16 one way or $377 for a monthly pass. Others catch the New Jersey Transit No. 67 bus at Freehold Raceway Mall and switch at Freehold Center; by that route, the trip to Port Authority takes about 90 minutes and costs $17.60 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "The closest train station is Aberdeen-Matawan, about 12 miles north. From there, the trip to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan on a direct New Jersey Transit train takes a little over an hour and costs $14.75 one way or $421 for a monthly pass.",
      "Freehold and neighboring Manalapan Township were the site of the Battle of Monmouth, one of the biggest and most important battles of the Revolutionary War. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army, led by George Washington, intercepted British troops traveling to New York City from Philadelphia in a battle that involved 26,000 soldiers and most of the major military figures of the time, including the Marquis de Lafayette, Benedict Arnold, Anthony Wayne and Alexander Hamilton. With 600 Americans killed and 700 British casualties, both sides claimed victory.",

      "Hai Yang, 37, lives in a one-bedroom apartment overlooking the Byram River in downtown Port Chester, a 2.4-square-mile village in the town of Rye, in Westchester County. Since moving to the $2,700-a-month apartment a year ago, Mr. Yang has found he can walk to most everything he needs.",
      "The Metro-North train station is a three-minute walk, which makes it easy to head into New York City to visit friends. Happy hour deals and live jazz are right next door, at the Saltaire Oyster Bar. And he doesn\u2019t need a car to hit the local gym.",
      "But Mr. Yang does have a car, so he can commute to his job in Danbury, Conn., where he is an engineering manager in the medical device industry. Finding a place to park in Port Chester is not an issue \u2014 particularly compared to his experience in downtown White Plains, N.Y., where he used to live. And the village, in general, is \u201cmuch less congested,\u201d he said.",
      "Deirdre Curran, 57, moved into a townhouse across from the village\u2019s 20-acre Lyon Park last June. A retired pet sitter and dog walker, Ms. Curran had rented in the village off and on over the years, and appreciates its diversity. \u201cThere are a lot of different cultures, and you can get any kind of food you want from Central and South America,\u201d she said.",
      "She paid $515,000 for her two-bedroom home, which is convenient to downtown businesses, major highways and the Westchester County Airport. But while Ms. Curran loves her home\u2019s location, she is increasingly alarmed by the scale and pace of residential development planned for the compact downtown area.",
      "Three large, mixed-use apartment projects are currently under construction. The six-story Tarry Lighthouse, on North Main, will have 209 apartments as well as commercial space. The Magellan, on South Main, will add another 95 apartments in a nine-story, 100-percent electrified building. And 30 Broad, across from the train station, will have 36 apartments above a microbrewery.",
      "These follow the recent completion of Port & Main, a five-story, 80-unit building a block from the train station.",
      "\u201cThey want to do all this major development in this tiny little village that does not have the infrastructure to handle it,\u201d Ms. Curran said. \u201cIt seems to me like an awful lot of major development in a very short period of time.\u201d",
      "The village has granted conditional site plan approval to projects with a total of more than 2,800 units over the past three years, said Stuart L. Rabin, the village manager. This flurry of development proposals is largely the result of a change in village zoning three years ago designed to encourage the redevelopment and revitalization of Port Chester\u2019s downtown, waterfront and transit-adjacent parcels, he said.",
      "\u201cThe village of Port Chester is certainly on the move,\u201d Mr. Rabin said.",
      "But the scale of the proposals has generated considerable public pushback, with some residents expressing concern that towering apartment buildings threaten to overwhelm the historic downtown and price out the many mom-and-pop businesses.",
      "John Allen, an elected member of Port Chester\u2019s board of trustees, said that while the village was \u201cripe for redevelopment,\u201d given the number of buildings in disrepair, there is a growing sense that the board allowed for \u201cthese extraordinary increases for density and asked for very little in return from developers,\u201d including having to meet more of the community\u2019s affordable housing needs.",
      "The board has recently begun to discuss a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d moratorium on development in order to study whether further changes are needed to the zoning code, he said. A moratorium would not affect projects already under construction.",
      "Port Chester is a densely developed village of 31,000 that \u201csprang to life at the crossroads of various transportation options,\u201d including a small harbor on Long Island Sound and rail lines into New York City, said Gregg Hamilton, a retired Manhattan transplant who runs the ",

      "Some remnants of its 19th- and early 20th-century industrial heyday remain. The Simons Manufacturing Company building, which once housed a major textile maker, is now a loft-style office complex. And the former headquarters of the Life Savers Candy Company now houses condominiums.",
      "In the walkable downtown area, beauty salons, restaurants and grocery stores catering to the village\u2019s majority-Hispanic population line the main thoroughfares of Westchester Avenue and North and South Main. (According to census data, the village population is 64 percent Hispanic, 28 percent white, 5 percent Black and 1 percent Asian.) Two large commercial bakeries \u2014 Neri\u2019s and J.J. Cassone \u2014 are major employers.",
      "Modest single-family and multifamily homes set close to the hilly streets surround the downtown. To the north, the streets are wider, and homes are set farther apart in suburban-style neighborhoods.",
      "A 15-acre abandoned hospital campus on the edge of downtown, ",
      ", is now set for redevelopment by Rose Associates and BedRock Real Estate Partners. The companies have received site plan approval for nearly 1,000 housing units, including 200 age-restricted units, and expect to begin demolition of the existing buildings by spring, said Richard Shea, a project spokesman.",
      "The nonprofit Carver Center supports the community\u2019s lower-income and immigrant populations with a food bank, citizenship classes, after-school programming and a teen center.",
      "As in most of Westchester County, housing inventory in Port Chester is very low and it is a seller\u2019s market, said Thomas E. Consaga, the broker-owner at Re/Max Ace Realty. Competition is particularly high among first-time buyers because home prices are considerably lower than in surrounding suburbs like Greenwich, Conn., and Rye, N.Y., he said.",
      "The median sale price for a single-family home in Port Chester last year was $645,000, almost 10 percent higher than in 2021. By comparison, the 2022 ",
      " in neighboring Greenwich was almost $3 million.",
      "As of last week, there were only about 20 single-family homes on the market, Mr. Consaga said. They ranged from a three-bedroom colonial built in 1955, listed for $475,000, to a six-bedroom colonial built in 1900, listed for $1.34 million.",
      "The median sale price for a condominium last year was $347,500; for a cooperative, it was $118,000, he said.",
      "Almost 60 percent of households in Port Chester are renter-occupied, according to census data. Over the last 12 months, the median rent for a two-bedroom was $2,800, Mr. Consaga said.",
      "That figure factors in the many older, multifamily homes in the village, but rents at the new apartment buildings are considerably higher. At Port & Main, which has a rooftop terrace and a fitness center, a 400-square-foot studio starts at $2,300 a month and an 1,150-square-foot, two-bedroom rents for more than $4,000, said Whitney Okun, who runs a development group at Houlihan Lawrence that is overseeing the project.",

      "The parking lot at the Waterfront at Port Chester mall is jammed on weekends with shoppers stocking up at Costco. The mall\u2019s other draw is a 14-screen AMC movie theater.",
      "The growing arts scene includes the well-established Clay Art Center, a large complex with numerous pottery studios and classrooms, as well as a public gallery, and Ice Cream Social, a relatively new space where artists working in various media can rent private or shared studios.",
      "\u201cPort Chester is my hometown, so it\u2019s kind of a dream to be able to support the artists who are here,\u201d said Jennifer Cacciola, an artist and a founder of the center, who moved to Connecticut from Brooklyn shortly before the pandemic.",
      "The Port Chester-Rye Union Free School District serves students in all of Port Chester and about a third of the neighboring village of Rye Brook. Of the roughly 4,500 students districtwide, about 83 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino, 12 percent as white, 3 percent as Black and 2 percent as Asian, according to state education data.",
      "The district contracts with Corpus Christi Holy Rosary School to provide a prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds. Students in kindergarten through fifth grade attend one of four elementary schools; those in sixth through eighth grade attend Port Chester Middle School.",
      "Port Chester High School is on a 20-acre campus bordering Rye Brook, with about 1,600 students. Academic offerings include Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses. The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2022 was 88 percent.",
      "Port Chester station, on Metro-North\u2019s New Haven line, is in the heart of downtown. The ride to Grand Central during peak commuting times takes just under an hour; the one-way fare is $13.75, and a monthly pass is $270.",

As the factories closed, more immigrants from throughout Central and South America settled in the working-class village, opening restaurants and servicing the affluent suburbs as landscapers, day laborers, house cleaners and child-care providers. The population growth hasn\u2019t been without tensions: In 2009, a federal judge ordered the village to adopt a new voting system that would give the Hispanic and Latino population a fairer opportunity to elect one of their own to the board of trustees.

For example, depending on where you see yourself living next, tenants who are at least 62 years old may terminate their lease without penalty if they\u2019re moving into a health care facility, senior housing complex or government subsidized housing, said Andrew Scherer, a professor of law at New York Law School and the author of \u201cResidential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York.\u201d",
      "Because the faulty elevator has created a health hazard, you also could potentially break your lease and claim that you have been \u201cconstructively evicted,\u201d Mr. Scherer said. According to Cornell Law School\u2019s Legal Information Institute, ",

Failure to keep the elevator functioning \u201cis a breach of the landlord\u2019s obligation to maintain the residence,\u201d Mr. Scherer said. So you could be entitled to a reduction of rent for the months you\u2019ve gone without it working properly. You also could band with your neighbors and form a tenants\u2019 association to \u201ccommence a legal proceeding to obtain a court order to force the landlord to fix the problem,\u201d he said.

      "You want to find a broker who is familiar with your neighborhood, your price point and the type of building you live in. A broker who focuses on Brooklyn brownstones is probably not a good match for a condo in Harlem. So interview several agents, including ones who have sold in your building before. You want to find out how they will price your apartment, market it, stage it and sell it. They should provide you with a pricing strategy, based on comparable sales in your area.",

      "Ask for references, and if the broker has sold in your building, speak with the neighbors who worked with them. Look for online references, too. You want a broker who will give you personal attention. If they are the leader of a team, will they be the person at your open house? Will they take your calls? Or will you get handed off to an associate? Ask how many listings they currently have, and how much time they will devote to yours. \u201cIt\u2019s all about a broker that makes themselves available,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Arc said.",

      "Like so many others, she and her three children had been rocked by the pandemic a few years earlier. She had been grateful to live in a three-bedroom, two-bath house in the Bronx where on good days, she could find a parking space and was able to take both girls to their schools in White Plains in under half an hour. But the house quickly became too small, especially as she worked from home and her son Treylin, 21, and daughters London, 14, and Gia, 11, attended school remotely.",

I needed a more grown-up space,\u201d said Ms. Woods, 41, who shares custody with her ex-partner who lives in White Plains. \u201cMy daughters were battling it out and needed their own room, which they have at their dad\u2019s.

Another mover took her deposit, she said, then ghosted her. Ms. Woods rented a small truck and filled it with boxes to make the 13-minute trip to and from one home to another when she could. Finally, a third mover transported the last of her items.",

      "In 2008, Ms. Trump married a young man of her own, Rossano Rubicondi, a sometime actor in his 30s who appeared on the show. The marriage was turbulent and lasted ",
      ".",
      "In 2009, Ms. Trump was escorted off a plane after getting in an argument with a group of children running through first class.",
      "In 2016, she offered full-throated support to Mr. Trump\u2019s successful presidential run. But afterward she was devastated that she was not first lady and that the children she had raised were largely in Washington. She was accosted on the street by anti-Trumpers, yet refused security that might have made her feel safer.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Get a handsome security guard,\u2019\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t. The whole presidency took a tremendous toll on her.\u201d ",
      "According to Ms. Haskell, Ms. Trump never fully got over Mr. Trump. But Mr. Rubicondi continued to pop up.",
      "Ms. Haskell thought he was after Ms. Trump\u2019s money. \u201cI used to say, \u2018His meter is always running,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Concern about Ms. Trump\u2019s mental state grew, and the house that had once been a symbol of Ms. Trump\u2019s resilience began to seem more like a sign that things were going awry.",
      "\u201cI begged her to get rid of it and move into a full-service residence at the Pierre,\u201d said Ms. Haskell, referring to a nearby luxury hotel. \u201cBut Ivana was Ivana. She did exactly what she wanted to do.\u201d",
      "Ms. Haskell talked to Ms. Trump repeatedly about the stairs she couldn\u2019t stand because \u201cthey were narrow toward the banister and wide toward the walls.\u201d",
      "What frightened Ms. Trump was not falling down the stairs, but getting stuck in the elevator. So she didn\u2019t take it.",
      "Then, in 2020, shortly after the pandemic began, Mr. Rubicondi was diagnosed with Stage 4 skin cancer. Ms. Trump flew him from Italy to New York, and got him an apartment near the townhouse so he could receive treatment here, according to New York Magazine. But he died in October 2021.",
      "When vaccinations loosened Covid-19 restrictions, friends thought Ms. Trump would be thrilled to re-emerge. Instead, she retreated, \u201chousebound by her own desire,\u201d as Ms. Haskell put it.",
      "In retrospect, Mr. Basso said, it should have been perfectly clear Ms. Trump was never going to leave.",
      "\u201cWhere was she going to go?\u201d Mr. Basso said. \u201cFrom that house to a two-bedroom apartment? She wasn\u2019t doing that. She liked her environment, she was happy with the way it looked, and whether it\u2019s your taste or mine doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "But Ms. Haskell said that when she heard in July that Ms. Trump had died, the first words out of her mouth were \u201cThe stairs?\u201d",

      " Ms. Curry, her longtime assistant. Eric took charge of the sale of the townhouse, according to a person who has had some involvement with the listing and declined to comment because Eric has asked everyone involved not to do interviews about it.",
      "To handle the sale, the family selected Adam Modlin of The Modlin Group and Roger Erickson of Douglas Elliman. In 2020, Mr. Modlin worked for Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s estate on the sale of Mr. Epstein\u2019s Upper East Townhouse. He has also worked for the estate to sell Mr. Epstein\u2019s two Caribbean islands. (A representative at Douglas Elliman said Mr. Modlin and Mr. Erickson would not comment.)",
      "There is little question that the value of the residences at Trump-branded properties in New York took a hit after he launched his 2016 campaign for President. But another, perhaps more significant obstacle for Ms. Trump\u2019s adult children, Mr. Basso said, is that the property is huge and the design not to everyone\u2019s taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty facade,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one is buying the place and not redoing it. It may have been done by the best designer of its period, but nobody with this kind of money wants a 30-year-old bathroom, and that\u2019s how long she was in that apartment.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the market has corrected since its pandemic peak.",
      " from Ms. Trump sits the ",
      " formerly owned by the Versaces.",
      "It, too, has a limestone facade, gilded curtains, stately chandeliers and leopard print carpeting.",

      ", it can now be had for $60 million.",
      "By contrast, Ms. Trump\u2019s children are asking for a mere $26.5 million, and the death of the house\u2019s last resident is not exactly a selling point.",
      "\u201cIvana brought a warmth and excitement to the house,\u201d Mr. Bouwer said. \u201cNow it seems a little creepy, particularly given that she passed away there and so alone. It\u2019s heartbreaking to think about.\u201d"

      "Functionality is important in a foyer or entry hall: You need somewhere to put down your packages and keys, take off your shoes and hang up your jacket.",
      "But there\u2019s something else that matters just as much. Whether you have a proper foyer or not, the entry to your home is the first space you (and your guests) encounter after stepping through the front door. Why not give it some style and spark a little joy?",
      "The foyer \u201csets the stage for what\u2019s to come in the rest of the house,\u201d said Jennifer Bunsa, the founder of ",
      ", a Miami-based interior design firm. Because entryways are often small, they\u2019re usually not very architecturally impressive, she added, \u201cso we want to introduce some other elements that will attract the eye and make an impact.\u201d",
      "We asked her and other interior designers for some advice on how to do that.",
      "In any small space \u2014 a powder room, a foyer \u2014 adding wallpaper, an appealing paint color or paneling can make the room feel more special. \u201cSometimes people get a bit scared of using wallpaper in a space that maybe isn\u2019t huge, because they feel like it might be too busy for the eye,\u201d said Nicole Salvesen, a founder of ",
      ", a London-based interior design firm. \u201cBut it can actually help to calm the space.\u201d",
      "In an Arts-and-Crafts-style house in Boulder, Colo., Salvesen Graham added ",
      " wallpaper with a repeating blue-and-green floral pattern, and painted the trim around it sage green. That helped create a cohesive look \u201cthat\u2019s actually gentle on the eyes,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said. In the narrow entrance hall of a home in London, the designers used a different approach to similar effect, adding fluted-plaster panels to the walls to create visual interest without making the space feel suffocating.",
      "When designing the foyer of her midcentury-modern home in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y., ",
      ", a New York-based designer, lined the walls with custom wallpaper from ",
      ". The pattern features pieces of silver leaf that are crowded together near the ceiling but spaced out farther down the walls, so they appear to be tumbling toward the floor. \u201cIt looks almost like snowflakes,\u201d Ms. Woodhouse said, creating an effect that is eye-catching but \u201cvery light, bright and airy.\u201d",
      "As you put on and take off your shoes, it\u2019s natural to focus on the floor of your entryway. That creates another opportunity to do something interesting.",
      "Ms. Bunsa is a fan of using encaustic cement tiles with colorful graphic patterns in foyers. In a home in Jamesport, N.Y., she installed hexagonal tiles with mustard, light blue and dark blue details from ",
      " in a randomized pattern for a bold, geometric look. In her own home in Miami, she used rectangular tiles with free-form, black-and-white shapes, also from Popham Design, running them across the floor and up one wall.",
      "\u201cI wanted to play with the idea of the classic black-and-white checkerboard tile floor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the Popham tile changes it up and makes it feel more modern.\u201d",
      "For a client\u2019s home in Roslyn, N.Y., Ms. Woodhouse riffed on a traditional stone floor by installing triangular marble tiles from ",
      " in various colors, including white, black, red, pink, blue and green. \u201cBecause it was a small space, we were looking for that eye-candy moment that would pop,\u201d Ms. Woodhouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you would least expect it, which really makes a statement.\u201d",
      "If a statement floor isn\u2019t for you, or if you already have a serviceable plain floor in place, you could change the look of the ceiling with paint or wallpaper.",
      "When ",
      ", an interior designer based in Northern California, was renovating the foyer of a 1906 house with a dark hardwood floor and handsome white wall paneling, she decided to liven things up by adding striped wallpaper from Schumacher to the ceiling.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to keep it feeling very elegant, but add a playful quality,\u201d Ms. Clark said. Now, she said, \u201cThe room has an almost tented feel.\u201d",
      "A foyer is a great place to install a sculptural pendant, chandelier or sconces, as large light fixtures can make small spaces feel a little more grand. In a country house in Surrey, England, the designers at Salvesen Graham installed a pair of ",
      " metal-and-glass globe pendants in a narrow entryway. \u201cChoosing a big, round light fitting can make the space feel a bit wider and more spacious,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said.",
      "In the foyer of a house outside San Francisco, Ms. Clark chose a traditional two-foot-tall lantern from ",
      " for the center of the space. The powder-coated pink metal frame adds a touch of whimsy. \u201cIt\u2019s just that pop of color, which is unexpected,\u201d Ms. Clark said.",
      ", a New York-based interior designer, sometimes looks for light fixtures that offer multiple points of light. In a house in Los Angeles, she installed a multi-armed, flush-mount fixture that stretches out with eight diffusers. For a home in Palm Beach, Fla., she chose a ",
      " fixture with six shades woven from recycled soda bottles sprouting from a single ceiling canopy on multicolored cords.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to juxtapose the formality of the architecture with some really good informality,\u201d Ms. Vi\u00f1as said.",
      "When guests arrive at a 19th-century Gothic Revival house in upstate New York where Ms. Vi\u00f1as designed the interiors, the center table in the foyer, from ",
      ", stops them in their tracks: It\u2019s shaped like a pig, with a tray on its back. \u201cHaving the first object you see inside be a little tongue-in-cheek is unusual,\u201d Ms. Vi\u00f1as said. \u201cDoing things that are not just the obvious choices speaks to the personalities of the people who live there.\u201d",
      "Of course, those choices don\u2019t have to be so playful, but selecting standout furniture and accessories that encourage closer inspection can help make the foyer a destination. When designing her home in Miami, for instance, Ms. Bunsa installed a geometric planter from ",
      " in Yves Klein blue that holds a tall cactus, as well as a bench with an intricately woven seat from ",
      " to create multiple moments of interest.",
      "In more traditional homes, Salvesen Graham aims to mix intriguing antiques, fabrics with colorful patterns and contemporary art to create interiors that feel lively. In the foyer the firm designed in Surrey, for instance, they installed antique blue-and-white ceramics, lampshades and pillows made with a yellow gingham fabric and three-dimensional cut-paper contemporary art by ",
      " mounted in an acrylic box.",
      "\u201cIn all our interiors, we use antiques and vintage pieces to help the house feel more authentic and grounded,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said. \u201cWe use a real mix, because that\u2019s how people really live.\u201d",
      "Ms. Salvesen also recommended installing full-size furniture, even in moderately sized foyers where you may assume you need smaller pieces. While truly tiny entryways do require space-saving furniture, if you have just a little extra breathing room, \u201cbig pieces of furniture can stop it from feeling like a long, narrow space,\u201d Ms. Salvesen said, and make it look like a proper room.",
      "If you have enough space, install a bench with a generous upholstered seat, for example, rather than one so skinny it feels like sitting on a two-by-four. If you have an empty corner, bring in an armchair. Likewise, choose an impressive credenza or center table instead of feeling like you have to find a shallow console or wall shelf.",
      "Ms. Woodhouse, blessed with a large entry space, took this approach to heart and installed a velvet-covered ottoman that provides seating on all sides. \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually hang out in entryways,\u201d Ms. Woodhouse said. \u201cBut I have to tell you, people actually hang out in my entryway.\u201d",

    "name": "How to Grow Dahlias? A Ceramist Has Some Advice for You",
    "author": "New York Times",

      "It\u2019s time to unpack the dahlias, and Frances Palmer finds herself surrounded by 25 sizable cardboard cartons full of tubers that she dug up and then stored last fall in the frost-proof cellar of her barn.",
      "To complete the coals-to-Newcastle scene: Several boxes of new tubers she ordered have just arrived, too. Who could have resisted ordering them, even when already in possession of a massive overwintered inventory?",
      "Not ",
      ", a ceramist based in Weston, Conn., whose art and garden have intertwined and grown together over three decades. Each has informed the other, taking on a bit of its shape and character.",
      "Dahlias to the max \u2014 apparently there can be no such thing as too many dahlias. As she put it, \u201cThey\u2019re just so joyous.\u201d",
      "The products of her two forms of self-expression have posed for many portraits together, as Ms. Palmer, 66, has cultivated a third creative pursuit: photography. The images fill her popular ",
      " and her 2020 book, \u201cLife in the Studio: Inspiration and Lessons on Creativity.\u201d",
      "Ms. Palmer\u2019s ceramics are highly distinctive, but entirely functional. These vases, dinnerware and serving pieces are meant to be sold, and used. From the start, she wanted to document her designs, and realized she could lend a sense of scale by working in some props. Like flowers in the vases.",
      "\u201cThat was really my impetus to start gardening,\u201d she said. Once she did, no flower tugged at her harder than the dahlia.",
      "In her connection to them, Ms. Palmer is in good company among creative women, including Frida Kahlo (who grew them in her garden in Mexico, where dahlias are native, and was frequently pictured wearing them like a crown). Vanessa Bell, a member of the Bloomsbury Group, grew and painted dahlias at Charleston farmhouse in East Sussex, England, and a memorable photograph of the contemporary Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama as a child shows her holding four giant ones.",
      "That\u2019s no surprise, really, considering the flowers\u2019 vivid color palette, sculptural geometry (the shapes include preposterous pompons and balls as well as spiky cactus-like blooms) and size (from less than two inches to almost a foot across).",
      "Although she won\u2019t put a number on it, Ms. Palmer acknowledges growing \u201chundreds\u201d of dahlia plants a season, each given just enough real estate to accommodate the tomato cage supporting it. The goal: an abundant flower harvest.",
      "\u201cBecause my garden functions as a cutting garden, I just use the tomato cages, and they go cheek by jowl,\u201d she said.",
      "The plants fill two large, fenced garden areas: four 16-by-16-foot beds in one space and 30 raised beds of four-by-eight feet or longer atop an old tennis court, where she also keeps several beehives.",
      "And it\u2019s not just dahlias she grows to cut.",
      "\u201cI have all sorts of things happening,\u201d she said, ticking off a flowering cascade from spring bulbs to sweet peas, annual poppies and natives like asters and ironweed (Vernonia) that peak simultaneously with the dahlias. \u201cBut the dahlias always get the best \u2014 and the most \u2014 real estate, and everything else gets pushed in between. It\u2019s quite chaotic.\u201d",
      "Visitors to her annual Garden Conservancy Open Day (this year, it\u2019s ",
      ") don\u2019t seem to mind.",
      "Everything appears in delightful excess, unfolding toward \u201ca great crescendo in the garden,\u201d from the time the dahlias get going, by mid-July or so, right through till frost says stop and those cardboard boxes get loaded up again.",
      "Most of us will never try growing \u201chundreds\u201d of dahlias \u2014 even over many seasons. There are almost 11,000 named dahlias on the American Dahlia Society\u2019s composite list of varieties, from 1976 to the present; international groups list even more. The largest source in the United States, Swan Island Dahlias, carries more than 400.",
      "So which ones should we seek out?",
      "It\u2019s a topic that Ms. Palmer, who also recommends Ferncliff Gardens, Old House Gardens and Queen Valley Farm as sources, covers with students at the New York Botanical Garden in the Dauntless Dahlias course she has taught every March and October since 2015.",
      "\u201cThink abstractly versus specifically,\u201d she advises. Consider which colors, shapes and forms you prefer \u2014 and what scale.",
      "Don\u2019t obsess over the names of the dahlias, because if you can\u2019t find them, it\u2019s really irrelevant,\u201d she tells her students as she projects images of outstanding examples. \u201cYou can find something that looks kind of along the same lines. If you want a pink cactus dahlia, it doesn\u2019t have to be the particular one that I\u2019m showing you.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have favorites. Pressed to name names, she does: yellow, peony-shaped Meadowburn Old Tweet, for instance, and Juanita, a six-inch-across cactus type in rich red. Also Cafe au Lait, the palest peach or barely pink, which is often used in weddings.",
      "Some are extra-flashy, like Bodacious (big, bright orange petals with yellow undersides), Myrtle\u2019s Brandy (distinctive, reflexed red petals with white tips) and Deuil du Roi Albert (purple tipped in white). Bishop of Llandaff has screaming, semidouble scarlet flowers and dark purple foliage.",
      "The list goes on. She always makes room for flowers of velvety black-red (maybe giant Spartacus or smaller Paul Smith) and \u201ca good orange\u201d (Clyde\u2019s Choice can reach a foot across). Pink (perhaps the massive Otto\u2019s Thrill) and white (Walter Hardisty, another big guy) are also musts. At least one color \u2014 yellow, which she once disliked \u2014 has grown on her thanks to her relationship with dahlias.",
      "In each hue, she said, she seeks a range of shapes and sometimes shades, \u201cso that when I\u2019m putting them together in arrangement, you\u2019ve got some nice diversity of form and color and size. If you have a little bit of everything, it\u2019s so easy to put together something that looks abundant.\u201d",
      "Homegrown zinnias and marigolds are among the other ingredients in that abundance; so are copper fennel, nasturtiums and even strands of clematis vine.",
      "One simplifying tactic she suggests if you want get started: Shop according to a color or shape theme.",
      "\u201cIf you like yellow, just get yellow dahlias that are pompons or decorative or cactus,\u201d she said, \u201cso that you have a variation of shape and form. Even if you decided to just do ball dahlias one year, and only had all different colors or sizes of ball dahlias, you would have a fabulous garden.\u201d",
      "Except in Zones 8 to 10, where they are perennials, dahlias tubers are planted outside like annuals, around tomato-transplant time. Ms. Palmer plants hers in mid-May, around Mother\u2019s Day.",
      "There is no room in a greenhouse or under lights to pot up all of those overwintered tubers for a head start, but new mail-order purchases tend to arrive well before it\u2019s safe to put them outdoors and may dry out if left in their boxes. She pots those up, or at least stashes them in a tray of potting soil.",
      "In May, each tomato cage from her giant collection is called into service, gridded out in the gardens along with a stake or two to reinforce it. Beneath each one, a tuber is planted so that an inch or two of soil covers it. A tag marked with the dahlia\u2019s name is tied onto the cage.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing about planting a dahlia tuber is getting your support system in place immediately,\u201d Ms. Palmer said. As the plants grow, she uses biodegradable jute twine for further support, and maybe another stake for the tallest ones. Where cages may look out of place, you can use just bamboo stakes and twine.",
      "Also important: When the first stem pushes up six to 12 inches high, Ms. Palmer pinches the center bud to promote bushiness.",
      "A second pinch, or disbudding, can encourage long stems for cutting. As the plants get ready to produce flowers later on, they form three buds at the end of each branch; pinch off the outer two in each group. Ms. Palmer repeats this as the plants continue to set flowers.",
      "Every couple of weeks throughout the summer, she dilutes fish emulsion with water in a two-gallon sprayer, and \u201cthe roses, the tomatoes, the dahlias \u2014 everybody gets a spray, all over the garden,\u201d she said.",
      "And on they grow, until the first frost. Ideally, Ms. Palmer waits till a week or two after it blackens the plants, and then cuts them back and digs them out. But sometimes frost comes so late she has to dig before it arrives.",
      "She brushes off clods of soil and spreads the tubers out to cure in the barn for a week or so. Then she cuts the stems to maybe two or three inches long, packs the tubers into her cartons with a wood-shaving material from the farm store labeled as horse bedding, and back they go into the cellar.",
      "Oh, but wait: There\u2019s one more step. Don\u2019t forget to tie the tag on the tuber\u2019s stem before you put it away \u2014 if you can keep the exhumed darlings straight, that is.",
      "\u201cAnd I do try,\u201d Ms. Palmer said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a Kafkaesque exercise to tag the tubers with names after I cure them. Thankfully, I don\u2019t really care at the end of the day.\u201d",

      "As the real estate market in Melbourne, Australia, sizzled and home prices surged in 2017, Chris Calleja and Joy Suemag were scrambling to find a larger house for their young family.",
      "\u201cProperty was hot, so you had to be brave and go in and bid at auction,\u201d said Mr. Calleja, 47, who works in finance at the Ford Motor Company. \u201cYou\u2019re going to all these places and losing, losing, losing.\u201d",
      "So when he and Ms. Suemag, also 47 and a marketing and sales professional at Ford, found a 1950s house in the Melbourne suburb of Alphington, which they liked for its proximity to work, school, stores and restaurants, they didn\u2019t hesitate \u2014 although it was far from perfect.",
      "\u201cIt was run-down and would have been cheaper to demolish than fix up,\u201d Mr. Calleja said. \u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s buy it and tear it down.\u2019\u201d",
      "At least, that was the plan. After striking a deal to buy the house for 1.7 million Australian dollars (about $1.1 million), they and their children \u2014 Mali, now 11, and Mark, 9 \u2014 moved in temporarily and began looking for an architect.",
      "Once they had unpacked, they noticed one big problem right away, beyond the poor insulation and the possums living in the roof: The primary living spaces in the back of the house and the backyard were dark, while the front of the house got sun all day long.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to have a lot of light, and in Australia that means a lot of northern sun,\u201d Mr. Calleja said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got street frontage on the north and want to have all your windows there, you have privacy concerns.\u201d",
      "Creating an internal courtyard was one possible solution. Searching online, the couple found ",
      ", a Melbourne-based architecture studio that had recently designed a striking courtyard house nearby.",
      "When Adi Atic and Michael Artemenko, the founders of FIGR, visited the 0.16-acre lot, they agreed that building a house with a courtyard would help. But they also thought they could do better than simply replace the old house with a new one. Looking at how the backyard was hemmed in by other houses, Mr. Artemenko said, the architects asked themselves: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we flip this on its head and do the front yard as the backyard?\u201d",
      "By pushing the new house as far back as the lot-line setback requirement would allow, they could create a more generous, light-filled yard in front. But privacy would still be an issue, and neither the owners nor their architects wanted to put up a big fence.",
      "That\u2019s when Mr. Atic and Mr. Artemenko remembered learning about the concept of a ha-ha in architecture school: a sunken fence used in 18th-century landscapes that was concealed from view. \u201cBasically, it looks like a ditch, and it prevented livestock from going in the garden area,\u201d Mr. Atic said.",
      "The architects turned this idea on its head, too: Rather than digging a ditch, they would build a landscaped earthen mound near the sidewalk, blocking sightlines from the street and creating a garden-like feeling in the yard.",
      "For the house, they designed a 2,750-square-foot, single-story structure that runs in a circle around a central courtyard and oversized glass doors that open entire walls to the outdoors. For cladding, they chose slender white brick and charred silvertop ash that run from the exterior into interior rooms, reinforcing the sense of indoor-outdoor living.",
      "Once the plans were set, the family moved into a rental down the street as demolition of the old house and construction of the new one began in July 2020. They had already ordered most of their building materials at the beginning of the pandemic, before supply-chain issues snarled other construction projects, so their new home was complete in November 2021 at a cost of about 1.5 million Australian dollars (about $990,000).",
      "The kitchen, dining area and living room are at the front of the house, taking advantage of the northern light and views of the expanded front garden. In the middle of the house are two bedrooms for the children on one side of the courtyard and a home office on the other. The primary bedroom is at the back, along with an additional sitting room and a gym; all have views of the rear garden, where the old backyard used to be.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in this property, you feel very secluded; you feel like you\u2019re in the country,\u201d Mr. Atic said. \u201cYou see greenery everywhere, even though you\u2019re five minutes from the city.\u201d",
      "The windows around the courtyard help the family stay connected. \u201cWe can see the kids from the kitchen, through the courtyard,\u201d Ms. Suemag said, so they don\u2019t need to call out to find each other. \u201cThat\u2019s probably my favorite thing.\u201d",
      "The reimagined front yard has also been embraced by the family \u2014 including their golden Labrador, Mellow, who keeps her distance from the earthen mound. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t climb the ha-ha,\u201d Mr. Calleja said. \u201cShe did once, when it was being constructed, but we arranged the boulders so she couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Much like the 18th-century ha-ha that kept farm animals where they were supposed to be, this 21st-century version has proved useful for restraining an urban pet. \u201cIt does the job,\u201d Mr. Calleja said.",

The defendant, Justin H., whose surname is protected by Germany\u2019s strict privacy laws, was too stunned to react other than to nod.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller is famous in Germany for his relentless criticism of the law criminalizing cannabis possession.

      "Part of his anger arises both from the frequency of cannabis arrests \u2014 181,000 on minor possession or use charges in 2021 \u2014 and the billions of euros spent enforcing what he said was the \u201cabsurd\u201d law against getting high.",
      "In 2020, Judge M\u00fcller wrote the first complaint to Germany\u2019s highest constitutional court, asking it to overturn the cannabis law. Other judges followed, and the court is now reviewing 10 drug cases sent by three different courts in Germany.",
      "\u201cFor young people like us, it\u2019s pretty inspiring to have someone from an older generation, who is a judge, advocate for a thing that maybe goes against conventional opinion,\u201d said the rapper GReeeN, 33, who often sings favorably about cannabis. \u201cIt\u2019s important \u2014 we need people like him for change.\u201d",
      "GReeeN, whose real name is Pasquale Denefleh, knows the judge from a video they made together. The judge, playing himself, raps about the evils of cannabis prohibition. \u201cSmoking weed is not criminal; smoking weed is normal,\u201d he sings.",
      "The German government has begun taking the judge\u2019s side in the cannabis debate just as the judge, 61, is preparing to retire from the bench.",
      "In mid-April, Karl Lauterbach, the country\u2019s health minister, presented a plan legalizing cannabis for personal use; in the coming months, a more comprehensive plan that would eventually legalize and tax the sale of cannabis is expected to be proposed.",
      "After years of a conservative-run government, the new center-left coalition under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, has signaled it is likely to approve the proposal, which would make Germany the first European country where not only the possession but also the public sale of cannabis is not just decriminalized, but legalized.",
      "Although the changes to the law would have come without his help, Judge M\u00fcller and others believe he played a small part in the overhaul.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that he was instrumental in showing that demands for reform were not just coming from the cannabis community, but from a more established perspective, too,\u201d said Ates G\u00fcrpinar, a member of Parliament and the drug policy spokesman for the far-left Die Linke party, which supports legalizing cannabis.",
      "Before the coalition\u2019s latest plan was announced, Judge M\u00fcller had threatened to organize street protests to put pressure on the government.",
      "That pugnaciousness is a signature part of the judge\u2019s style.",
      "\u201cBecause of his rough edges, he\u2019s not just well-known, he\u2019s also feared,\u201d Mr. G\u00fcrpinar said. \u201cHe will just fire off things even if he knows that it could irritate potential allies.\u201d",
      "Judges in Germany wield a lot of power in their courtrooms, but with a few exceptions \u2014 like a judge ",
      " last December \u2014 they tend to stay out of the political fray.",
      "Not so Judge M\u00fcller, who regularly gets into spats on Twitter, where he has 60,000 followers. He also is the deputy director of the German chapter of LEAP, or Law Enforcement Action Partnership, a cannabis advocacy group run by law-enforcement officers, lawyers and politicians.",
      "Some law-enforcement officials say the judge does not\u00a0sufficiently separate his activism from his day job. In 2020 the local district attorney\u2019s office applied to have him recused from hearing cannabis cases. Ricarda B\u00f6hme, a prosecutor, said in an interview that given \u201cthe objective overall view of his public statements\u201d the judge could in \u201cno way be able to reach an unbiased decision\u201d on such matters.",
      "But a higher court ruled for the judge and he was able to continue hearing those cases.",
      "Judge M\u00fcller was born in the town of Meppen in Lower Saxony. His father, traumatized by his experience as an 18-year-old soldier in World War II, drank himself to death when the judge was 11. His brother spent time in jail on a drug charge and died young. Judge M\u00fcller was the first member of his extended family to graduate from high school.",
      "\u201cIt was a present to my mother,\u201d he said about his career choice.",
      "Starting in Bernau as a judge in 1997, Judge M\u00fcller was part of a generation of judges from the former West Germany who came to the former East Germany to help modernize and democratize the judicial system after the collapse of communism.",
      "For all the leniency he has shown in cannabis trials, he has a reputation as an unsparing judge in other cases.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve sent quite a few people to prison,\u201d he said. A tabloid started calling him \u201cJudge Merciless\u201d until he threatened legal action.",
      "Before he became known for his advocacy on cannabis, Judge M\u00fcller was feared among far-right youths for his aggressive stance on prosecuting neo-Nazis.",
      "For a while he declared a specific footwear worn as an identification marker by German neo-Nazi skinheads \u2014 the Dr. Martens 16-eyelet boot with white shoelaces \u2014 a weapon in his courtroom, forcing visitors and witnesses who came wearing the boots to appear in socks. He gave conditional sentences that forced right-wing youth to visit mosques and share meals with immigrants from inner-city districts. He had people visit concentration camps and write essays. He meted out prison sentences for first offenses.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an activist in some ways and has been committed to liberal drug policies for years, but when it comes to other offenses, he\u2019s also known as a strict and uncompromising judge,\u201d said Hasso Suliak, lawyer and an editor at Legal Tribune Online, a German legal news site, who has followed Judge M\u00fcller\u2019s court cases.",
      "All this has made the judge at least a minor celebrity, especially in\u00a0Bernau bei Berlin. A recent packed day of trials in Bernau had to be delayed because Judge M\u00fcller heard a local electrician wanted to meet him.",
      "When he found his admirer, he gave him his latest calling card: a package of cigarette rolling paper with the judge\u2019s own image emblazed on one side and the words \u201clegalize it\u201d printed on the side.",

      "Dan-o McShane, as the former U.S. Navy officer is known, had been stationed in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea for six years. Like the rest of the world, he learned of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to meet Mr. Kim in the DMZ on Twitter \u2014 only a day before the meeting was to take place.",
      "Suddenly, the lieutenant commander was thrust into making frantic preparations, his retirement plans scuppered.",
      "\u201cThat started a whole 24-hour communication event that would result in multiple messages passed overnight,\u201d said Commander McShane, who was the American-led United Nations Command\u2019s top military officer at the border in the village of Panmunjom at the time.",
      "\u201cI lay down on the couch for a minute and then at 4 a.m., North Korea would call because they\u2019re working just as hard on their side because Kim Jong-un\u2019s going to come down to them and that\u2019s probably a bigger cult of personality than the Donald Trump cult of personality.\u201d",

      "Each side has since assigned a joint duty officer\u200b at Panmunjom to help enforce the cease-fire. On the U.N. side, an American Navy officer has typically served a year or two under the U.N. flag. Commander McShane served for a record eight years, from 2013 to 2021, becoming the longest-serving U.N. joint duty officer at Panmunjom in history. He now teaches guitar to wounded American veterans at Camp Humphreys, south of Seoul, as part of a program sponsored by the American Red Cross and the Wounded Warrior Project.",
      "During that time, he faced off with North Korean troops, prepped for the Trump-Kim summit, saw tensions ebb and flow with the political mood and witnessed some of the most \u200bhair-raising \u2014 and \u200bbizarre \u2014 moments \u200bat the DMZ, the world\u2019s most heavily armed border.",
      "His first night on the job, a land mine exploded nearby. The next night, two went off. Soon, he stopped registering them; the DMZ is strewn with two million land mines. Animals step on them all of the time. It was \u201ca bit of a culture shock,\u201d Commander McShane recalled.",
      "Twice a day \u2014 at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. \u2014 he rang his North Korean\u00a0counterpart on a peach-colored phone the U.N. Command operated to ensure that the hotline was open.\u200b The messages were usually mundane: \u201cWe\u2019re trimming the grass over here. Don\u2019t shoot us!\u201d he said.",
      "Some U.S. soldiers in Panmunjom liked to call themselves the \u201cMerry Mad Monks of the DMZ\u201d because serving in such an isolated, off-limits spot was like living in a monastery. They organized cookouts and teed off at \u201c",

      "Unfamiliar with Navy abbreviations like LCDR, for lieutenant commander, Army soldiers stationed at the DMZ nicknamed Commander McShane \u201cthe Lord Commander,\u201d a reference to the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "He remembered once spotting a white dog ambling around Panmunjom. He fed and played with it for two weeks until it trotted across the demarcation line\u200b\u200b, \u201clike he\u2019s done it 1,000 times.\u201d",
      "The dog went up the stairs of the gray Stalinist building on the North Korean side. A soldier opened the door and the dog walked right in, never to be seen again. \u201cThe joke was, of course, that he\u2019s a spy,\u201d Commander McShane said.",
      "At Panmunjom, North Korean and U.S. officers occasionally meet in person, even talking baseball. The North Koreans loved Doritos and South Korean Choco Pies, Commander McShane said. The U.N. officers also brought Marlboro cigarettes and Johnnie Walker whiskey as gifts.",

His translator hid behind a brick wall until she had to repeat the message in Korean.",

      "The Navy kept extending Commander McShane\u2019s tour because it had difficulty finding a qualified replacement. A joint duty officer at Panmunjom must be a lieutenant commander with a master\u2019s degree in East Asian studies and rigorous Korean language training. On the day of the Trump-Kim summit, the Navy extended his tour for the fifth time.",

      "\u201cTienen un buen espacio\u201d, le dijo el papa, trazando un cuadrado con las manos durante una audiencia privada el mes pasado, al reverendo Andrew Small, quien gestiona la comisi\u00f3n del papa para combatir los abusos sexuales. \u201c\u00bfYa se mudaron?\u201d.",
      "Desde que Francisco cre\u00f3 la Comisi\u00f3n Pontificia para la Protecci\u00f3n de Menores en 2014, el personal ocupaba, y desbordaba, una antigua residencia del Vaticano cerca del apartamento del papa. Si bien la ubicaci\u00f3n al principio suger\u00eda una proximidad al poder, en la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada la comisi\u00f3n ha visto c\u00f3mo su influencia se ha erosionado debido a los intereses arraigados del Vaticano y las deserciones. Small dijo que su personal deb\u00eda tomar prestadas oficinas en la Santa Sede \u201ccomo beduinos\u201d cuando los obispos se reun\u00edan con ellos. Coment\u00f3 que para los sobrevivientes de abusos era dif\u00edcil encontrar su rinc\u00f3n escondido.",
      "As\u00ed que en a\u00f1os recientes, la comisi\u00f3n busc\u00f3, sin aspavientos, un cambio, aunque fuera un cambio de direcci\u00f3n, para reafirmar lo importante que es para la Iglesia proteger a los ni\u00f1os. La b\u00fasqueda de un lugar termin\u00f3 el mes pasado, cuando la comisi\u00f3n se hizo del control de unas oficinas libre de renta en un majestuoso ",

      "La comisi\u00f3n asegura que las nuevas oficinas, de las que hasta ahora no se hab\u00eda informado, en el Palazzo Maffei Marescotti, que se encuentra a unos pasos del Pante\u00f3n, revelan un compromiso concreto con las v\u00edctimas y una clara respuesta a algunas fuerzas del Vaticano que, en su opini\u00f3n, preferir\u00edan que el tema de los abusos sexuales permaneciera oculto o distante.",
      "Lejos de ser un exilio, Small defini\u00f3 el traslado como una expansi\u00f3n hacia una sede mundial en Roma que pueda servir de monumento a \u201cla masacre silenciosa de la infancia de las personas\u201d y dejarles claro a los sobrevivientes que \u201ctienen derecho a estar en un lugar hermoso\u201d.",
      "\u201cEs muy significativo\u201d, dijo en una entrevista Sean O\u2019Malley, arzobispo de Boston y presidente de la comisi\u00f3n.",

O\u2019Malley coment\u00f3 que los sobrevivientes de abusos sexuales por parte de cl\u00e9rigos a menudo se sienten inc\u00f3modos al entrar en una iglesia cat\u00f3lica: \u201cTener que entrar en el Vaticano y pasar por la Guardia Suiza y los gendarmes y todo lo dem\u00e1s puede ser bastante intimidante\u201d.",
      "La ubicaci\u00f3n dista de ser el \u00fanico problema de la comisi\u00f3n. Durante d\u00e9cadas, la Iglesia ha estado polarizada en torno a la asignaci\u00f3n de responsabilidad de su jerarqu\u00eda a la hora de encubrir abusos, a la voz que debe darse a las v\u00edctimas dentro de una instituci\u00f3n herm\u00e9tica y a la conveniencia de adoptar un enfoque m\u00e1s gradual o contundente hacia una reforma.",
      "Francisco anunci\u00f3 la creaci\u00f3n de la comisi\u00f3n en 2013, en medio de preocupaciones de que no tomaba en serio el tema, pero su funci\u00f3n termin\u00f3 siendo solo de consultor\u00eda. Los comisionados, entre los que hab\u00eda algunos sobrevivientes, acabaron renunciando en se\u00f1al de protesta, y acusaron al Vaticano de obstruccionismo.",
      "Con o sin oficinas nuevas, la inestabilidad no ha terminado. El mes pasado, Hans Zollner, jesuita alem\u00e1n, quien tal vez sea el mayor experto de la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica en la lucha contra los abusos y el miembro m\u00e1s destacado de la comisi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n renunci\u00f3.",

      "Cuando se le pregunt\u00f3 al cardenal si pensaba que Zollner, de quien algunos de los miembros de la comisi\u00f3n sospechaban que estaba intentando crear un centro de protecci\u00f3n de menores paralelo en una universidad pontificia romana, intentaba sabotear la comisi\u00f3n, respondi\u00f3: \u201cA estas alturas, no s\u00e9 lo que piensa\u201d (Zollner no respondi\u00f3 a una solicitud de comentarios).",
      "O\u2019Malley prefiri\u00f3 hablar sobre la apertura de las nuevas oficinas de protecci\u00f3n en Sudam\u00e9rica y de las nuevas medidas de rendici\u00f3n de cuentas que Francisco consagr\u00f3 en la legislaci\u00f3n eclesi\u00e1stica el mes pasado.",

      "Muchas veces se top\u00f3 con una actitud de rechazo t\u00edpica de la actitud \u201cNIMBY\u201d (acr\u00f3nimo en ingl\u00e9s de \u201cNo en mi patio trasero\u201d), en la que los propietarios de las iglesias ve\u00edan a la comisi\u00f3n \u201ccomo una cl\u00ednica de metadona\u201d.",

      "En 2021, Small se encontr\u00f3 con el Palazzo Maffei Marescotti, una propiedad de la Santa Sede fuera del Vaticano que alberga oficinas de caridad, una oficina de correos y la oficina de peregrinaje de la Iglesia. El exdirector de esa oficina, monse\u00f1or Liberio Andreatta, quien est\u00e1 a cargo del edificio, vive en el palazzo y es una figura con buenos contactos y conocida en los c\u00edrculos clericales y pol\u00edticos romanos por su amplia cartera inmobiliaria.",

      "Small coment\u00f3 que el equivalente de la alcald\u00eda para la Ciudad del Vaticano tambi\u00e9n le dijo a la comisi\u00f3n que se olvidara de los planes de expansi\u00f3n en las oficinas que ten\u00eda en el Vaticano y les inform\u00f3 que tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan ser desalojados para brindarle espacio a los cardenales que necesitaran alojamiento en caso de que se celebrara un c\u00f3nclave para elegir al pr\u00f3ximo papa (el Vaticano declin\u00f3 hacer comentarios).",
      "Al final, Small afirm\u00f3 que su insistencia y la carta de O\u2019Malley hicieron que Andreatta accediera mostrarles unas peque\u00f1as habitaciones en la azotea del palazzo que Small describi\u00f3 como \u201crepletas de palomas\u201d.",

      "El grave desabastecimiento de combustible oblig\u00f3 a las autoridades cubanas a cancelar el muy celebrado desfile del D\u00eda Internacional de los Trabajadores, que se hab\u00eda fijado para el lunes. El evento generalmente atrae a cientos de miles de personas vestidas de rojo, ondeando banderas y pancartas en apoyo del socialismo y la Revoluci\u00f3n cubana.",
      "Pero este 1 de mayo, la Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n en La Habana \u2014en la que se erige una estatua gigante del h\u00e9roe nacional de la isla, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed\u2014 no se parecer\u00e1 en nada a esa imagen.",
      "En las \u00faltimas semanas, Cuba ha tenido problemas con la escasez de combustible en toda la isla causada por los proveedores extranjeros que no est\u00e1n cumpliendo sus compromisos, seg\u00fan ha dicho su presidente. La econom\u00eda debilitada del pa\u00eds tambi\u00e9n ha dificultado que el gobierno importe sus propios diluyentes para refinar el crudo de baja calidad que recibe o para comprar crudo de mayor calidad que requiere menos refinaci\u00f3n.",
      "Cuba suele consumir entre 500 y 600 toneladas diarias de combustible, se\u00f1al\u00f3 a principios de este mes el presidente Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel. Ahora, dijo, la isla tiene menos de 400 toneladas al d\u00eda.",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel dijo que todav\u00eda no est\u00e1 claro \u201cc\u00f3mo vamos a lograr los empates para salir de esta situaci\u00f3n\u201d.",
      "Aunque el principal evento del 1 de mayo en la capital ha sido cancelado, Ulises Guilarte, secretario general de la Central de Trabajadores de Cuba, dijo la semana pasada que las celebraciones a\u00fan se llevar\u00edan a cabo en las comunidades locales, escuelas y lugares de trabajo bajo condiciones de \u201cm\u00e1xima austeridad\u201d.",
      "Sin embargo, dadas las fuertes lluvias y vientos en Cuba el domingo, incluso algunos de estos eventos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os pueden terminar tambi\u00e9n pospuestos.",
      "Durante el \u00faltimo mes, los cubanos han experimentado una grave escasez de combustible que ha paralizado la econom\u00eda de la isla, que ya estaba sufriendo.",
      "El tr\u00e1fico se ha detenido. Han surgido filas de m\u00e1s de un kil\u00f3metro de largo en las gasolineras, en donde algunos conductores duermen en sus autos. Los taxistas cobran tarifas exorbitantes. Algunas universidades han vuelto a las clases en l\u00ednea. Los restaurantes y bares han ido perdiendo clientes. Hasta el Teatro Nacional de Cuba en La Habana cancel\u00f3 un concierto de la Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Nacional por falta de combustible.",
      "Ahora Cuba ha cancelado el desfile del 1 de mayo.",
      "La \u00faltima vez que se cancel\u00f3 el desfile fue en el punto \u00e1lgido de la pandemia de coronavirus en 2021.",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel ha negado que la crisis sea el resultado de las ineficiencias de Cuba o de las instituciones estatales. En cambio, la ha atribuido a pa\u00edses, como Venezuela, uno de sus proveedores de combustible desde hace mucho tiempo, que \u201cno han podido cumplir sus compromisos\u201d porque \u201chan estado tambi\u00e9n en una situaci\u00f3n energ\u00e9tica compleja\u201d, dijo.",
      "Este no es el primer desabastecimiento de combustible en Cuba. Pero sin una salida a la vista, los analistas y residentes temen que podr\u00eda ser uno de los peores.",
      "En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, la combinaci\u00f3n de sanciones estadounidenses m\u00e1s estrictas y la pandemia debilitaron uno de los sustentos m\u00e1s vitales de Cuba: la industria del turismo. Los alimentos se han vuelto a\u00fan m\u00e1s escasos y m\u00e1s caros, las filas en las farmacias con pocos suministros comienzan antes del amanecer y millones de personas sufren apagones de horas cada d\u00eda.",
      "Desde inicios de 2022, m\u00e1s de 330.000 cubanos han migrado a Estados Unidos, la mayor\u00eda de ellos a trav\u00e9s de la frontera sur por v\u00eda terrestre, seg\u00fan datos del ",
      "En a\u00f1os anteriores, los trabajadores en La Habana habr\u00edan estado instalando andamios y pantallas en preparaci\u00f3n para el desfile. El domingo, sin embargo, la Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n luc\u00eda desierta. Solo un pu\u00f1ado de autos estaban estacionados all\u00ed: un mural del Che Guevara mir\u00e1ndolos a trav\u00e9s de la lluvia. Uno de ellos era un Chevrolet convertible negro de 1959.",
      "\u201cHay poco trabajo porque hay poco turismo, y en realidad no puedes trabajar mucho porque tienes que ahorrar el combustible\u201d, dijo Yosvel Sosa Vargas, de 37 a\u00f1os, quien alquila el Chevrolet y trabaja como chofer de turistas.",
      "Sosa Vargas dijo que no participar\u00e1 en las celebraciones.",

      "Desde su natal Rumania hasta un intento fallido de solicitud de asilo en B\u00e9lgica y despu\u00e9s un divorcio y dificultades econ\u00f3micas, la enfermedad de Iosif ha exacerbado crisis de su vida que casi siempre se han salido de control.",
      "Sin embargo, sentado a la mesa del comedor por cuyas puertas de cristal se ve el bosque, parec\u00eda tranquilo.",
      "Hablaba acerca de sus labores cotidianas (alimentar al burro, lavar los trastes), sus pasatiempos preferidos (leer la Biblia, ir de compras), sus preocupaciones (olvidarse de tomar las pastillas, gastar m\u00e1s de la cuenta).",
      "En la sala de estar, los sonidos de los dibujos animados llenaban el ambiente. Etty, de 71 a\u00f1os, y Luc Hayen, de 75, estaban fascinados viendo un programa infantil de un rat\u00f3n en una descabellada aventura. En un sof\u00e1 color crema hab\u00eda un gato acurrucado.",
      "Todos ellos viven con Ann Peetermans, una cosmet\u00f3loga de 47 a\u00f1os, y su hijo adolescente, gracias a un acuerdo a largo plazo mediante el cual personas con enfermedades mentales se mudan con familias de la localidad.",
      "Se trata de un tipo de atenci\u00f3n psiqui\u00e1trica que, de acuerdo con los archivos, ha existido en Geel desde el siglo XIII. A mediados del siglo XIV, los lugare\u00f1os empezaron a construir una iglesia para Santa Dimpna, la santa patrona de los enfermos mentales, y la llegada de peregrinos a Geel no se hizo esperar. Se alojaban en las granjas de los campesinos de la localidad, donde trabajaban la tierra al lado de sus nuevas familias.",
      "Tanto la iglesia como esa tradici\u00f3n siguen en pie.",
      "Para finales del siglo XIX, casi 2000 hu\u00e9spedes viv\u00edan con los habitantes de Geel. En la actualidad, este pueblo de 41.000 habitantes en Flandes, la regi\u00f3n de B\u00e9lgica donde se habla neerland\u00e9s, alberga 120 hu\u00e9spedes en las casas de los lugare\u00f1os.",
      "Eso ha convertido a Geel tanto en un modelo de un prototipo diferente de tratamiento psiqui\u00e1trico como en un caso at\u00edpico, el cual ha tendido a generar desconfianza a lo largo de los siglos (hasta The New York Times en un ",

      "Esa desconfianza no hizo m\u00e1s que aumentar cuando el modelo de Geel choc\u00f3 con la psiquiatr\u00eda, un campo de la medicina que estaba en constante desarrollo. Sin embargo, en \u00e9pocas m\u00e1s recientes, la ciudad ha sido reconsiderada como el s\u00edmbolo de una alternativa compasiva al abandono o la reclusi\u00f3n que se destina en otros lugares para quienes padecen alguna enfermedad mental.",
      "\u201cSiempre ha habido pol\u00e9mica con respecto a c\u00f3mo se debe tratar a las personas \u2018exc\u00e9ntricas\u2019 o \u2018trastornadas\u2019\u201d, escribi\u00f3 en 2007 el destacado neur\u00f3logo Oliver Sacks en su pr\u00f3logo al libro ",

      "\u201c\u00bfSe les debe tratar como personas enfermas y tal vez peligrosas que deben estar recluidas en instituciones psiqui\u00e1tricas?\u201d, escribi\u00f3 Sacks, fallecido en 2015. \u201c\u00bfO tal vez tambi\u00e9n tenga \u00e9xito un enfoque m\u00e1s humano y social que intente reintegrarlas a una familia y a la vida de la comunidad, a una vida de amor y trabajo?\u201d.",
      "Para Sacks, quien hab\u00eda visitado Geel, la respuesta era aceptar la enfermedad mental como una particularidad individual y no como una discapacidad estigmatizante.",
      "Sacks concluy\u00f3 que Geel es la prueba de que \u201cincluso quienes podr\u00edan parecer enfermos incurables tienen la posibilidad de vivir una vida plena y digna, con amor y seguridad\u201d.",
      "Cuando Peetermans era ni\u00f1a en Geel, su t\u00eda hospedaba personas con enfermedades mentales. Eso era algo normal para los lugare\u00f1os, coment\u00f3.",

      "Para Hayen, este es el tercer hogar de acogida en casi 30 a\u00f1os, y dice que se lleva bien con los dem\u00e1s hu\u00e9spedes, Etty (\u201cuna buena mujer\u201d) y Iosif (\u201ctodo un caballero\u201d).",
      "\u201cAqu\u00ed tengo una vida incre\u00edble\u201d, dijo Hayen con entusiasmo. \u201cPorque lo que yo busco es libertad, al igual que casi todo el mundo\u201d.",
      "Nos cont\u00f3 que lo siguiente que quer\u00eda hacer era conseguir una bicicleta usada para ir al centro de actividades que est\u00e1 junto al hospital psiqui\u00e1trico, donde disfruta sus pasatiempos entre semana.",
      "El Times est\u00e1 identificando y fotografiando a los hu\u00e9spedes y a sus familias de acogida seg\u00fan sus deseos y, durante este reportaje, un psic\u00f3logo acompa\u00f1\u00f3 a los periodistas del Times.",
      "Desde la d\u00e9cada de 1860, Geel ha tenido su propio hospital psiqui\u00e1trico estatal, el cual es el eje y la red de seguridad de este programa.",
      "Wilfried Bogaerts, uno de los psic\u00f3logos principales de ah\u00ed, se\u00f1al\u00f3 que encontrar pacientes para el programa de hogares de acogida no ten\u00eda que ver tanto con su diagn\u00f3stico, sino m\u00e1s bien con qu\u00e9 tan estables eran sus trastornos. Entre los hu\u00e9spedes hay personas con esquizofrenia u otros tipos de psicosis grave, pero que siguen un tratamiento y son capaces de ser funcionales dentro de una familia.",
      "Se realiza un emparejamiento de los posibles hu\u00e9spedes con familias que ya han sido evaluadas y cuyos hogares han sido aprobados para hospedar a alguien.",
      "A las familias de acogida nunca se les revela el diagn\u00f3stico, a menos que el hu\u00e9sped quiera compartirlo. Los trabajadores sociales se enfocan m\u00e1s bien en preparar a las familias para el tipo de comportamientos que deben esperar, el r\u00e9gimen de medicaci\u00f3n y las se\u00f1ales de alerta que deben notificar de inmediato.",
      "Algo fundamental para la confianza en este acuerdo es que hay trabajadores sociales disponibles las 24 horas del d\u00eda en el hospital cercano.",
      "\u201cEl cuidado en hogares de acogida es un tratamiento psiqui\u00e1trico, lo cual implica que todo el personal que se puede encontrar en un hospital psiqui\u00e1trico t\u00edpico participa en el tratamiento del hogar de acogida\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Bogaerts.",
      "El gobierno de B\u00e9lgica les proporciona a las familias de acogida una remuneraci\u00f3n de 23 a 28 euros (25-30 d\u00f3lares) al d\u00eda por cada hu\u00e9sped, cantidad que, a decir de todos, no es suficiente.",
      "Adem\u00e1s, el programa se ha estado reduciendo de manera constante en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, pero tanto la comunidad local como el hospital est\u00e1n tratando de revertir esa tendencia. Hace poco, B\u00e9lgica present\u00f3 una solicitud para que la UNESCO, la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Educaci\u00f3n, la Ciencia y la Cultura, reconozca el programa de hogares de acogida de Geel como un \u201cpatrimonio cultural intangible\u201d. Los responsables del programa tambi\u00e9n han puesto en marcha una campa\u00f1a publicitaria para que m\u00e1s familias quieran ofrecer hogares de acogida.",
      "\u201cCreo que es importante que mis nietos, por ejemplo, aprendan a vivir con personas que sufren esos trastornos\u201d, coment\u00f3 Greet Vandeperre, de 66 a\u00f1os, quien encabeza un grupo comunitario que representa a las familias de acogida, a los hu\u00e9spedes, al hospital, al pueblo y a la polic\u00eda.",
      "Para muchos, los hu\u00e9spedes se convierten en familia. Los nietos peque\u00f1os de Ingrid Daems y Hugo Vanopstal conocen a Janina Bak, la hu\u00e9sped de sus abuelos durante 18 a\u00f1os, solo como \u201ct\u00eda Nina\u201d. No est\u00e1n seguros de c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n emparentados exactamente, pero en visitas semanales a lo largo de sus vidas, se han sentado en su regazo, comido con ella y celebrado con ella.",
      "Cuando Bak se enferm\u00f3 gravemente con un problema hep\u00e1tico, pas\u00f3 nueve semanas en coma y un total de cuatro meses en el hospital, Daems estuvo all\u00ed para ayudarla a superarlo y darle la bienvenida de regreso a casa.",
      "\u201cElla es mi \u00e1ngel guardi\u00e1n\u201d, dijo.",
      "La trayectoria de varias d\u00e9cadas que Vandeperre ha tenido en el cuerpo de polic\u00eda de Geel le otorga una visi\u00f3n acerca de las preguntas que surgen con frecuencia a partir de la experiencia del pueblo: \u00bfes seguro este enfoque?, y \u00bfel modelo de Geel solo puede existir en Geel?",
      "Es com\u00fan que las autoridades de Geel se encuentren con hu\u00e9spedes que se comportan de manera extra\u00f1a en p\u00fablico o que incluso no respetan la ley, coment\u00f3 Vandeperre. Pero gracias a la cultura de los hogares de acogida de este pueblo, saben c\u00f3mo calmar estas situaciones y llamar de inmediato al hospital psiqui\u00e1trico.",
      "Este enfoque se diferencia del de Estados Unidos y otros lugares, donde es posible que lo primero que se haga sea llamar a las fuerzas del orden cuando alguien est\u00e1 teniendo una crisis de salud mental. En muchas situaciones en las que participan polic\u00edas con un entrenamiento inadecuado, los resultados pueden ser ",
      ".",
      "Ellen Baxter, por ejemplo, cree que se pueden replicar los elementos fundamentales del modelo de Geel y ha pasado los \u00faltimos 35 a\u00f1os de su vida tratando de recrearlos en Nueva York.",
      "En 1975, Baxter, fundadora y directora de Broadway Housing Communities, una organizaci\u00f3n neoyorquina de beneficencia en el tema de la vivienda, estaba reci\u00e9n egresada de la licenciatura en psicolog\u00eda cuando, impaciente por saber m\u00e1s sobre el programa de familias de acogida, se fue un a\u00f1o a vivir a Geel. Regres\u00f3 a Nueva York y comenz\u00f3 a recabar fondos para construir edificios donde las personas con trastornos psiqui\u00e1tricos pudieran vivir dentro de una comunidad.",
      "El desarrollo m\u00e1s reciente, en el vecindario Sugar Hill de Harlem, es el que ella cree que se asemeja m\u00e1s a un \u201cGeel vertical\u201d. Este alberga familias y adultos solteros, algunos de los cuales viven con enfermedades mentales y muchos otros que no las padecen. Este complejo cuenta con un centro de cuidado diurno y un museo que atrae a quienes no viven en \u00e9l. Ah\u00ed todos se conocen.",
      "\u201cSe requieren dos elementos: un buen dise\u00f1o y tiempo\u201d, puntualiz\u00f3 Baxter en una entrevista.",
      "\u201cLa vida tiene que ver m\u00e1s con el pragmatismo de la cotidianeidad: hay contratiempos, hay gente que fallece y ni\u00f1os que nacen\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cLa proximidad de la experiencia dentro de una comunidad hace que los valores afloren, que no abandonemos a los ancianos ni a los enfermos mentales ni a los discapacitados\u201d.",
      "Bogaerts, el psic\u00f3logo, recuerda que la polic\u00eda fue llamada solo dos veces para resolver problemas importantes relacionados con los internos en Geel durante las dos d\u00e9cadas.",
      "Pero los incidentes ocurren.",
      "\u201cAlgunos d\u00edas son un poco m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles que otros\u201d, dijo Peetermans.",
      "Liliane Peeters, de 63 a\u00f1os, y su esposo, Jozef Vleugels, de 65, hab\u00edan estado albergando a un hu\u00e9sped durante 11 a\u00f1os cuando decidieron acoger a una segunda persona.",
      "Como una madre cuyos hijos ya no viv\u00edan en casa y que se hab\u00eda jubilado recientemente, Peeters sinti\u00f3 que su hogar ten\u00eda espacio para uno m\u00e1s. Despu\u00e9s de algunos ajustes menores, como averiguar que el nuevo hu\u00e9sped ten\u00eda problemas para hacer s\u00e1ndwiches, las cosas parecieron calmarse.",
      "\u201cQuer\u00eda asumir ese cuidado, tengo eso en alg\u00fan lugar dentro de m\u00ed\u201d, dijo. \u201cDe hecho, quer\u00eda a alguien para quien pudiera hacer los s\u00e1ndwiches\u201d.",
      "Un problema era que el ba\u00f1o estaba en un piso diferente al dormitorio del hu\u00e9sped, al pie de unas escaleras empinadas, y por la noche, Peeters le pidi\u00f3 que no lo usara para evitar ca\u00eddas.",
      "Una ma\u00f1ana, se despert\u00f3 y encontr\u00f3 al hu\u00e9sped en crisis despu\u00e9s de haber defecado en el piso del dormitorio. Peeters consigui\u00f3 guantes y un cepillo. Un asistente social la ayud\u00f3. El hu\u00e9sped regres\u00f3 al hospital.",
      "\u201cHay l\u00edmites en la atenci\u00f3n que las personas pueden dar y dar\u00e1n\u201d, dijo Bogaerts, el psic\u00f3logo. \u201cSi pasan cosas as\u00ed, si alguien ya lleva 10, 15 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s viviendo en una familia de acogida, entonces lograr\u00e1 encontrar una soluci\u00f3n\u201d. Agreg\u00f3: \u201cPero si sucede al principio, es demasiado\u201d.",
      "Otros episodios son menos conflictivos, pero profundamente desgarradores.",
      "Cuando Peetermans, quien hoy acoge a Iosif, Etty y Hayen, era ni\u00f1a, a menudo ve\u00eda a un hombre llamado Robert, un hu\u00e9sped que viv\u00eda con una familia en su calle, cortando rosas.",
      "A\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, cuando la familia adoptiva de Robert envejeci\u00f3, Peetermans decidi\u00f3 acogerlo. Robert se convirti\u00f3 en un hermano mayor para su hijo.",
      "Llevaba viviendo con ellos siete a\u00f1os cuando, durante la pandemia, su estado empeor\u00f3. En septiembre pasado se mud\u00f3 al hospital psiqui\u00e1trico, donde ahora lo visita regularmente.",

      "\u201cThis is the time when over 5,000 Russian military vehicles entered the zone, drove along the ground roads, and then soldiers started digging the trenches,\u201d Mr. Kirejev said. \u201cThey churned up the radioactive dust that was in the upper layer of the ground.\u201d",

      "GAZA CITY \u2014 On the morning of Eid al-Fitr, Arafat Helles will start the day with a special prayer at the mosque to mark the end of Ramadan, and eat a breakfast of salty cheeses to line his stomach for what is to come. Then, he will set out with his three brothers and father across the Gaza Strip.",
      "They will begin with their mother but eventually visit some 15 sisters, aunts and nieces, doling out dinars and shekels as part of a Palestinian custom of men marking the Muslim holiday by giving an eidiya, a gift of money, to female relatives.",
      "The visits will follow an almost choreographed routine. At each home, the men will be plied with coffee and sweets. After little more than 15 minutes, the social calls will end \u2014 a rarity in a society where such visits may last for hours, and often end in an invitation to stay for dinner.",
      "\u201cThis is the eidiya visit,\u201d said Mr. Helles, 48, a professor of social services at Al-Quds Open University, in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our important traditions.\u201d",
      "Giving an eidiya has long been a practice among Muslims \u2014 though it has no religious basis \u2014 and is believed by some to date back 1,000 years to the Fatimid dynasty and the practice of emirs giving gold coins or gifts during festivities.",
      "But in most Muslim cultures, adults give an eidiya to children, sometimes in small, token amounts. Palestinians give the money to both children and adult female relatives, making the tradition far more expensive, with the kind of financial burden and expectations that Christmas gift giving has in the West. The amounts can range from 20 shekels, about $6, to 365 shekels, about $100.",
      "These days, coming up with the money for the eidiya is especially onerous.",
      "The 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt has undermined the living conditions of more than two million Palestinians, and led to a nearly 50 percent unemployment rate that is among the highest in the world.",
      "To give the eidiya, some men will go into debt. Others will wait until their wives get their eidiya from relatives before turning around and using that money to give the gift to their other female relatives.",
      "\u201cHowever bad one\u2019s financial situation is, we have to go and give,\u201d said Mr. Helles\u2019s father, Hamid al-Abid Helles, 74. \u201cThis is a tradition we won\u2019t abandon.\u201d",
      "The practice comes at the end of a month of already added expenses for Ramadan, with the elaborate dinners after daily fasts, and decoration of homes and purchase of new clothes to be worn on Eid. In the weeks leading up to the holiday \u2014 which this year begins on Friday \u2014 shopping districts in Gaza were packed, with seasonal religious music just audible over the din of shoppers and honking horns.",
      "At each relative\u2019s house, Mr. Helles, his brothers and father will be served strong Turkish coffee, Eid date ",
      " and chocolates \u2014 part of the Eid diyafah, or hospitality. They will eat just enough to be polite but remain conscious that at the next stop they will be offered the same spread and encouraged to indulge.",
      "\u201cBy the end we have a stomachache,\u201d said Mr. Helles, a father of six. \u201cWe put all the chocolate in our pockets and tell them we\u2019ll eat it later.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe comes back home and his pocket is bulging with chocolates,\u201d said his wife, Basima Helles, 44.",
      "During each visit, the men will keep an eye on their watches. After 15 minutes, they\u2019ll begin making moves to leave, and call to the women of the house to accept the eidiya. The women, in turn, will protest out of politeness. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no need,\u201d they\u2019ll say. Some will put their hands behind their backs to avoid being handed the money.",
      "To lessen the embarrassment of bills being pressed into palms, shops across Gaza are now offering eidiya cards and small boxes to put the money in, to make the custom feel more like gift giving and less transactional. Some cards mention every female relation that could be on the receiving end of an eidiya: my granddaughter, my wife, my mother-in-law.",
      "Every year Ms. Helles tells her own brother not to give her an eidiya, because she knows that his financial situation is precarious, and that she is one of six sisters.",
      "\u201cWe say, \u2018we forgive you, we excuse you,\u2019 but he\u2019s not willing to come empty-handed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe considers this a social obligation.\u201d",
      "The next day, when women go to visit their families for Eid, she will return the money by giving it as an eidiya to his children.",
      "As the economic situation in Gaza has worsened in recent years, men unable to afford the gift giving have stopped visiting relatives altogether during Eid to avoid embarrassment.",
      "But religious leaders urge men not to abandon a religious obligation \u2014 visiting family \u2014 for the sake of a cultural one \u2014 the eidiya.",
      "That message hasn\u2019t always been heeded.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have an eidiya, it\u2019s better not to go,\u201d said Abdulmutee Matar, 31. \u201cBecause they are accustomed to when you greet them and shake hands, you have money in your hand. If your hand is empty .\u2026\u201d he trailed off, waving his empty hand in the air for emphasis.",
      "He used to give 50 shekels each to his wife, mother, four sisters and eight aunts when he ran his family\u2019s third-generation clothing store. But three years ago, he had to close the shop.",
      "Since then, he has only had occasional work but is still unwilling to give up the tradition. His mother, a teacher, gives him money so he can at least go see his sisters to give the eidiya. He no longer visits his aunts on Eid.",
      "For women, the eidiya can be an extra financial boost.",
      "Last year, Hanadi Tawaahena\u2019s father gave an eidiya to her three sisters and mother but not to her. He told her that was because she had a home baking business and was making her own money.",
      "\u201cThe eidiya is important, even if I work,\u201d said Ms. Tawaahena, 34, last week as she made Eid cookies in a house smelling of ghee and semolina flour. The sweets\u00a0will be part of the diyafah in homes across Gaza. She said it was not just a matter of money, but a matter of principle and being part of a longstanding tradition.",
      "She added with a laugh, \u201cI told him, \u2018Don\u2019t do that again.\u2019\u201d",
      "For other women, it is about the money, and they plan well in advance what to do with their haul, including buying a needed household item or clothes for their children.",
      "Ms. Tawaahena\u2019s sister, Shoroq, 28, was rolling out ground dates to stuff the cookies. She had already made plans with her friends to take their eidiya money and spend it at Gaza City\u2019s boardwalk and restaurants.",
      "\u201cWomen on Eid become rich,\u201d Hanadi Tawaahena said, with another laugh.",
      "Sitting on the other end of the table, rolling out dough, the sisters\u2019 mother, 50-year-old Ashjan, agreed.",
      "\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cthey make the men poor.\u201d"

      "BORNE SULINOWO, Poland \u2014 Set in a thick forest, ringed by limpid lakes and free of violent crime, the town of Borne Sulinowo in northwestern Poland has undeniable bucolic charm \u2014 except for the ghosts on every eerily quiet street of the Nazi and then Soviet soldiers who built it.",
      "Governed for the past three decades by Poland, the town was controlled by and part of Germany before World War II; seized by the Red Army in 1945; and occupied by Moscow\u2019s forces until 1992. For a time, it embraced its dark side, eager to attract visitors and money to a forlorn and formerly forbidden zone so secret it did not appear on maps.",
      "Military re-enactors, including enthusiasts from Germany and Russia, visited each year to stage a parade, dressed in Soviet and Nazi uniforms, which are banned from public display in Germany.",
      "A Polish businessman opened the Russia Hotel, decorating it with photographs of himself and a friend dressed in Russian military uniforms and with communist-era banners embroidered with images of Lenin. His other ventures in the town included a cafe named after Rasputin and boozy, Russia-themed corporate events.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion of Ukraine stopped all that. Kitsch became offensively creepy.",
      "\u201cEverything changed very quickly,\u201d said Monika Konieczna-Pilszek, the manager of the Russia Hotel and daughter of its founder. Online reviews, she said, suddenly went from \u201ccommenting on our food to talking about burning us down.\u201d",
      "She told her father they had to change the name. \u201cInstead of attracting people it was repelling them,\u201d she said. The inn is now called the Borne Sulinowo Guesthouse. A big Soviet banner hung in the hallway next to its restaurant has been turned round so Lenin is no longer visible.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to be reminded of Russia these days,\u201d Ms. Koniecnza-Pilszek said.",
      "Dariusz Tederko, a local official responsible for promoting the town, lamented that the war in Ukraine \u201chas turned everything upside down.\u201d The military re-enactors, he said, are no longer welcome. The Russians couldn\u2019t come anyway because of a government ban.",
      "Trying to draw more Poles and Western Europeans, he now promotes the town\u2019s less triggering charms. \u201cWe have lots of beautiful heather,\u201d he said, waving a brochure with pictures of hiking trails and wildflowers.",
      "But he misses the prewar days when Russia was \u201cnot so sensitive,\u201d and Borne Sulinowo did not have to feel ashamed about the one thing that set it apart from countless other places in Poland offering pleasant scenery and pretty flowers.",
      "He said he was still in touch with retired Russian soldiers, including one now working in the Kremlin, who served here during the Cold War and who used to return regularly for trips down memory lane.",
      "Unlike many Poles, residents of Borne Sulinowo often harbor little personal animosity toward Russians. They are appalled by the bloodshed in Ukraine but blame Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.",
      "During the Soviet era, the town \u2014 home to more than 10,000 soldiers of the Northern Group of Forces \u2014 was a world unto itself, scrubbed from maps and off limits to Poles without special entry passes, though many still sneaked in to buy food and vodka.",
      "Renata Szmurlo, a nurse who grew up in a Polish town near the Soviet zone and moved to Borne Sulinowo with her family after the Russians left, recalled a carefree youth of cycling past military checkpoints with her friends to visit the town\u2019s shops. They accepted Polish currency but, stocked with supplies from Moscow for Soviet officers, had more goods than Polish ones.",
      "\u201cThe Russians were great guys,\u201d she recalled.",
      "When the town was part of Germany, Hitler visited, arriving by train in 1938 to inspect what was then a secret military training ground, set up in the forest so that Nazi commanders could furtively practice the blitzkrieg tactics that, just a year later, would plunge Poland and then the rest of Europe into World War II.",
      "\u201cIf you just look at the trees and buildings, everything here looks OK, but if you know the history of this place it makes your skin crawl,\u201d said Dariusz Czerniawski, a former teacher who moved to Borne Sulinowo shortly after the last Russians pulled out. They left a ghost town of empty, dilapidated barracks, suddenly silent shooting ranges and fields rutted with tank tracks.",
      "After a year under the control of the Polish army, Borne Sulinowo reappeared on maps in 1993 as just another Polish town, inhabited by a few early pioneers like Mr. Czerniawski. \u201cIt was so quiet, I wanted to scream,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe silence and emptiness were terrifying.\u201d",
      "Over time, more Poles arrived, attracted by cheap housing and the chance for a fresh start. The town now has nearly 5,000 year-round residents and many more people during the summer. It still feels empty and isolated.",
      "The main road \u2014 Adolf Hitler Strasse during the Nazi period and Stalin Avenue after 1945 \u2014 is now Independence Street.",
      "Lined with gimcrack Soviet apartment blocks intermingled with sturdy villas left by the Germans, it has a few shops, a defunct pizza place and the Sasha Cafe, run by a Russian-speaking man from eastern Ukraine, who first came here as a young photographer working for the Soviet military command.",
      "A target of suspicious whispering by locals and scrutiny by Polish authorities, he recently put his property up for sale.",
      "Mr. Czerniawski, the early pioneer, today runs the town\u2019s museum and has spent a lot of time thinking about how to deal with the past.",
      "\u201cIt would perhaps be easier to demolish the whole town,\u201d he said, \u201cBut what would that give us \u2014 just a big empty space with no memory of anything?\u201d",
      "Borne Sulinowo, he believes, needs to survive as a \u201cunique place built by the two most brutal totalitarian systems of the last century\u201d \u2014 and as a reminder of where such systems lead. \u201cUsually to war,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe have to remember our bad past so that we can learn something for the future,\u201d he said.",
      "He has resisted suggestions to remove from the museum a mannequin dressed in a Russian military uniform and has rejected demands that the Soviet-designed tank opposite the entrance be taken away. Some residents threatened to destroy it.",
      "But the tank, Mr. Czerniawski noted, was put there",
      "by Polish authorities, who took it from a Warsaw military museum. \u201cIt is Soviet design but was made in Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is part of our history \u2014 perhaps not the glorious history we would like \u2014 but it is ours,\u201d he said.",
      "The most sinister reminders of Moscow\u2019s former hegemony \u2014 concrete bunkers housing nuclear warheads \u2014 have mostly been swallowed up by the forest near Brzeznica-Kolonia, a village 19 miles south of town.",
      "\u201cEntry Categorically Forbidden. Danger of death or disability,\u201d read signs put up in front of the crumbling, weed-clogged bunkers.",
      "Until the warheads were taken back to Russia in 1990 as the Soviet Union unraveled, they were part of the Vistula Program, a top-secret deployment of nuclear weapons in Poland that began in the 1960s. Throughout the Cold War, Moscow insisted it had no nuclear weapons in Poland while accusing the United States of threatening peace by putting its own warheads in Europe.",
      "For Jan Chmielowski, a Pole who first visited Borne Sulinowo in 1994 and \u201cimmediately fell in love with this strange place,\u201d the Soviet past was for years \u201cjust a big sad joke\u201d because everything left by the Russians seemed to be falling apart.",
      "He bought an old German villa, turned it into a guesthouse and, inspired by the Russia Hotel next door, began organizing corporate team-building events featuring vodka, surly Soviet-style service and mock arrests by fake Russian officers with guns. He has dropped that and now organizes French-themed events with champagne and without weapons.",
      "\u201cEverything Russian stopped being funny after the war in Ukraine,\u201d he lamented."

      "\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it move?\u201d one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, \u201cService suspended.\u201d It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.",
      "\u201cThe water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,\u201d answered Sara Asperti, 45. \u201cAlso, they\u2019re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.\u201d",
      "Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks\u00a0of the Adda\u00a0belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and ",

      "In the past century, reproductions of the original\u00a0ferries have linked Italy\u2019s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.",
      "But a year after Italy\u2019s worst drought in seven decades \u2014 when much of Europe gasped for precipitation \u2014 a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country\u2019s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not Moses,\u201d she responded.",
      "This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls \u201cLeonardesque\u201d ferries has become a stationary landmark.",
      "\u201cIf it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,\u201d said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago\u2019s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was \u201cthe family jewel of the town \u2014 we cannot be left without it.\u201d",
      "The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was \u201cevidence of a global problem.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.\u201d",
      "But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry\u2019s immobility since May.",
      "\u201cBureaucracy,\u201d said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.",
      "Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.",
      "The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn\u2019t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals \u2014 \u201cYou should see the hair on this guy,\u201d he said, cupping the phone \u2014 remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.",
      "\u201cI mean Leonardo wasn\u2019t a moron,\u201d he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s to scale; it\u2019s worth 500 euros,\u201d or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.",
      "\u201cThe force of the ferry is these,\u201d Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.",
      "What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring \u201cThe Human Face of the Ferry\u201d and its pilots over the past century. \u201cHarvard, Harvard, Harvard,\u201d Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. \u201cThey all went to Harvard.\u201d",
      "Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.",
      "\u201cI thought with my license I could do it,\u201d Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo\u2019s sketch and an excerpt from Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d about Charon, \u201cferryman of the damned.\u201d",
      "A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association \u2014 which has the ferry as its logo \u2014 Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really long process,\u201d said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.",
      "In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.",
      "Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant \u201cwe will suffer this summer.\u201d",
      "Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and \u201ckeep the tap closed\u201d to ensure the lake\u2019s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area\u2019s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.",
      "Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where \u201cI found a lot of dead fish.\u201d",
      "Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo\u2019s \u201c",
      ".\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of that is usually covered with water,\u201d Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. \u201cIn 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen the river like this.\u201d",
      "Near Imbersago\u2019s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.",
      "\u201cThere used to be people in the piazza,\u201d he said, as the iron hissed. \u201cThose times are finished.\u201d",
      "Evening fell and the day\u2019s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s months that it doesn\u2019t rain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.\u201d",
      "Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s two drops,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d"

      "The kings and queens of London\u2019s lesser-known royal family gathered outside a church in Covent Garden on a recent Sunday afternoon dressed in their sparkly finery.",
      "But their jewels of choice were not diamonds or rubies. They were\u00a0buttons made of mother-of-pearl that covered their jet-black suits and hats in intricate patterns, sewn by hand into elaborate designs that glitter in the sunlight.",
      "These are the Pearly Kings and Queens of London \u2014 keepers of a tradition that began in the Victorian era, was passed down through generations of families and became a symbol of the city\u2019s working-class, Cockney culture. They see themselves as custodians of a waning way of life, which they carry on by singing Cockney songs, sharing Cockney stories and, crucially, collecting money for good causes.",
      "Modern pearlies, grouped by geographic area of London, have organized themselves into a few charitable groups and, like the better-known royal family, have at times feuded. But the pearlies argue over which group ",
      ".",
      "Once a month, some pearlies\u00a0rattle blue plastic buckets to collect charity donations at Covent Garden, a former market turned tourist draw, in London\u2019s West End.",
      "\u201cMost Londoners know about the Pearly Kings and Queens,\u201d said John Walters, 75, who holds the title of Pearly King of Finsbury, an area of north London. \u201cI had an elderly lady come up here and she grabbed hold of me and she started crying and said, \u2018I\u2019m so pleased to see you\u2019re still around.\u2019 She said, \u2018You are London.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tourists, though, are often pleasantly\u00a0surprised\u00a0to encounter them.",
      "On a bright March morning, Mr. Walters and Clive Bennett, 68, the Pearly King of Woolwich, in the city\u2019s southeast, were approached by a group of young women \u2014 one wearing a \u201cbride to be\u201d sash \u2014 who asked for a photograph. The men, in Cockney accents, instantly broke into a rendition of \u201cGet Me to the Church on Time\u201d from \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d as the women erupted in laughter and threw a few pounds into their buckets. The men tipped their flat caps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real honor to be able to do something like this actually, and it\u2019s fun,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cYou meet all sorts of people.\u201d",
      "He was invited to take part in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics and took part in events on the sidelines of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s jubilee and funeral.",
      "The over-the-top outfits that the pearlies are known for \u2014 with the back of their clothing bearing their august titles in bold lettering \u2014 are as peculiar as they are eye-catching, with feathers, shine and patterns assaulting the eyes. The idea for the finery grew from the tradition in\u00a0Cockney culture of\u00a0thumbing noses at London society\u2019s disdainful view of the lower classes.",
      "For Mr. Bennett, and many others, being a pearly is a family affair. His wife, Kim, 66, is a Pearly Queen and his daughter and grandchildren take part in fund-raising\u00a0events, as well, under the title of Pearly Princesses and Princes.",
      "Like most royal families, pearlies typically inherit their titles or marry into the tradition. But others, like the Bennetts, have been invited in because of their commitment to community work and charity.",
      "\u201cToday, there is a need for us now more than ever, \u201d Ms. Bennett said, as she pointed to the\u00a0inflationary pressures on many local\u00a0communities.",
      "Henry Croft \u2014 an orphan and a London street sweeper \u2014 is considered the first Pearly King. In the late 1870s, he\u00a0became known for covering his clothing with mother-of-pearl buttons to draw attention as he collected money for hospitals and orphanages.",
      "Mr. Croft was said to have taken his fashion inspiration from costermongers, who were roving traders selling fruit, vegetables, fish and produce on the streets of east London, a working-class area that developed its own distinct accent and vocabulary riddled with rhyming slang, known as Cockney.",
      "The costermongers sewed buttons onto their clothes to distinguish themselves and to mimic the rich, ",
      ". These coster communities would elect a leader in their local area to keep the peace and collect money to support fellow traders down on their luck.",
      "\u201cIf someone\u2019s fruit went off, or the donkey was ill, or something like that,\u201d said Mr. Bennett, describing how the costermongers would have a singalong and pass around a bucket for donations. \u201cI think that\u2019s where Henry Croft got his whole ethos from.\u201d",
      "But Mr. Croft took his pearly suits and generosity to a new level, putting on his dazzling button suit as he gathered money for the poor and the sick.",
      "Others soon joined him. At the time of Mr. Croft\u2019s funeral in 1930, dozens of pearlies from across London joined the cortege to honor him, ",
      ".",
      "While London lore holds that to be a true Cockney, a person must be born within earshot of Bow Bells, which ring from ",
      " in east London, pearly titles are now held by people from communities across all of London\u2019s boroughs.",
      "While some pearly traditions have shifted, the rules on the buttons themselves have stayed consistent: They must be true mother-of-pearl, not imitation. Generally, they are passed down through families.",
      "\u201cA lot of the buttons are over 100 years old on there,\u201d said David Hemsley, 60, describing the jacket he inherited from his father.",
      "In Covent Garden, after a few hours of cheekily delivering rhyming Cockney slang to curious crowds and singing old tunes with gusto while collecting donations, the pearlies make their way into the nearby St. Paul\u2019s Church to hold their monthly meeting.",
      "\u201cCome on then, let\u2019s go!\u201d\u00a0Doreen Golding, 83, the Pearly Queen of Bow Bells and the Old Kent Road, shouted to the group as she led the way to the church vestry.",
      "As the chairwoman of London\u2019s Pearly Kings and Queens Society, Ms. Golding was honored by the late queen for her charity efforts. She said the pearlies would continue to wear their buttons and keep up their charitable giving for as long as there was a need.",
      "\u201cI get upset when someone says, \u2018Oh, are you still around? We didn\u2019t think there was any more of you left,\u2019\u201d Ms. Golding said with a laugh. \u201cAnd I think, \u2018Now hang on, open your bloody eyes and look, we are here!\u2019\u201d"

      "GLOUCESTER, England \u2014 The coronation of King Charles III and Camilla, the queen consort, on Saturday will involve many of the same ancient traditions that have been followed for nearly a thousand years. But some things will be new: The royal horse-drawn carriage will have air-conditioning. There will be an official coronation emoji issued by Buckingham Palace.",
      "And, in a break with eight centuries of culinary tradition, a pie for the newly crowned monarch has been baked not with lampreys \u2014 slimy, jawless, eel-like fish with a single nostril \u2014 but with pork.",
      "At a ceremony on Thursday in the city of Gloucester, about 100 miles northwest of London, Mayor Howard Hyman presented the pie to a representative for the king. Instead of actual lampreys, whose numbers\u00a0in Britain\u00a0have dwindled, the pie was decorated with two pastry lampreys. A third pastry lamprey had fallen off.",
      "Charles\u2019s representative, Lord-Lieutenant Edward Gillespie, accepted the pie on behalf of the king and donated it to a local charity focusing on hunger. He said that it was right that the tradition had been updated. \u201cIt would be inappropriate in these times to present lampreys to anybody,\u201d Lord-Lieutenant Gillespie said after the ceremony. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said of the king.",
      "While some in Gloucester lamented the change in tradition, many said it made sense to substitute pork for lamprey to reflect changing tastes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not particularly fussed at what\u2019s in the pie,\u201d Alan Myatt, the town crier, said at the ceremony, which about 100 people attended at the Folk of Gloucester museum, a building constructed in the 1500s. \u201cThe most important thing is we\u2019re commemorating and celebrating the coronation by presenting a pie.\u201d He applauded Gloucester for coming together to carry on the tradition. \u201cGod save the king!\u201d the crowd chanted.",
      "The tradition of supplying the monarch with lampreys dates to at least the late 12th century, when lampreys, then plentiful in the\u00a0local\u00a0River Severn, were served at royal banquets and feasts, said Andrew Armstrong, an archaeologist for the Gloucester City Council. Even earlier, in 1135, King Henry I died after eating too many lampreys, according to \u201cThe History of the English People 1000-1154,\u201d by Henry of Huntingdon, the 12th-century Anglo-Norman historian.",
      "In 1200, King John fined the men of Gloucester 40 marks \u2014 a significant sum at the time \u2014 for failing to deliver a lamprey pie. John\u2019s son, King Henry III, was also a big fan, and his household accounts show entries of payments for lamprey orders for him and for his wife, Eleanor, Queen of England, according to the short book \u201cRoyal Lamprey Pie of Gloucester,\u201d published in 1953.",
      "In the past, lampreys were marinated in red wine or salt and then roasted with spices, ",
      ", a charity that manages historic buildings in England. By the 18th century, the lamprey pie recipe included lemons, Mr. Armstrong said.",
      "Queen Elizabeth II received several lamprey pies over her 70-year reign, though it was unclear whether she ever sampled any of them.",
      "Robin Start, 96, who attended the ceremony in Gloucester on Thursday, was among a group of war veterans who delivered a 42-pound lamprey pie to Windsor Castle for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in 1953. Lampreys are \u201chorrible, horrible things,\u201d Mr. Start said, describing how they latch on to other fish and suck their blood. \u201cWould you want to eat a fish like that?\u201d",
      "Charles most likely would not. A longtime environmentalist, he has spoken out against overfishing and said in a BBC interview\u00a0in 2021\u00a0that he ",
      ". The official dish for the coronation, ",
      ", is a vegetarian quiche made of spinach, tarragon, cheese and fava beans. ",
      " at street and garden parties that will take place across Britain over the long coronation weekend, which begins on Saturday.",
      "While lampreys have fallen out of fashion in Britain, they are still eaten in parts of Europe. The Portuguese town of ",
      " holds an annual lamprey festival, in which gourmands descend on the city to sample lampreys, which are prepared by boiling them in their own blood.",
      "Other culinary traditions long popular with European nobility persist today. ",
      ", a tiny songbird whose dwindling numbers caused the government to forbid its sale. Diners consume the bird ",
      " while covering their heads with white napkins\u00a0to hide their sin from God (and to savor the aroma). Former President ",
      " before he died in 1996 included the rare and illegal ortolan.",
      "Eating lamprey in Britain is not illegal, but catching one requires permission from the British government. The city of Gloucester used lampreys in pies for Elizabeth in 2012 and 2015, though the lampreys were imported from Canada, where they were considered pests and a threat to local trout populations.",
      "While Gloucester officials said",
      "it was no longer appropriate to ship lampreys from Canada, given Charles\u2019s focus on sustainability, the tradition could potentially be brought back\u00a0if conservation efforts in England are successful.",
      "\u201cIf we can restore them, they\u2019ll no longer be an endangered species,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said, \u201cand we\u2019ll be happier about putting them in pies.\u201d"

      "Palestinian leaders and armed groups vowed retaliation, saying Israel was responsible for the death of Mr. Adnan, the first Palestinian prisoner to die on a hunger strike since 1992.",
      "A barrage of more than 20 rockets was launched into southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on Tuesday afternoon, seriously injuring a Chinese construction worker in the town of Sderot, according to Israeli media.",
      "A joint statement from armed Palestinian groups in Gaza claimed responsibility for the rockets \u201cas a first response to this heinous crime that will trigger responses from our people in all arenas and places of engagement.\u201d",
      "Islamic Jihad identified him as a longtime leader, and called for retaliation against Israel. Hamas, another armed group, also vowed retaliation.",
      "Israel fired tank shells at border observation points inside Gaza. There were no injuries.",
      "Late Tuesday night, Israel launched a series of airstrikes on at least four areas across the Gaza Strip that Palestinian news media reported belonged to armed groups. Earlier in the day, the groups had evacuated their offices and bases in anticipation of the counterstrikes, and there were no preliminary reports of injuries.",
      "The Palestinian Foreign Ministry also said it held Israel responsible for Mr. Adnan\u2019s death, called for an international investigation and said it planned to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court. The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, accused Israel of \u201ca deliberate assassination,\u201d by failing to release Mr. Adnan and give him proper treatment.",
      "Mr. Adnan, 44, was arrested by Israel on Feb. 5\u00a0on suspicion of membership in a terrorist organization, support for terrorism and incitement as a member of the Palestinian armed group Islamic Jihad. He had been on a hunger strike since his arrest.",
      "Mr. Adnan was being held at the Israel Prison Service medical center\u00a0when he was found unconscious in his cell on Tuesday, prison authorities said. He was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation and then transferred to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Physicians for Human Rights Israel, a nongovernmental group of doctors that examined Mr. Adnan, had warned that his death was \u201cimminent\u201d and called for him to be transferred to a hospital. But an appeals court had ruled that there was no evidence that Mr. Adnan was in an urgent medical state.",
      "Hana Herbst, a spokeswoman for the Israel Prison Service, said Mr. Adnan had been taken to a hospital on numerous occasions, but had each time refused medical treatment and was transferred back to the Israeli prison medical center.",
      "\u201cHe decided to go on hunger strike and he refused any medical examination and any medical treatment,\u201d Ms. Herbst said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done anything different other than forcing him to take medical treatment, which we can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "The doctors group, though, said in the statement that Mr. Adnan wanted to be hospitalized and gave three conditions for undergoing medical examinations, which included allowing his family to visit, being accompanied by a doctor from the rights group and that his medical information would not be shared with the Israeli prison service.",
      "At Mr. Adnan\u2019s last court hearing on Thursday, which he attended remotely from his bed, the military judge denied a third appeal for his pretrial release, which cited his deteriorating medical condition, according to court documents.",
      "In his rejection of the appeal, a military judge, Lt. Col. Menachem Lieberman, said Mr. Adnan \u201cfully understands his actions and where they will lead him. He is the master of his own body.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lieberman said he had not been presented with any medical opinion that Mr. Adnan\u2019s life was in immediate danger, according to the court documents.",
      "Dr. Lina Qasem-Hassan, a family medicine specialist and the chairwoman of the doctors group, visited Mr. Adnan on April 23 and said he struggled to move and maintain a basic conversation. His limbs had atrophied and he was dangerously emaciated, weighing less than 125 pounds, according to her assessment, the group said in its statement.",
      "The doctors group said in its statement that it had been urging his transfer to a hospital based on urgent medical grounds for weeks.",
      "\u201cAccording to medical ethics principles, Adnan\u2019s requests are reasonable,\u201d Anat Litvin, the director of the group\u2019s prisoners and detainees department, said in the statement on Monday. \u201cThere is no reason to deny them other than a desire to punish him and end his strike. This is a clear power struggle between the security authorities and the hunger striker.\u201d",

Mr. Haq, deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, said at a briefing: \u201cWe would certainly welcome any lasting meaningful truce.

      "Mr. Marcos, known by his boyhood nickname, Bongbong, has the electorate\u2019s backing. Surveys have shown that most Filipinos consider China to be a pressing threat and want the Marcos administration to work more closely with the United States to resist Beijing\u2019s territorial pressure and improve its security forces. Mr. Marcos\u2019s approval rating stands at 78 percent, according to a March survey conducted by Pulse Asia, a polling company.",
      "Analysts say that another factor driving Mr. Marcos\u2019s outreach is his personal desire to rehabilitate his family name, one that for decades was seen as a byword for excess and greed.",

      "Despite his new popularity, Mr. Marcos remains a polarizing figure.",
      "On Monday, a group of left-leaning political activists gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila to protest Mr. Marcos\u2019s meeting with Mr. Biden. \u201cWe fear that more of our sovereignty will be bartered off in exchange for secondhand equipment and promises of military aid,\u201d said Renato Reyes, the leader of the group, Bayan.",
      "Even as recently as last year, it was unclear what kind of reception Mr. Marcos would receive in the United States. He faces an outstanding contempt of court order in Hawaii for refusing to disclose where his family\u2019s wealth is hidden, resulting in damages that cannot be paid in a class-action lawsuit filed for human rights abuses under his father\u2019s rule.",
      "Soon after Mr. Marcos\u2019s election victory, Kurt Campbell, the White House coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, said that \u201chistorical considerations\u201d could pose \u201cchallenges\u201d to the Biden administration\u2019s engagement with Mr. Marcos.",
      "There are fears that Mr. Marcos could follow in the autocratic footsteps of his father, who was still supported by past American presidents before his fall. To his detractors, he is a historical revisionist whose sole aim is to whitewash his family\u2019s tarnished legacy; he is accused of ",

      "For these Filipinos, watching the meeting between Mr. Marcos and Mr. Biden was surreal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of historical vertigo for folks who pay attention to Philippine politics, but also Filipinos themselves,\u201d said Adrian De Leon, a Filipino writer and historian at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt was just less than 50 years ago that the father of the current president of this administration was being condemned publicly by a lot of prominent members of the U.S. government, Biden himself included. And here we have him courting the son.\u201d",
      "Mr. De Leon said he found it particularly disturbing \u201cthe swiftness with which, history is not just forgotten, but actively lobotomized.\u201d",
      "In 1986, Mr. Biden, then a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, criticized President Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cwaffling statements\u201d on the elder Marcos, who had imposed a 14-year period of martial law resulting in the arrests and torture of thousands.",
      "\u201cWe cannot afford to choose between our interests in the Philippines. We have important military installations there and we have a commitment to the survival of democracy,\u201d Mr. Biden said to the Senate, according to the Congressional Record. \u201cThe two are inseparable.\u201d",
      "Representative Susan Wild, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has proposed legislation to suspend military aid to the Philippines until it improves its human rights record. She said she has pressed Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeatedly to raise the issue of human rights with Filipino officials and has \u201cbeen assured more than one time that the Biden administration takes it very seriously.\u201d",
      "Mr. Marcos, 65, got an early taste of politics from his father. As a child, he met two of China\u2019s transformative leaders, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and Gen. Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator. Mr. Biden noted that the last time Mr. Marcos was in the White House was when he accompanied the elder Marcos in a meeting with former President Reagan.",
      "Until last year, it was never clear where Mr. Marcos personally stood on the United States, given his family\u2019s history. But by inclination and background, he has demonstrated that he is pro-Western in his leanings. He went to Oxford University in England. He enjoys watching Formula 1 and loves rock music, particularly Eric Clapton and the Beatles. He also loves cooking for his family and makes a mean gumbo, according to Matthew Marcos Manotoc, Mr. Marcos\u2019s nephew and the governor of Ilocos Norte, the stronghold of the Marcos family.",
      "Before last year\u2019s visit to New York in September, Mr. Marcos had not set foot in the United States for 15 years, saying he could not \u201ctake that risk\u201d of potential jail time.",
      "Robert Swift, the lawyer who launched the class action suit against the Marcoses, said that he is awaiting a verdict from a New York court on a possible redistribution of $40 million worth of funds belonging to the elder Marcos and that he was optimistic about getting another payout for the victims.",
      "Mr. Swift said that \u201cthe United States government can do better by human rights victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the story of the last 50 years is that the United States will support dictators so long as they are friendly dictators,\u201d he said, \u201cand that they will let them do what they want in their home countries without the U.S. interfering.\u201d",

      "Russia is ramping up pressure on civilians in occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials, whose forces have stepped up their assaults behind enemy lines ahead of a widely expected counteroffensive.",
      "The assault could prove a critical opportunity after 14 months of war, not just for Ukraine to regain territory but also for it to try and persuade its Western allies to send still more weapons and aid. Anticipating the campaign, and still recovering from their ",
      ", many Russian forces have shifted into defensive positions.",
      "Despite its staggering losses,",
      "Russia still controls a large swath of Ukrainian territory. But Ukrainian forces have repeatedly struck Russian positions far from the front, and on Tuesday the Russian authorities reported more shelling and \u2014 for the second day in a row \u2014 an explosion that derailed a freight train in the Russian border region.",
      "The Russian authorities in occupied territory, wary of strikes by Ukrainian partisans and special forces, have imposed strict new measures on civilians. Most recently, they have \u201creinforced\u201d counterintelligence units and are restricting travel between towns and villages, Ukraine\u2019s military high command said Tuesday.",
      "Last week, the Kremlin decreed that anyone in occupied territory who did not accept a Russian passport ",
      ", an edict that has sown confusion and fear among residents, according to the Ukrainian military and local officials. ",

      "The plainclothes officers often initiate conversation \u201cto find \u2018disloyal\u2019 citizens,\u201d ",

      "It is virtually impossible to independently verify much of what happens in Russian-occupied territory, because independent journalists, humanitarian groups and international observers are rarely granted access by the Russian authorities.",
      "But the Kremlin has made no secret of its efforts to absorb the regions into Russia.",

      "Ukrainian officials typically call on people who live in occupied territories to resist Russia any way they can, but they have offered mixed advice on how to respond to the recent pressure. While the Ukrainian human rights commissioner ",

      "Serhii Khlan, a deputy administrator of the Kherson Regional Council, ",

      " by the Russian authorities, and an atmosphere of intense fear and paranoia about who may be working with the Russians and who may have ties to the Ukrainian military or special forces.",
      "Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out attacks far behind the front line. Ukrainian officials usually refuse to ",
      ", but say they reserve the right to strike places used as staging grounds for attacks on Ukraine. Under this rationale, Ukrainian forces have periodically hit targets inside Russia.",
      "In the Bryansk region early Tuesday, a village less than five miles from the border with Ukraine came under shellfire, the third straight day of explosions in the area. The shelling started a fire, but there were no casualties, the regional governor, Aleksandr V. Bogomaz, said on Telegram. He blamed the Ukrainian military, though the claim could not be independently verified.",

      "BERLIN \u2014 Every day as he settles in at his desk, Erhard Grundl, a German lawmaker, looks outside his office window into the embassy he knows may be spying on him.",
      "\u201cI come into the office, and on a windy day, I see the Russian flag waving. It feels a bit like Psalm 23: \u2018You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,\u2019\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m not religious, but I always think of that.\u201d",
      "In the shadow of Berlin\u2019s glass-domed Reichstag, beyond the sandstone columns of Brandenburg Gate, German parliamentary buildings sit cheek by jowl with Russia\u2019s sprawling, Stalinist-style diplomatic mission. For years, a silent espionage struggle played out here along the city\u2019s iconic Unter den Linden avenue.",
      "Members of Parliament like Mr. Grundl were warned by intelligence offices to protect themselves \u2014 to turn computer screens away from the window, stop using wireless devices that were easier to tap, and close the window blinds for meetings.",
      "It seems an almost comical situation for officials in one of Europe\u2019s most powerful nations, where tensions over Russian espionage were something Germany\u2019s government long seemed willing to ignore. That has become increasingly difficult since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as a Cold War-era style chill settles across the continent and recasts relations with Russia.",
      "Late last month, Russia exposed what it described as a \u201cmass expulsion\u201d of its diplomats in Germany when it announced a tit-for-tat expulsion of more than 20 German diplomats from Moscow. It was a rare sign, security analysts say, of a subdued but growing counterintelligence effort that Berlin is now belatedly undertaking, after years of increasingly brazen Russian intelligence operations on German soil.",
      "At least twice, Russian groups suspected of Kremlin links have hacked German politicians and Parliament \u2014 the ",
      " just months before the 2021 elections that ended Angela Merkel\u2019s 16 years at the helm and brought in Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",
      "A few years earlier, a gunman accused of ",
      " shot dead a Georgian dissident in broad daylight at the leafy Kleiner Tiergarten park, less than a mile away from Berlin\u2019s government district.",
      "In 2021, police ",
      " a security guard at the nearby British Embassy who had been spying for Russia.",
      "And late last year, in perhaps the most disturbing case of all, a German intelligence officer was ",
      " passing surveillance of the war in Ukraine to Moscow.",
      "Germany\u2019s foreign ministry has been tight-lipped about the latest expulsions \u2014 even refusing to call them expulsions. But it acknowledged the\u00a0diplomats\u2019 departure was linked to \u201creducing the Russian intelligence presence in Germany.\u201d",
      "Expulsions were long a common German response to Russian operations \u2014 including the first parliamentary hack, in 2015, and the invasion of Ukraine, when 40 diplomats were sent back to Moscow. But security experts see the current move as part of a broader effort to bolster counterintelligence and chip away discreetly at what they long warned was an extremely high spy count at the embassy.",
      "Still, analysts like Stefan Meister, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, said years of neglecting counterintelligence would take a long time to repair. When he worked with German spy agencies in 2000, he recalled, they did not have a single Russian speaker on staff. In contrast, he said, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, had long made Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, a top target for espionage.",
      "\u201cWe are not where we should be, or should have been,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russians are learning also. They have no limits, they have a lot of resources they put into this hybrid war, the information war. And we are always a few steps behind.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinally, they expel these guys,\u201d he added. \u201cBut why did it take so long?\u201d",
      "At the heart of the debate over Germany\u2019s handling of Russian espionage is the Russian Embassy: a palatial complex of soaring stone towers engraved with Soviet hammers and sickles. It has long been a site of fascination, consternation and intrigue.",
      "Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even for years after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the embassy was famous for lavish parties that attracted top German car industry executives, politicians, soccer stars and actors.",
      "But it had a darker side: Two of its inhabitants have mysteriously fallen to their deaths from embassy windows. In 2021, a ",
      " outside on the pavement by the German police, who believed he was an undercover agent of the FSB, the Russian secret service branch that Western officials linked to the Tiergarten murder.",
      "It is an open secret that most diplomatic missions host spies among their ranks, and for years, a former senior aide to Ms. Merkel told The New York Times, she and her staffers who visited the embassy would trade guesses as to how many worked at the embassy there \u2014 sometimes suggesting up to 600.",
      "In a recent ",
      " for ARD, the country\u2019s state broadcaster, the estimate of embassy staff before the war was said to be more than 500. German officials generally assumed that at least a third of those were spies, the former Merkel aide said.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency told ARD it found potential espionage equipment on the embassy roof \u2014 perhaps to spy on lawmakers across the street, like Mr. Grundl, or Frank Schwabe, from Mr. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe are not well enough prepared,\u201d said Mr. Schwabe, who works in the building across from the embassy, and focuses on human rights. \u201cI would actually like to see a targeted security strategy in Germany that really enables members of Parliament, to help them really arm themselves against these kinds of wiretapping attempts.\u201d",
      "For now, he offers visitors like Russian dissidents or civil society actors the option to move to another room \u2014 or to position themselves so their lips cannot be read.",
      "Security experts say such tips are not nearly enough to help politicians who appear to be a top target \u2014 not just near the embassy, but anywhere, using vans with smaller devices that can tap into phones and hear conversations.",
      "Mr. Meister said lawmakers with sensitive portfolios could be moved farther from the Russian Embassy. \u201cThen again, what isn\u2019t sensitive now? A domestic policy or other issues, like migration, could be used by the Russian side \u2014 there is almost nothing that isn\u2019t sensitive at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Nico Lange, a former German Defense Ministry official, who is now a senior fellow at the Munich Security Conference, said issues like migration were a key topic used by Russia in identifying and recruiting frustrated, far-right sympathizing members of German security and defense forces \u2014 like the mole arrested last year, or the security guard stealing information from the British Embassy.",
      "Complicating Germany\u2019s efforts to effectively combat Russian intelligence is the country\u2019s federalized system: Each German state has a different intelligence service.",
      "Mr. Lange acknowledged cooperation and data sharing among the services was improving, but said the setup inevitably has gaps. He also urged legislators to reverse laws granting espionage targets, even abroad, the same constitutional rights as German citizens.",
      "\u201cIntelligence agencies are a tit-for-tat business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not able to gather information, then your partners will not trade with you.\u201d",
      "Mr. Lange\u2019s current worry is that\u00a0Russian spies are\u00a0seeking information on weapons or training for Ukrainian soldiers. Already, suspected Russian operatives have been found near military training sites in Germany.",
      "Last month, Poland said it uncovered a ",
      " that had hidden cameras on rail lines in the southeast of the country, a major transit route for arms shipments to Ukraine. ",
      "But some lawmakers in Germany wonder whether concerns over Russia\u2019s spies have strayed too far from a problem within their own walls: Members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, whose leaders were frequent guests at the Russian Embassy, hold seats in some of the most important parliamentary committees, from foreign affairs to defense.",
      "Mr. Grundl fretted over the fact that just last week, those far-right colleagues sat on a parliamentary committee while a secret topic was discussed.",
      "\u201cThey are sitting in there, and they have the best connections to Moscow,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cThat\u2019s the bigger headache to me: the enemy within.\u201d",

      "DONGDUCHEON, South Korea \u2014 When Cho Soon-ok was 17 in 1977, three men kidnapped and sold her to a pimp in Dongducheon, a town north of Seoul.",
      "She was about to begin high school, but instead of pursuing her dream of becoming a ballerina, she was forced to spend the next five years under the constant watch of her pimp, going to a nearby club for sex work. Her customers: American soldiers.",
      "The euphemism \u201ccomfort women\u201d typically describes Korean and other Asian women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese during World War II. But the sexual exploitation of another group of women continued in South Korea long after Japan\u2019s colonial rule ended in 1945 \u2014 and it was facilitated by their own government.",
      "There were \u201cspecial comfort women units\u201d for South Korean soldiers, and \u201ccomfort stations\u201d for American-led U.N. troops during the Korean War. In the postwar years, many of these women worked in gijichon, or \u201ccamp towns,\u201d built around American military bases.",
      "Last September, 100 such women won a landmark victory when the South Korean Supreme Court ordered compensation for the sexual trauma they endured. It found the government guilty of \u201cjustifying and encouraging\u201d prostitution in camp towns to help South Korea maintain its military alliance with the United States and earn American dollars.",
      "It also blamed the government for the \u201csystematic and violent\u201d way it detained the women and forced them to receive treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "In interviews with The New York Times, six former South Korean camp\u00a0town women described how their government used them for political and economic gain before abandoning them. Encouraged by the court rulings \u2014 which relied on recently unsealed official documents \u2014 the victims now aim to take their case to the United States.",
      "\u201cThe Americans need to know what some of their soldiers did to us,\u201d said Park Geun-ae, who was sold to a pimp in 1975, when she was 16, and said she endured severe beatings and other abuse from G.I.s. \u201cOur country held hands with the U.S. in an alliance and we knew that its soldiers were here to help us, but that didn\u2019t mean that they could do whatever they wanted to us, did it?\u201d",
      "South Korea\u2019s history of sexual exploitation is not always openly discussed. When a sociologist, Kim Gwi-ok, began reporting on wartime comfort women for the South Korean military in the early 2000s, citing documents from the South Korean Army, the government had the documents sealed.",
      "\u201cThey feared that Japan\u2019s right wing would use it to help whitewash its own comfort women history,\u201d said Ms. Kim, referring to historical feuds between Seoul and Tokyo over sexual slavery.",
      "In the aftermath of the Korean War, South Korea trailed the North in military and economic power. American troops stayed in the South under the U.N. flag to guard against the North, but South Korea struggled to keep U.S. boots on the ground.",
      "In 1961, Gyeonggi Province, the populous area surrounding Seoul, considered it \u201curgent to prepare mass facilities for comfort women to provide comfort for U.N. troops or boost their morale,\u201d according to documents submitted to the court as evidence. The local government gave permits to private clubs to recruit such women to \u201csave budget and earn foreign currency.\u201d It estimated the number of comfort women in its jurisdiction at 10,000 and growing, catering to 50,000 American troops.",
      "When President Richard M. Nixon announced plans in 1969 to reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, the government\u2019s effort took on more urgency. The following year, the government reported to Parliament that South Korea was earning $160 million annually through business resulting from the U.S. military presence, including the sex trade. (The country\u2019s total exports at the time were $835 million.)",
      "Some of the women gravitated to camp towns to find a living. Others, like Ms. Cho, were abducted, or lured with the promise of work. A sex act typically cost between $5 and $10 \u2014 money the pimps confiscated. Although the dollars didn\u2019t go directly to the government, they entered the economy, which was starved for hard currency.",
      "A South Korean newspaper at the time called such women an \u201cillegal, cancer-like, necessary evil.\u201d But \u201cthese comfort women are also frontline warriors in winning dollars,\u201d it said.",
      "Often, newcomers were drugged by their pimps to cope with the shame.",
      "Society mostly dismissed such women as yanggalbo, or \u201cwhores for the West,\u201d part of the price of maintaining the U.S. military presence in the country after the war.",
      "\u201cThe officials who called us patriots sneered behind our back, calling us \u2018dollar-earning machines,\u2019\u201d Ms. Park said.",
      " was and remains illegal in South Korea, but enforcement has been selective and varied in harshness over time. Camp towns were created in part to confine the women so they could be more easily monitored, and to prevent prostitution and sex crimes involving American G.I.s from spreading to the rest of society. Black markets thrived there as South Koreans clamored for goods smuggled out of U.S. military post-exchange operations, as well as foreign currency.",
      "In 1973, when U.S. military and South Korean officials met to discuss issues in camp towns, a U.S. Army officer said that the Army policy on prostitution was \u201ctotal suppression,\u201d but \u201cthis is not being done in Korea,\u201d according to declassified U.S. military documents.",
      "Instead, the U.S. military focused on protecting troops from contracting venereal disease.",
      "The women described how they were gathered for monthly classes where South Korean officials praised them as \u201cdollar-earning patriots\u201d while U.S. officers urged them to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. The women had to be tested twice a week; those testing positive were detained for medical treatment.",
      "Under rules U.S. military and South Korean officials worked out, camp town women had to carry registration and V.D. test cards and to wear numbered badges or name tags, according to unsealed documents and former comfort women.",
      "The U.S. military conducted routine inspections at the camp town clubs, keeping photo files of the women at base clinics to help infected soldiers identify contacts. The detained included not only women found to be infected, but also those identified as contacts or those lacking a valid test card during random inspections.",
      "They were held in facilities with barred windows and heavily dosed with penicillin. The women interviewed by The Times all remembered these places with dread, recalling colleagues who collapsed or died from penicillin shock.",
      "South Korea has never come to terms with the story of its camp town women, in part because of the steadfast alliance between Seoul and Washington. The subject remains far more taboo than discussions of ",
      " forced into sexual slavery by Japan.",
      "\u201cWe were just like comfort women for the Japanese military,\u201d Ms. Cho said. \u201cThey had to take Japanese soldiers and we American G.I.s.\u201d",
      "None of the government documents unsealed in recent years revealed any evidence to suggest that South Korea was directly involved in recruiting the women for American troops, unlike many women forced into sexual slavery under Japanese occupation.",
      "But unlike the victims of the Japanese military \u2014 ",
      " as symbols of Korea\u2019s suffering under colonial rule \u2014 these women say they have had to live in shame and silence.",
      "South Koreans began to pay more attention to the issue of sexual exploitation in camp towns after a woman named Yun Geum-i was brutally sexually assaulted and viciously murdered by an American soldier in 1992.",
      "Between 1960 and 2004, American soldiers were found guilty of killing 11 sex workers in South Korea, according to a list compiled by the advocacy group Saewoomtuh.",
      "The U.S. military declined to comment on the Supreme Court ruling or the women\u2019s claims. \u201cWe do not condone any type of behavior that violates South Korean laws, rules or directives and have implemented good order and discipline measures,\u201d its spokesman, Col. Isaac Taylor, said by email.",
      "Camp towns faded with South Korea\u2019s rapid economic development.",
      "Though former camp town women want to bring their case to the United States, their legal strategy there is unclear, as is what recourse they may find.",
      "In a psychiatric report that Ms. Park submitted to the South Korean court in 2021 as evidence, she compared her life with \u201cwalking constantly on thin ice\u201d out of fear that others might learn about her past. Her arms and thighs show scars from self-inflicted wounds.",
      "Under the South Korean court ruling, Ms. Park and others were each paid between $2,270 and $5,300, which did little to ease their financial distress.",
      "Choi Gwi-ja, 77, fought back tears when she described multiple abortions she and other women endured because of the prejudice against biracial children in South Korea. Her voice quavered recalling women who killed themselves after G.I.s who had taken them as common-law wives subsequently abandoned them and their children.",
      "She recalled how officials once urged the women, many of them illiterate like her, to earn dollars, promising them free apartments in their old age if they would sell their bodies for money at the camp towns. \u201cIt was all a fraud,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cRoe was, at the least, a very close case,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote in the three-page memorandum, which included reflections on the power of precedent, the court\u2019s legitimacy and the best way to address a cutting dissent.",
      "The document is part of an enormous trove of the private papers of Justice John Paul Stevens released on Tuesday by the Library of Congress. They provide a panoramic inside look at the justices at work on thousands of cases, including ",
      " and the 1992 abortion case, ",
      ".",
      "The papers are studded with candid and occasionally caustic remarks, sometimes echoing current concerns about the court\u2019s power and authority.",
      "In the Casey decision, Justice Kennedy joined a controlling opinion with Justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and David H. Souter that saved the core of the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe in 1973.",
      "In June, ",

      "There was, for instance, an apparent leak, one that prompted Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to write a stern note to all of the law clerks on June 10, 1992. The current issue of Newsweek, the chief justice wrote, \u201ccontains a purported account of what is happening inside the court in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\u201d",
      "The article, attributing its information to \u201csources\u201d and \u201cclerks,\u201d said that \u201cat least three of the nine justices are planning to draft opinions in Casey\u201d and predicted, correctly, that the decision would be released on June 29.",
      "Chief Justice Rehnquist admonished the clerks to follow a rule in the court\u2019s code of conduct, which said, \u201cThere should be as little communication as possible between the clerk and representatives of the press.\u201d He added, underlining the last three words: \u201cIn the case of any matter pending before the court, the least possible communication is none at all.\u201d",
      "Researchers will be studying the Stevens papers for decades, and only small glimpses were possible in a day\u2019s scrutiny of a selection of them. But those glimpses made clear that the current turmoil at the court has historical analogues.",
      "In 2000, for instance, when the court ",
      " in Bush v. Gore by a 5-to-4 vote, members of the majority wrote scathing private memos protesting what they called unduly harsh language in the dissents.",
      " ended this way: \u201cAlthough we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year\u2019s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation\u2019s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\u201d",
      "In a memo to his colleagues on Dec. 12, 2000, the day the decision was issued, Justice Kennedy, who had voted with the majority, appeared wounded.",

      "He added, \u201cThe dissents, permit me to say, in effect try to coerce the majority by trashing the court themselves, thereby making their dire, and I think unjustified, predictions a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d",
      "Justice Antonin Scalia, who had also voted with the majority, said he was \u201cthe last person to complain that dissents should not be thorough and hard hitting.\u201d",
      "But he said he could not \u201chelp but observe that those of my colleagues who were protesting so vigorously that the court\u2019s judgment today will do irreparable harm have spared no pains \u2014 in a veritable blizzard of separate dissents \u2014 to assist that result.\u201d",
      "At an earlier stage of the case, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who dissented in Bush v. Gore, urged his colleagues to stay away from the dispute, recalling the role that Supreme Court justices had played on a commission created to resolve the contested presidential election of 1876.",
      "\u201cRather than the court lending the process legitimacy, the process damaged the legitimacy of the court,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote. \u201cI doubt very much that our intervention would assure anyone that the process had worked more fairly. Rather, I fear that history could repeat itself, were we to intervene now.\u201d",
      "In statements after the Supreme Court\u2019s recent abortion decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. has said that attacks on the court\u2019s legitimacy, as opposed to its reasoning, should be out of bounds.",
      "In the 1992 memo containing his \u201clate-night musings,\u201d which was addressed to Justice Souter and copied to Justices O\u2019Connor and Stevens, Justice Kennedy also reflected on the court\u2019s legitimacy in the context of abortion.",
      "He appeared troubled by aspects of ",
      ", which said public opinion should not affect the court\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou can fend off the chief,\u201d Justice Kennedy told Justice Souter, \u201cby stating that we are not concerned with preserving our legitimacy for our own sake but for the sake of the Constitution. Thus, when we speak of the principled character of our decisions, we mean that they are informed by precedent, logic and the traditions of our people, all with reference to our constitutional heritage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must be clear,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat we are not guided by expediency, contemporary attitudes or our own morality.\u201d",

      "The only clue to the gambit was in the title of the otherwise obscure hodgepodge of a bill: \u201cThe Breaking the Gridlock Act.\u201d",
      "But the 45-page legislation, introduced without fanfare in January by a little-known Democrat, Representative Mark DeSaulnier of California, is part of a confidential, previously unreported, strategy Democrats have been plotting for months to quietly smooth the way for action by Congress to avert a devastating federal default if ",
      " talks remain deadlocked.",
      "With a possible default now projected ",
      ", Democrats on Tuesday began taking steps to deploy the secret weapon they have been holding in reserve. They started the process of trying to force a debt-limit increase bill to the floor through a so-called ",
      " that could bypass Republican leaders who have refused to raise the ceiling unless President Biden agrees to spending cuts and policy changes.",
      "\u201cHouse Democrats are working to make sure we have all options at our disposal to avoid a default,\u201d Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, wrote in a letter he sent to colleagues on Tuesday. \u201cThe filing of a debt ceiling measure to be brought up on the discharge calendar preserves an important option. It is now time for MAGA Republicans to act in a bipartisan manner to pay America\u2019s bills without extreme conditions.\u201d",
      "An emergency rule Democrats introduced on Tuesday, during a pro forma session held while the House is in recess, would start the clock on a process that would allow them to begin collecting signatures as soon as May 16 on such a petition, which can force action on a bill if a majority of members sign on. The open-ended rule would provide a vehicle to bring Mr. DeSaulnier\u2019s bill to the floor and amend it with a Democratic proposal \u2014 which has yet to be written \u2014 to resolve the debt limit crisis.",
      "The strategy is no silver bullet, and Democrats concede it is a long shot. Gathering enough signatures to force a bill to the floor would take at least five Republicans willing to cross party lines if all Democrats signed on, a threshold that Democrats concede will be difficult to reach. They have yet to settle on the debt ceiling proposal itself, and for the strategy to succeed, Democrats would likely need to negotiate with a handful of mainstream Republicans to settle on a measure they could accept.",
      "A handful of hard-right Republicans explicitly warned their colleagues on Tuesday not to go down that path. \u201cHouse Republicans: don\u2019t defect!\u201d Senator Mike Lee of Utah wrote on Twitter.",
      "Still, Democrats argue that the prospect of a successful effort could force House Republicans into a more acceptable deal. And Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen\u2019s announcement on Monday that a potential default was only weeks away spurred Democratic leaders to act.",
      "House Democratic leaders have for months played down the possibility of initiating a discharge petition as a way out of the stalemate. They are hesitant to budge from the party position, which Mr. Biden has articulated repeatedly, that Republicans should agree to raise the debt limit with no conditions or concessions on spending cuts.",
      "But behind the scenes, they were simultaneously taking steps to make sure a vehicle was available if needed.",
      "There were no signs on Tuesday of any momentum toward even a temporary resolution. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, brushed aside the idea of putting off a confrontation by passing a short-term debt limit increase, telling reporters: \u201cWe should not kick the can down the road.\u201d",
      "And Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, reiterated that he intended to leave the negotiations to Mr. Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, again dashing the private hopes of some Democrats that the veteran Republican would ultimately cut a deal with them to allow the debt ceiling to be lifted, ",
      ".",
      "\u201cThere is no solution in the Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.",
      "The White House had no public comment on the discharge effort, according to Karine Jean-Pierre, the press secretary. Mr. Biden is scheduled next week to host Mr. McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House to discuss raising the debt limit. His goal at that meeting, a senior administration official said, will be to stress the importance of averting default and creating a separate negotiation to address other budget issues.",
      "The discharge petition process can be time-consuming and complicated, so House Democrats who devised the strategy started early and carefully crafted their legislative vehicle. Insiders privately refer to the measure as a \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d bill \u2014 one intended to be referred to every single House committee in order to keep open as many opportunities as possible for forcing it to the floor.",
      "It would create a task force to help grandparents raising grandchildren, create a federal strategy for reducing earthquake risks, change the name of a law that governs stock trading by members of Congress, extend small business loans, protect veterans from the I.R.S., authorize a new Pentagon grant program to protect nonprofit organizations against terrorist attacks and more. The legislation was so broad and eclectic that it was referred to 20 committees, where it has sat idle for months. That was the point.",
      "Mr. DeSaulnier\u2019s intent was never to pass the elements of the bill, though he favors them all. It was to create what is known on Capitol Hill as a shell of a bill that would ultimately serve as the basis for a discharge petition \u2014 and a way out of the debt limit standoff.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a way to be prepared,\u201d said Mr. DeSaulnier, a former member of the Rules Committee who worked with Democratic procedural experts to craft legislation that could provide a debt-limit escape hatch. \u201cI anticipated there would be these problems with the Republican caucus, whether it was abortion or the debt limit. I think it was the responsible thing as a legislator to do.\u201d",
      "Democrats say the beauty of Mr. DeSaulnier\u2019s bill \u2014 which Republicans have ignored \u2014 is that it long ago passed the threshold of being held in committee for at least 30 days, the minimum length of time to initiate a discharge petition to force action on legislation. Even so, in a memo sent to members on Tuesday, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis projected that even if Democrats were able to draw enough support for their plan and advance it without further delay, the measure could take until June 12 or 13 to clear Congress \u2014 many days beyond the earliest date Ms. Yellen has warned the debt limit could be reached.",
      "Democrats said the fact that their bill would fall under the jurisdiction of so many committees gave them several options for moving forward.",
      "Mr. DeSaulnier was picked to sponsor the measure because his low profile meant there was likely to be little attention to his bill. In contrast, any legislation introduced by Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, would have drawn attention immediately, and Republicans might have been able to take action to derail it.",
      "Discharge petitions have spurred action in the past by prompting House leaders to move on issues rather than lose control of the floor through a guerrilla legislative effort. But the procedure is rarely successful and has produced a law in only a handful of cases, including the approval of major bipartisan campaign finance legislation in 2002. Congressional leaders of both parties have been disdainful of such efforts, since they effectively wrest control of the House floor from the majority.",
      "Democrats say that the current situation, with a default looming, showed that they were taking prudent precautions with Mr. DeSaulnier\u2019s bill. Besides thwarting gridlock, the legislation says its purpose is also \u201cto advance common-sense policy priorities.\u201d",

      "Top economic and legal officials at the White House, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department have made that theory a subject of intense and unresolved debate in recent months, according to several people familiar with the discussions.",
      "It is unclear whether President Biden would support such a move, which would have serious ramifications for the economy and almost undoubtedly elicit legal challenges from Republicans. Continuing to issue debt in that situation would avoid an immediate disruption in consumer demand by maintaining government payments, but borrowing costs are likely to soar, at least temporarily.",

House Republicans have refused to raise or suspend the debt ceiling unless Mr. Biden accepts spending cuts, fossil fuel supports and a repeal of Democratic climate policies, contained in a bill that narrowly cleared the chamber last week.",

Lawyers at the White House and the Justice and Treasury Departments have never issued formal opinions on the question. And legal scholars disagree about the constitutionality of such a move.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution\u2019s text bars the federal government from defaulting on the debt \u2014 even a little, even for a short while,\u201d Garrett Epps, a constitutional scholar at the University of Oregon\u2019s law school, ",

      "But inside the administration, it remains an open question what Treasury would do if Congress does not raise the limit in time \u2014 because, many officials say, the law is unclear and so is the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to tax and spend.",
      "Officials who support invoking the 14th Amendment and continuing to issue new debt contend the government would be exposed to lawsuits either way. If it fails to continue paying its bills after the X-date, it could be sued by anyone who is not paid on time in the event of a default.",

      "There is a broad consensus on both sides of the debate that the move risks roiling financial markets. It is likely to cause a surge in short-term borrowing costs because investors would demand a premium to buy debt that could be invalidated by a court.",

      "\u201cThe extraordinary uncertainty created by the constitutional crisis leads to a sell-off in financial markets until the Supreme Court rules,\u201d Mr. Zandi wrote in March.

      "HOUSTON \u2014 After a manhunt that stretched to the Mexican border, heavily armed Texas and federal officers on Tuesday arrested the man who they believe fatally shot five people in a neighborhood dispute outside the town of Cleveland, Texas, officials said.",
      "The suspect, Francisco Oropesa, was \u201ccaught hiding in a closet underneath some laundry\u201d in a home a few miles from the site of the Friday shooting in San Jacinto County, said Greg Capers, the county sheriff.",
      "Mr. Oropesa, 38, an immigrant from Mexico ",
      ", was charged with five counts of murder and was being held on $5 million bond, Sheriff Capers said. Mr. Oropesa was being transferred back to a San Jacinto County jail on Tuesday night.",
      "Sheriff Capers declined to say who owned the home near the town of Cut and Shoot where Mr. Oropesa was found but said that he had not resisted arrest. Property records indicated that the home belonged to one of his relatives.",
      "\u201cSomebody got a tip,\u201d Sheriff Capers said in a Tuesday night news conference. Then tactical officers from several agencies \u201cmeandered over there and found that tip to be true.\u201d",
      "Officials said that those connected to the home, in Montgomery County, were being questioned but that no one else had been taken into custody as of Tuesday evening.",
      "For four days, state and federal law enforcement officials had been searching for Mr. Oropesa in the thick woods around his home outside Cleveland, in neighboring counties and as far south as the border with Mexico, where, officials believed, he might be trying to flee.",
      "But in the end, officers found Mr. Oropesa \u2014 whose face stared out from large Spanish-language posters around San Jacinto County, about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Houston \u2014 roughly 10 miles away from the scene of the killings.",
      "Jimmy Paul, an assistant special agent in charge with the F.B.I., said that the tip that had led to the arrest came in at 5:15 p.m. on Tuesday; Mr. Oropesa was arrested shortly after, at 6:30 p.m. Mr. Paul did not elaborate on the nature of the tip or who had left it. Officials had offered rewards totaling $80,000 for information leading to Mr. Oropesa\u2019s arrest.",
      "Officials said he had been taken into custody without incident by a team that included officers from the U.S. Marshals Service, the Texas Department of Public Safety and a tactical unit from the Border Patrol.",
      "The killings occurred late Friday. Officials said Mr. Oropesa had been firing a gun that night in his front yard outside Cleveland, on a plot of land smaller than an acre in a row of similarly sized properties along a rutted dirt road. His immediate neighbors, a family from Honduras, complained about the noise, to both Mr. Oropesa and the police via 911, around 11:30 p.m.",
      "Officers did not immediately go to the area, ",
      ". Soon after the complaints, officials said, Mr. Oropesa could be seen on a doorbell video entering his neighbor Wilson Garcia\u2019s home, armed with an AR-15-style rifle.",
      "Five people were fatally shot inside the home, according to the F.B.I.: Mr. Garcia\u2019s wife, Sonia Guzman, 25; his son, Daniel Enrique Laso, 9; Diana Velazquez Alvarado, 21; Juliza Molina Rivera, 31; and Jose Jonathan Casarez, 18.",
      "Officials declined to answer questions on Tuesday about the speed of the response to the killings.",
      "The top official in San Jacinto County, Fritz Faulkner, said in a telephone interview that he had been alerted to the arrest shortly after it happened. The killings had shocked the community, he said, and the county was now, after several days, finally able to rest easy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just elated,\u201d Mr. Faulkner said.",

      "CLEVELAND, Texas \u2014 The sound of gunfire \u2014 whether from hunting, or target practice, or celebration \u2014 is common in much of rural America. Perhaps nowhere is this more true than in Texas, where the occasional volley rarely raises alarm.",
      "So when someone from an immigrant family from Honduras called 911 on Friday night to report that their next-door neighbor was shooting from his small property in San Jacinto County, the police did not rush to the scene. Officers did not arrive until after the neighbor had stormed into the family\u2019s house and killed five people, including a 9-year-old boy, with his AR-15-style rifle.",
      "On Tuesday, after an extensive manhunt, officials in Texas said they had arrested the suspect, Francisco Oropesa, 38, just a few miles from where the killings took place. But they were still struggling to understand why such aimless shooting, of the sort common in that part of Texas, had turned into a massacre.",
      "More than 250 officers from a dozen agencies had been on the hunt for Mr. Oropesa, a Mexican immigrant who had been deported four times before. Law enforcement officials had feared that he had been headed to Mexico, or had already arrived there.",
      "The lack of a rapid police response to the family\u2019s initial call for help, around 11:30 p.m., raised questions about how to handle reports of gunfire in Texas, where the ownership of weapons has become less regulated. Some rural officers may also have difficulty distinguishing between noise complaints related to legal and harmless shooting activity and those that represent potential threats.",
      "Texas law affords broad leeway to people firing weapons in rural areas, preventing regulation by local counties on properties larger than 10 acres. Counties may explicitly bar shooting on smaller lots in subdivisions, but many have opted not to do so, relying instead on more general rules preventing recklessness or firing over property lines. Officials in San Jacinto County said that was the law there, and it would have made shooting in the yard, of the kind the family had reported, illegal.",
      "\u201cI get calls all the time for that,\u201d said Roy Rogers, a county constable in San Jacinto County. \u201cI go down there and I check it out. If they\u2019re discharging the weapon in a safe manner, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "The gunfire on Friday took place along Walter Drive, a rutted dirt road outside of the small city of Cleveland, where recent migrants and longtime residents live in closely packed quarter-acre plots, a half-hewn suburban subdivision in the midst of dense woodland.",
      "Like many parts of Texas just outside major cities, San Jacinto County, about 50 miles from downtown Houston, has been rapidly growing.",
      "Residents regularly complained about neighbors firing their weapons, both to the sheriff\u2019s office and on a private community Facebook page, where posts about gunfire go back years.",
      "\u201cEveryone back here\u2019s got a gun,\u201d said Dale Tiller, who lives around the corner from the street where the shooting occurred and runs what he calls a neighborhood watch. He said there had been \u201ca thousand\u201d complaints about gunfire to the sheriff\u2019s office, and that when officers do respond, it often takes them \u201cover an hour\u201d to arrive.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be in Galveston drinking a margarita by the time they get here, that\u2019s how long it takes them,\u201d he said.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office did not respond to a request for records of 911 calls regarding Mr. Oropesa\u2019s address. Officials have previously said he had ",
      ", but it was not clear whether he had ever been told to stop by the police.",
      "The frequency with which gunfire was reported, particularly in this area of potholed roads and moldering homes, may have contributed to an apparent lack of urgency in the response to the initial 911 call.",
      "After the killings, Mr. Oropesa fled on foot, officials said. The sheriff, Greg Capers, and his deputies began the search through the neighborhood and the surrounding dense woods where wet, muddy ground presented difficulties for some vehicles.",
      "His deputies were joined by agents from the F.B.I. as well as officers from the state police and sheriff\u2019s deputies from surrounding counties. But the trail of Mr. Oropesa quickly turned cold, after he dropped his cellphone and some clothing on Saturday, officials said.",
      "And there were early stumbles: Looking for assistance from the public, the F.B.I. disseminated an image of Mr. Oropesa on Sunday that turned out to be the wrong person.",
      "On Tuesday, large posters bearing the correct image of the man being sought stared back at drivers from several intersections around San Jacinto County, with text in Spanish offering steep rewards \u2014 now totaling $80,000 \u2014 for information leading to his arrest.",
      "The search had the entire community of San Jacinto County on edge. The county judge, Fritz Faulkner, said he found his wife sitting on the couch with a shotgun when he returned from being out on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re just in shock,\u201d he said.",
      "Along Walter Drive on Monday, several young men came to feed unrestrained dogs around the house where the shooting took place. A horse grazed in the grass among chickens on the property where Mr. Oropesa lived with a woman whom the authorities have described as his wife. At one point, a pickup truck left the residence, kicking up dust around the television cameras nearby.",
      "Later, residents gathered for a vigil and placed flowers at the foot of a tree outside the victims\u2019 home. Higher up on the tree was a fading old sign, a kind of no trespassing notice: \u201cWarning: if you are found here tonight, you will be found here tomorrow,\u201d it read, along with an image of two handguns.",
      "The country is full of gun owners, some of whom fire their weapons on their own property. What is unique in Texas is a combination of legal permissiveness, social tolerance and increasing density in rural areas where the freedom to fire guns has been a traditional part of life.",
      "\u201cWe had some developments going in that were smaller acreages, two and a half acres and less, and people were putting cans on their fence posts and shooting and the bullets were going across their neighbors\u2019 property,\u201d said Hoppy Haden, the county judge in Caldwell County, a rural area south of Austin. \u201cWe chose to regulate that, and you would not believe the amount of pushback we got.\u201d",
      "Despite the new rules there limiting gunfire on small subdivision plots, Mr. Haden said the local sheriff still received complaints about shots fired. Enforcing the new rules can be a challenge. \u201cSomebody either has to video them doing it, or the sheriff\u2019s department has to see them doing it,\u201d he said, likening it to speeding. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating for us.\u201d",
      "No such regulations have been adopted in San Jacinto County, according to Mr. Faulkner, the top elected county official. But that does not mean that residents can legally fire their guns on small plots of land, he added.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a quarter-acre lot,\u201d he said of the area where Friday\u2019s shooting took place. \u201cThat\u2019s not legal in San Jacinto County or anywhere else in Texas. Just because you\u2019ve got a little land doesn\u2019t mean you can be shooting.\u201d",
      "Mr. Rogers, the local constable, said he often found himself debating the Second Amendment with gun owners when responding to neighbors\u2019 complaints over gunfire. Some are aggressive, he said. \u201cThey have the constitutional right and they start pleading their Second Amendment rights to me,\u201d he said.",
      "In any case, the rules about boundaries and recklessness would generally preclude firing on small lots, said Richard Hayes, a lawyer specializing in firearms cases in Texas.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you could shoot on a quarter acre and it not be reckless,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s theoretically not a safe direction to discharge a firearm on such a small piece of property.\u201d",
      "Mr. Faulkner, 63, a lifelong San Jacinto County resident, said he had personal experience with the dangers of errant gunfire between neighbors. In 2004, he said, his wife had been struck in the knee while out pulling weeds on their property. She had been hunched over, he said, and the bullet came within inches of her head.",
      "No one was ever directly connected to the shooting, though Mr. Faulkner said he believed it was a neighbor who has since died. \u201cI heard he was shooting at a squirrel,\u201d he said."

      "A Utah state judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a new law, one day before it was scheduled to take effect, that would have banned abortion clinics and potentially put a halt to most abortions in the state.",
      "Abortion is legal in Utah ",
      ", and after that only in limited circumstances. But legislators have been trying in recent years to further restrict the procedure. A state law which would ban nearly all abortions is suspended while the Utah Supreme Court considers whether abortion is protected in the Constitution.",
      "While the more stringent ban is temporarily blocked by the legal challenge, the Legislature, dominated by Republicans, passed another bill known as ",
      " that was signed into law by the Republican governor and zeroed in on something else: abortion clinics, where 95 percent of all abortions are performed in the state.",
      "Among other provisions, the law makes it a crime to provide abortion anywhere other than a hospital. Abortion clinics would lose their licenses if they performed the procedure. And even if they stopped performing abortions, no new licenses would be issued after May.",
      "The law, ",
      ", was scheduled to take effect on Wednesday. The Planned Parenthood Association of Utah \u2014 which runs three of the state\u2019s four clinics \u2014 sued, arguing that the law would all but eliminate abortion, and that it was designed to circumvent the pending case on the more stringent ban.",
      "On Tuesday, ",
      " of Utah\u2019s Third Judicial District agreed with Planned Parenthood. In his 22-page ruling, he wrote that the organization had offered evidence suggesting that abortion clinics had been unreasonably singled out, and that the state\u2019s rationale for the new law was \u201cnebulous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is nothing before the court to indicate that an injunction would be adverse to the public interest,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "A spokesman for Sean D. Reyes, Utah\u2019s attorney general, declined to comment, citing pending litigation.",
      "In a statement, Sarah Stoesz, interim president and chief executive of the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, said: \u201cWhile we welcome this victory, the threat to Utahns\u2019 health and personal freedom remains dire as politicians continue to undermine our judicial process and fight the injunction against Utah\u2019s trigger ban.\u201d",
      "The practical effect, for now, is that abortion services can continue uninterrupted at the state\u2019s four clinics, three of which are in the metropolitan Salt Lake City area.",
      "Hospitals in Utah typically do not provide abortions outside of extenuating circumstances, such as when the patient\u2019s health is seriously threatened, in cases of severe fetal anomalies, or in the rare instances when accusations of rape or incest are reported to the police, said Hannah Swanson, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood. Public money cannot be used to finance abortions, and neither can private or public insurance.",
      "So if the law had gone into effect, Ms. Swanson said, then people from the Salt Lake City area seeking abortion services would have had to drive some 360 miles to the nearest clinic in Glenwood Springs, Colo.",
      "Residents in the less-populated southern part of the state would have had to go to Las Vegas, or other places in Colorado.",
      "Still, Judge Stone\u2019s ruling is not the final word. Planned Parenthood ",
      " after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer.",
      "In that case, the plaintiffs contend that the law violates the right to privacy as laid out in the Utah Constitution, and the right to determine family composition, among other arguments."
