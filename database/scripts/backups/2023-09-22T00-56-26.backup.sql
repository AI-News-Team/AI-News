The birds were not allowed to soar over the mountains because of the weak air flows by November. ","Mr. The animals were trapped in crates and chauffeured over the Alps. ","Mr has a private coach service. He came up with the idea to show the birds a new way to migrate. ","Humans and birds were in flight school at Lake Constance this summer. They hope to reach Spain''s southern Atlantic coast by October. ","The new route goes past the Alps and is three times longer than the previous one. Flying at a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour, the trip is expected to take about six weeks, as opposed to the two to reach Tuscany. ","Mr said that they were optimistic that it would work.

A decade had passed since he first saw them, but that day in 2011 he saw a family of nine walk through the forest, with children on their backs and arrows taller than him. ","For many years, logging companies said the isolated Indigenous group was a myth. But now Mr. Behind slim trees, Candor was recording the first ever video of them. ","Claiton Gabriel Silva said that when he was done, he cursed the loggers and dared them to say the tribe didn''t exist. Mr. Candor had tears in his eyes. ","Mr. Candor is one of a diminishing number of people who have been hired by the Brazilian government to investigate some of the most untouched parts of the Amazon to find evidence of groups who have lived largely unseen and uncontacted for generations. ","It''s not the job of the tribes to be contacted, it''s the job of the tribes to be protected. There needs to be proof that isolated groups exist before the land can be placed off limits to outsiders. Mr. Candor tries to spot the tribes, without being noticed, to allow them to remain isolated, and to protect himself. ","Mr said that his curiosity is great. It was candor, said Candor. Over 35 years, he has led hundreds of expeditions into the forest, catching malaria many times, and surviving two attempts on his life, one in which an Indigenous man fired arrows at his team. ","Mr. Candor found evidence of four tiny civilizations, each of which has its own language, culture and stories. The Piripkura are the smallest known tribe in Brazil and have three remaining survivors. The area of rainforest he has led to legal protections for is larger than Puerto Rico, and makes him one of the most effective figures working on Amazon preservation today. ","The rainforest needs protection as it fast approaches a tipping point that could transform large areas into grasslands and turn a place that is a net source of heat-trapping gases into a net source of ozone-depleting pollutants.","He has had a lot of enemies as a result of the work. He talked about the politicians and the farmers who tried to bribe and kill him, as he drove along a dirt road at 50 miles-an-hour into the forest. His bulletproof vest has a shiny 9 millimeter pistol in it. ","He said that he was not scared. He grinned and said, \"What worries me are snakes.\" ","He filmed a video of a group of people who live in isolation in Brazil, one of the 115 groups considered to be the most isolated in the country. A lack of proof means that about a third of those groups are not as protected as they could be. Candor, who discovered how to find forest dwellers who don''t want to be located, is critical to their survival. ","Mr. When Candor was a kid, he and his family moved to the Amazon. It was the 1960s, and his parents decided to colonize the rainforest after being called to do so by the country''s military dictatorship. They would help the government get a plot of land for their trouble in order to subdue the green hell. ","Three years later, Mr. The mother of Candor died. His family was split up and he was adopted by a group of rubber tappers. He stopped going to school to learn how to survive in the wilderness. ","The military government had fallen in 1988, and Brazil was in the process of approving a new constitution that recognized the rights of Indigenous people over their land. The government needed to find new experts who could protect them in the rainforest. Mr. Candor had earned a reputation for making friends with Indigenous people in the forest, and he was 28 years old at the time. He was hired by the government. ","Mr. Candor was quick to show a knack for the job. He learned how to notice the differences between those who chose to live alone and those who chose to live together. The Brazil nut shells and bunches of toxic plants were left by streams and used to stun fish in order to catch them. ","A lot of the time, the cut-off branches tell a lot. A person''s height, and the direction of the cut, can tell if they are walking in one direction or the other. A closer inspection of the machete might show how sharp it was. People living in isolation cannot sharpen the machetes they steal. ","Then, there are the signs of the man in front of the building. Candor is not able to explain. Something tells him to stop, and then he finds something, such as a shelter, a ceramic pot, or the leftovers of a meal. Maybe he can hear what birds are saying, like some people claim, or maybe he has an Indigenous man''s spirit inside of him, as a priestess once told him. ","His deputy, Rodrigo Ayres, said it was a spiritual thing. We can''t explain a mode of communication that is inside the forest. Jair led his first expedition on his own in 1989. The government had been seeking for four years to find two members of the Piripkura, they were found by Candor. The tribe named them butterfly because of how fast they flew through the forest. They only had a few items that they needed to survive: fire, a couple of hammocks, and a machete. ","He said that they need a home, a car, and a bunch of stuff. Two guys are living happily with nothing, no clothes, no supermarket, no water, or electricity bill, and they meet you. Candor began detaching as well. He didn''t get to attend his wedding in 1992 due to an expedition that ran longer than expected. The bride did not want him to come back. He had two sons with a different woman. He comes home about eight times a year. ","Mr, I''d like to speak with you. Candor has lost a sense of safety. An Informant warned him of a group of men who were going to attack him. ","He was at a base in the forest that was being run by the government. It wasn''t possible for the authorities to help. He and his team decided to protect the base even though his son was there. His son and six other people were given guns. His son was the only person in the world who wore a bulletproof vest. ","Everyone was told to stand in an arrowhead formation, so that they wouldn''t hit each other, and shoot down a slope. He said he watched it in a movie. ","The men broke the lock on the gate. Mr. They said that they fired back because Candor and his crew heard shots. The invaders were killed. The other people ran away. The leader of the loggers was arrested, but there wasn''t evidence that they were carrying guns. ","In 2020 there will be one of Mr. Candor was killed by an arrow shot by a member of a tribe that he had been watching for decades. Last year, a British journalist and a specialist on isolated tribes were killed for their work, Bruno and Dom, for helping to protect land that had been preserved for isolated tribes. ","Mr. Candor is close with both of the Indigenous experts who have died, and he knows they could have been him. He thinks he only has another four or five years to live.

He was so good at remembering that in 1929 he gave up his job as a journalist in Moscow and joined the circus. He was capable of reciting lists of numbers and poems in foreign languages, even strings of random syllables that were called out to him by the audience. He had a world filled with imagery and sensations. He said he thought of the number 87 as a fat woman and a man twirling his mustache, but that it was also a terrible affliction. The barrage of specific inputs didn''t allow him to generalize. Communication with other people was exhausting. He had to actively destroy the thing in his mind in order to get rid of it. Gathering bits together into a coherent picture can be hard if you''re confronted with a singular meaning. The blur of abstraction is required in remembrance, in contrast to memorization. In his book \"The Rigor of Angels\" William Egginton states that a perfect memory can begin to resemble \"total forgetting\". Shereshevsky makes only a small part in the book, but his plight opens up a portal into thinking about space. The life and work of three figures, including a German theoretical physicist, are explored in \"The Rigor of Angels,\" an ambitious, yet also nicely written, book about the ultimate nature of reality. The three men are all different, and Egginton brought them all together in one book. They did not want to presume that there was a reality, out there, that wasn''t connected to our attempts to know it. ","Egginton puts it succinctly, \"Letting go of what we think must be real is what the formidable creativity of their work was.\" It''s very difficult to do this. Albert Einstein had trouble doing it, his name is synonymous with genius. He let go up to a point, though in 1915 it was only up to a point. Egginton writes that his theory of relativity required him to disregard what everyone knew about space and time in favor of what the data were telling him. Einstein inserted a constant cosmological constant to keep his fiction that the universe remained a constant size, because his calculations told him that the universe was either shrinking or expanding. ","During the 1920s, Einstein and Heisenberg clashed over the nature of reality, which Heisenberg thought was the ultimate nature of reality. Egginton describes how a smooth continuity of matter''s movement is replaced by violent quantum fluctuations, which Einstein refused to accept because he felt that particles like electrons would follow a distinct path only once they were observed. Heisenberg is described as someone who seemed to have carved out both of his eyes in order to see more in Benjamn Labatut''s novel \"When We Cease to Understand the World\". All three men were fascinated by paradoxes, in which the two options seemed at once absolutely necessary and utterly impossible, when we mix up different modes of thinking. If we define the race in terms of a distance between them that is infinitely smaller than the rest, Achilles won''t catch the tortoise who gets a head start. The paradoxes come from how we imagine the race in the first place; in an actual race, Achilles will eventually catch the tortoise. ","A book about the position of an electron is about the smallest of things. It is about the possibility of free will, as well as the biggest of things, the universe. Egginton is able to work with ideas by putting them in the lives of his characters. In the 1930s, Heisenberg seemed unable to grasp the monster that was the Nazi regime, as his scientific research was so bold, yet his political engagements were cautious and passive. Egginton believes that Heisenberg''s behavior may not have been as weird as he seems to have made it out to be. Egginton suggests that Heisenberg had a mode of thinking that made him such a brilliant scientist, and that it was a failure to recognize an actual evil in the world and react strongly against it. ","In the example of the young man who was afflicted with powers of total recall, being so focused on details came at the expense of the bigger picture. Borges says Funes is not very good at thinking. Egginton shows how thinking can get us into trouble. Sometimes we can get so enamored with our ideas that we project them onto the world and forget about all the other things. Egginton encourages us to recognize all of these complicated truths as part of our reality. We are not finite beings whose perspective will always be limited, but our limits are what give rise to possibility. When we want to observe, we put our freedom into nature. William Egginton wrote the novel \"THE RIGOR OF ANGELS.\" He said, \"We are, and ever will be, active participants in the universe we discover.\" $30 is the price for Pantheon. "]');

Their lives changed dramatically after their daughter, Sirena, was born, as she is already climbing ropes and trying her first tricks as an acrobat. Despite their absence, the circus continues to be reinvented with new performers and new ideas, and they now spend less time with it. ","Many artists from all over the world are connected with the Sea Clown Sailing Circus. Some join the crew for a few days while others join for the whole summer. A core group of around seven or 8 people are attempting to bring the circus to a greater appreciation by roaming freely from one island to another, and also by producing more more meaningful, and more philosophyly engaging, shows. ","I joined the Sea Clowns again for a month in the summer of 2021, and during that time, they were doing a show based on Plato''s allegory of the cave. I witnessed firsthand how devoted the performers are to their craft. The Sea Clowns are disciplined in their preparations, even though their performances often feel impromptu. A tremendous degree of skill and training is required for every act, from acrobatic shows and fire juggling to aerial rope tricks and slacklining. They love to learn. ","Being a part of the crew requires being good at a variety of entertainment activities such as sailing, music, and circus acts. But what is most important is being able to express enough humor, kindness and respect to live in proximity with a crew of curious artists each day without creating tensions. ","It is a challenge to adapt to life on a small budget. Fred would say at the end of every show that they had to survive or die by the hat, and that the public was invited to donate funds for the survival of the Sea Clowns. ","A street artist''s life is very delicate, like a tightrope act, juggling with knives, or sailing through a storm. For most of the crew, there is nothing to give them a sense of freedom.

He comprehensively covers McMurtry''s long career as a rare book dealer both in Georgetown and in Archer City, and he also makes the point that McMurtry''s novels had to be seen as one long stream. McMurtry compared ranching to book collecting. He wrote that booksellers herd books instead of herding cattle. McMurtry was known as an important American writer because of the way he herding words into little paragraphlike clusters. He received two awards for his work, a Pulitzer Prize for \"Lonesome Dove\" and a Academy Award for \"Brokeback Mountain\" with his friend and frequent writing partner Diana Ossana. He is important because of how closely he observed the decimation of the old ways of life and he was able to figure out the national migration from rural to urban existence. In a letter to Ken Kesey, he pointed out that the attention paid to character was what made his books work. The style is nice, plot is nice, structure is okay, social significance is OK, symbolism worms its way in, timeliness is OK, but unless the characters convince and live the book''s got no chance.\"McMurtry met Kesey when both were graduate students in the creative writing McMurtry arrived in 1960. They were a little bit on the competitive side, that''s for sure. McMurtry spent his entire life writing and Kesey became interested in being a countercultural impresario. In Tom Wolfe''s book about Kesey''s road trip with his Merry Pranksters, McMurtry made an amusing appearance, even though he barely drank and did not do drugs. ","He loved them back when women were gaga over McMurtry. He had many serious relationships with several females, including a string of female aides and sometimes lovers. Unlike James Dickey who is featured in this book with a stripper named the Miami Hurricane, McMurtry wasn''t a frequent drinker of groupies. He was married twice, once early and once late. After divorcing his first wife, Jo Scott, he continued to see her for nearly every day and he paid for her classes at Rice University. They talked on the phone all the time. Scott said that he was always the guy that drove everyone home, and all of the women that he was entwined with at one point or another, had no bad words to say about him. McMurtry dedicated his piece, \"Lonesome Dove,\" to both the writer and the journalist, but he was not on the road.

It certainly did for me, after many years of scientific gambles and frustrating setbacks. ","While he was a student at the University of Copenhagen, Eske Willerslev pioneered a method for pulling genetic material out of the soil. He and his colleagues studied a piece of the Siberia permafrost in 2003 and found that some plants were as old as 400,000 years ago. ","It was thought it would be difficult to find anything that was older than the record set by that discovery. But in the year of 2006, that''s the case with Dr. Willerslev and Kurt Kjaer, both scientists from the University of Copenhagen, were in northern Greenland trying to find a cure for Parkinson''s disease. They made their way to a geological formation called Kap Kobenhavn, which was a series of bare hills as barren as a moonscape. Scientists have found plant fossils there that are estimated to be more than 2 million years old. It would have been amazing if it were possible to find a strand of the human genetic material in the sediments. ","Dr. said that if you want to move things forward, you need to take some leaps. Kjaer said something. ","The researchers went to dig up the permafrost to search for some kind of genetic material. They couldn''t find any. ","In the later years, he was a doctor. Willerslev and his colleagues had more success when they looked at younger bones from other parts of the world. A lot of ancient human DNA was discovered that has helped redefine our understanding of our species'' history. ","The researchers upgraded the machines they used to sequence it after tweaking their methods for getting the DNA from ancient samples. They used to take out more Kap Kobenhavn samples as they became better at fishing for genes. ","For a long time they failed. Sometimes they were tantalized by what looked like short bits of the genetic material, called reads, and other times, they were not tantalized at all. Even if some of the young DNA in the region had been contaminated, the researchers wouldn''t be able to say that it wasn''t done in their lab.

","It was a breakthrough, according to Dr. Willerslev said something to the effect that they were going to do it. The researchers lined up the fragments with their genetic information to find out where they belonged on the evolutionary tree. They discovered over 100 different plants, including 78 that had been previously identified, and 24 new ones. The forests dominated by poplar and birch trees had a picture painted of them by the plant DNA. ","Land animals are included, including caribou, hares, mastodons, geese, lemmings and ants. The researchers found a variety of marine species, such as corals and horseshoe crabs. ","The things we imagined were superseded by it. Kjaer said something. ","The researchers looked for clues to the age of the fossils. They found minerals that showed that the Earth''s magnetic field had flipped. The age of the reversals helped the researchers determine that Kap Kobenhavn was around two million years old, but they weren''t able to establish a clear upper limit. I feel like it''s older than I am, as ageosciencesian, according to my gut feeling. Kjaer said something. ","The researchers did not rule out the idea that the DNA came from younger species. The living species have a lot of the same genes as the ancient Birch trees, but they don''t have many of them. The damage to the DNA can only be seen when the molecules have been sitting in the soil for a long period of time. ","According to Tyler Murchie, a researcher who was not involved in the new study, it helps to show that this really is old DNA.","Some of the species they found were surprising to the researchers. Today, they live in the north, like they do across the rest of the north. They have a fossil record that suggests they evolved over a million years ago. Their genetic makeup has doubled their evolutionary history. ","Dalén found mammoth DNA in Siberia that was 1.2 million years old, and was amazed to see mastodons in Greenland. He asked, \"What the hell are they doing up there?\" ","Dr. The closest mastodon fossils are in Nova Scotia, which are 75,000 years old, and much further south than Kap Kobenhavn. He said that it would not be possible to go much further north on dry land. ","The mastodons in Greenland were found to be a branch of the mastodon family tree, which had previously been unknown, thanks to the research done by the Danes. It''s possible that they are ancestors of the mastodons that we know of, or that they represent a new species. Dalén said it was true. ","Mastodons would fit well in a forest in Greenland, similar to what they did in the US. The Canadian forests offer a glimpse into the life of the ancient caribou, a species that is most common on northern tundras. The ocean and land were both warm, as can be seen by the presence of horseshoe crabs in the shallow coastal waters. ","Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues are looking for clues to how all these species were able to thrive a thousand miles north of the Arctic Circle. The trees had to endure half the year in darkness. The secrets of adaptation might be contained in the DNA preserved for two million years. ","The scientists want to know how the DNA fragments managed to last so long and defy expectations. They believe that the DNA can cling to minerals of feldspar and clay, so they can be protected from further damage. ","The research team is working on new methods that they hope will be able to pull even more DNA out of the ancient rocks. Dr. Kjaer and his colleagues hope to break their own record by searching for four million-year-old sites in Canada.

Archaeologists reported a set of 54,000-year-old teeth in a French cave, which may be the oldest evidence of humans in Europe. ","Neanderthals have been living in Europe for more than 100,000 years. The Neanderthals died out over 40,000 years ago, possibly because they were outmaneuvered by modern humans. ","A simple story is undermined by the oldest DNA of modern humans in Europe. It comes from people who have lost a part of their family tree. The ancestors of Europeans and Asians split apart after they were a part of the expansion out of Africa. ","There is no genetic link between the younger remains of hunter-gatherers and these early Europeans.

","It is quite interesting that the first modern humans had a hard time surviving. Posth said it was true. ","Archaeologists gave names to cultures before ancient DNA analysis because of the ways they used to make things. The oldest modern human culture in Europe is known as the Aurignacians, and it was named for the continent''s oldest cave paintings and sculptures. ","A new culture known as the Gravettian arose in Europe about 30,000 years ago as the climate turned cold. The hunters killed woolly mammoths and other big game with spears. They made figurines of Venus that might have represented fertility. ","Dr. Posth and his colleagues found genetic material in the remains of Gravettians. The scientists had assumed the individuals would come from the same genetic population, but found two different groups, one in France and Spain and the other in Italy, the Czech Republic and Germany. ","They practiced the same archaeological culture, and this was a big surprise to us. Posth said something.

The Vestonice may have survived for a time in Italy when the glaciers were at their most expansive. But Dr. Posth and his colleauges didn''t find Vestonice ancestry in Europeans after the Ice Age. Instead, they found a population of hunter-gatherers that appeared to have expanded from the Balkans. The Vestonice was replaced by Italy. ","For many thousand years, southern Europe was the only place where the Villabruna could be found. After crossing the Alps, they came across the GoyetQ2 people to the north. A new population of people was formed, it had three parts, Villabruna to one part GoyetQ2. ","This new group of people, which is what Dr. has to say about this new group of people. Posth and his colleagues called the Oberkassel, expanded across much of Europe, replacing the old GoyetQ2 population. ","Dr. Posth thought another climate shift could explain the new wave. The forests of Europe were created by a pulse of strong warming about 14,000 years ago. The Oberkassel people may have been better at hunting in forests, whereas the Goyet Q2 retreated with the shrinking of the steppes. ","The Oberkassel was attacked by a group of hunter-gatherers who probably arrived from Russia. The Sidelkino was named after the descendants of the group that lived there. ","There were no great sweeps of newcomers replacing older people in Iberia. Many of the Iberians were descendants of the Fournol people, who arrived there thousands of years before the glaciers advanced. The Villabruna people moved into northern Spain, but they added their genes to the mix instead of replacing people who were there before. ","The Iberians, Oberkassel and the Sidelkino were some of the groups of hunter-gatherers who flourished across Europe when the first farmers arrived in Europe from Turkey about 8,000 years ago. Living Europeans have some of their genes. Posth and his colleagues were able to make educated guesses about the appearance of the ancient populations. ","The sidelkino people had genes that made them have dark eyes and light skin. It is harder to tell the appearance of the Oberkassel in the west compared to the Sidelkino because they have blue eyes and may have had dark skin. ","The three groups of hunter-gatherers had remained isolated from each other for 6,000 years before the farmers from Turkey arrived. The scientists discovered that the groups began mixing after the advent of agriculture. They may have moved to the margins of Europe to survive because of the spread of farmland. They were absorbed into the agricultural communities that surrounded them over time. ","A Frenchman who was not involved in the new research said that it was a landmark in the study of early humans. He said, he was really blown away. ","Dr. He said that each continent will likely have a history of hunter-gatherer migrations. Researchers were able to get a detailed picture of Europe''s history because of the 150 year''s worth of remains stored in museums there.

Birds that soar six miles into the sky, whales that weigh 200 tons and sidewinders that slither across desert dunes are just some of the amazing animal forms that evolved with their multicellular bodies. ","Questions about the first animals, such as their anatomy and how they found food, have been pondered by scientists for a long time. Scientists were able to answer some questions in the little-known group of creatures called comb jellies in a study that was published on Wednesday. Scientists found that comb jellies are part of the deepest branch on the animal family tree, despite the fact that the first animals remain a mystery. ","The debate over the origin of animals has been going on for a long time. Initially, researchers only relied on the fossil record for clues. The oldest definitive animal fossils are about 520 million years old, although some researchers claim to have found even older ones. Elizabeth Turner, a Canadian paleontologist, found 890-million-year-old fossils of sponges. ","It would make sense for sponges to be the oldest animal. They are simple creatures that do not have any muscles or nervous system. They anchor on the floor of the ocean where they work to trap bits of food and filters water through a maze of pores. ","Sponges are so simple that it can be a surprise that they''re animals at all, but that''s because their makeup reveals their kinship. They make a certain type of molecule, called the \"Collagen\", that is only made by animals. Their genetics show they are more related to animals than to other forms of life. ","During the 90s, scientists tried to draw a family tree from the collected genetic material of more animal species. In some studies, the sponges ended up on the tree''s deepest branch. Animals only evolved a nervous system after sponges branched off. ","Other scientists came to a different conclusion in the early 2000s. They found that comb jellies were the deepest branch of animals, with slim, oval creatures that grow a distinctive set of iridescent bands, that flicker in the darkness of the deep ocean. ","It meant animal evolution was more weird than they realized, so many experts were reluctant to accept that conclusion. For one thing comb jellies were not as easy to make as sponges. They have a system of nerves that control their muscles. ","The debate over comb-jelly-versus-sponge was resolved thanks to the collection of DNA from more species of ocean animals. Researchers have figured out how to sequence entire genomes, instead of looking at single genes. ","The debate was not settled by the new data. Some scientists put together a tree with sponges that were the deepest branch, while others put together a tree with comb jellies. ","A new method for using DNA to study animal evolution is the focus of a study published in the journal Nature.","Scientists looked at how certain diseases come about in different branches of the animal. A base may be switched to a different letter if there is a genetic abnormality that causes a single genetic letter to be a base. The genetics of that animal will then be passed down from one generation to the next. ","These are the markers of history that can be unreliable. There is a chance that a base may change from one letter to another, and then back to the original one millions of years later. In two unrelated lineages, the same base could switch to the same letter. There is an illusion that the two lineages are closely related as a result of that parallel evolution. ","In the new study, a group of people, including an evolutionary biologist from the University of Vienna, looked at a different kind of genetic change. Sometimes, a large piece of DNA can be accidentally moved from one part of the body to another. ","This big change is less likely to be used to deceive scientists. The chances that the same piece of DNA moves to the same location a second time are very low. It would be next to impossible for that chunk to go back to where it came from. ","Dr said it was direct evidence of something that happened. He said, \"That''s right.\" ","The genetic material of nine animals and three single celled relatives of animals were tracked by his team. The same spot was found in the genomes of sponges and other animals. There were different places where these chunks were found in the comb jellies and single-celled relatives of animals. That finding led to a decision by Dr. They thought that comb jellies split off from other animals first.

The members of the group came down in favor of comb jellies. He said that the new analysis showed that it was true. ","Dr says he doesn''t ever say the debate is over. The man said, \"Do you know what I''m saying?\" The study raises intriguing new possibilities for what the common ancestors of living animals looked like. If comb jellies are the deepest part of the animal tree, then early animals might have not been simple or spongelike because of their nervous system and muscles. They had muscles and nervous systems as well. sponges eventually gave up their nervous system. ","Dr. The combs are not living fossils and should not be thought of as such since the dawn of animals. He said something that is alive today is not the ancestors of something that is alive today. ","Researchers are looking to comb Jellyfish to see if they have the same nervous systems as other animals. Maike Kittelmann was working at Oxford Brookes University when she decided to freeze comb jelly larvae so that they could have a look at their nervous system. They were left puzzled by what they saw. ","Neural connections are typically separated from one another by tiny gaps known as synapses in the animal kingdom. Chemicals can be released to communicate across the gap. ","But when it was Dr. Kittelmann and her colleagues began to inspect the comb jellies neurons, they couldn''t find a connection between them. She said that they were curious at that point.

The comb jellies may have used some of the same building blocks to develop their weird nervous system.

","The club''s staff provide occasional meat treat to the sharks, who spent 17 years in the lake sustaining themselves on its large stock of fish. After the floods, the sharks vanished, while one was illegally fished out. ","A new study shows that the sharks are more than just a random animal on a golf course. In a paper published last month in the journal Marine and Fisheries Science, a shark scientist and lecturer in Germany said that members of a cartilaginous club proved that bull sharks are able to live indefinitely in low-salinity aquatic environments. ","There are bull sharks in the warm coastal waters around the world. The stout sharks can grow to around 13 feet in length and weigh up to 500 pounds. They have a trait that makes them able to go into freshwater habitats such as rivers, estuaries and lagoons, which is one of the few shark species that can tolerate a wide range of salinities. ","One of the reasons bull sharks are responsible for many fatal attacks on humans is the fact that this impressive adaptation often puts the sharks in close quarters with humans.","If most sharks were to enter a freshwater environment, their salt levels would decline and they would die. Bull sharks have adapted their rectal and kidneys to work together to get rid of salt in their bodies. ","Young bull sharks grow up in freshwater and brackish habitats without the threat of being eaten by larger sharks. Bull sharks head to the sea once they reach maturity, where larger prey and breeding opportunities abound. The population of the Carbrook shark didn''t grow during their time at the golf course, which further supports the species'' preference to breed in saltier environments. ","While scientists know that bull sharks have the ability to move between freshwater and saltwater environments, they don''t know if these sharks can live in freshwater for the rest of their lives.","Bull sharks can live for up to 30 years, according to research, while the Carbrook group was in the lake for 17 years. A researcher who was not involved in the study said that it suggested there was no upper limit to how long these sharks can stay in low-salinity environments.

","One group seems to have weathered the storm. The evidence that flowering plants survived mass extinction compared with other living things on Earth is presented in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters. The catastrophe may have helped plants blossom into the green things they are today. ","One of the authors of the study said it was odd to think flowering plants survived K-Pg when dinosaurs didn''t.","Scientists call flowering plants angiosperms. They were overshadowed in the early days by other groups like conifers and ferns. As mass extinction approached, they diversified rapidly.

Thompson and Ramez-Barahona are both evolutionary geneticists at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. There was a lack of fossil flowers, which are rare compared with fossilized bones, which initially hampered the pair. Orchids, one of the largest angiosperms today, barely show up in the fossil record. ","The researchers analyzed two evolutionary trees containing more than 100,000 species of angiosperms to find out the evolutionary insights that weren''t found in the fossil record. The phylogenies are large data sets that allow scientists to group related species together and understand when certain lineages broke away from each other. The evolutionary timelines of when the ancestors of the ancestors of modern angiosperm lineages emerged and when they died out are laid out in the phylogenies. ","The researchers found out something they hadn''t expected. The larger portion of flowering plants that lived near the asteroid impact crater exhibited a constant rate of extinction through time, despite the large amount of angiosperm species that died out with the dinosaurs. ","The Burke Museum''s paleobotanist, who studies fossils of the K-Pg boundary in northeastern Montana, is not involved in the new study, but she believes that it is a perfect match with the plant fossil record. The evolutionary tree of dinosaurs does not appear to have been affected by the high species-level extinction. Dinosaurs lost so many species, they lost entire lineages, which they don''t see in angiosperms, according to Dr. Thompson said it was Thompson who said it. ","While more work is needed to determine the cause of one of Earth''s most devastating extinctions, the researchers think that angiosperms'' ability to adapt played a big part in their survival. The reproductive flexibility of flowering plants is because they are pollinated by insects and wind. By the end of the Cretaceous, the grasses, sycamore and magnolia trees, as well as aquatic waterlilies, had all appeared, they may have been able to survive. ","The flowering plants took over the landscape after the climate and life recovered on Earth. The extinction allowed angiosperms to dominate according to researchers who compared the fossils from before and after the K-Pg boundary. The first rainforests were home to a lot of flowering plant diversity. ","Dr. It''s possible that the trend occurred in ancient ecosystems worldwide, said Ramrez-Barahona. He said the whole ecological composition changed before and after the K-Pg. Almost all of the plants in our environment are angiosperms. ","The impact of the dinosaurs gave rise to today''s ecosystems. Instead of giant lizards, the habitats were populated by mammals who had persisted through the mass extinction along with flowering plants and were primed for a similar explosion in diversity. ","Dr says they are starting to see plants and animals after the K-Pg boundary. Wilson Deibel has something to say.

The pieces of degraded yellow paint taken from Joan Mir''s pieces in the 70s were analyzed recently by a team of art conners and scientists. The team concluded in a study published in the journal Heritage Science that one brand of paint was most responsible for the degradation observed in the Mir pieces. ","A lot of the yellow paint is made up of cadmium and sulfur. It was first commercially available in the 1840s, and became a well-known brand among artists in the late 18th and early 19th century.

The US government recently tried to exert control over the wreck, raising questions about whether a company that has recovered more than 5,500 artifacts will be allowed to gather more. ","Mr. It''s also deeply personal thatCameron''s views are. He had a lot of disagreements with the French submariner Paul-Henri Nargeolet who died while descending to the wreck of the Titan in June of this year. Mr. Nargeolet directed underwater research for the company. ","The company owns the exclusive rights to the ship and its artifacts.","Mr. The New York Times sent an email about the questions that the Titanic''s future could be asked by, as well as what his recovery views were. This conversation was edited for clarity and length. ","The deckhouse and the forward mast are two structures that have been shown to have deteriorated during your time on the Titanic. In 2001 it was in its fallen position, but in 2005 it partially collapsed. A new image by the Magellan company shows that it is broken open and completely collapsed. ","The majority of the wreck has not seen any noticeable degradation of its structural integrity, such as the hull plates. Their steel is not a lot thicker than one and a half inches. I think the plates will be around for at least another 200 years. ","I''ve done maneuvering around the wreck, and landed on top of it, so I don''t see any significance to the damage done by visitors. In order to fly around, a small submersible has to be neutrally buoyant which means it only touches down with a few pounds of force. Any human actions are trivial compared to the relentless degradation caused by biological activity, which goes on year after year. The ship is being eaten by colonies ofbacteria. They like it when humans drop big loads of steel into the ocean, which they do a lot, especially in wars. It''s a great day for them.

All these recoveries have been talked about by someone over the last 25 years. I do not think we should take anything from the bow and stern sections. They should be remembered for their role in the tragedy. ","You were familiar with Mr. Quite well, Nargeolet. He was a legendary sub pilot and explorer, and we spent many exciting hours going over our Titanic videos and comparing notes, so did you have any disagreements with him and his company''s approach to artifact recovery? He recovered many of the artifacts, such as the crow''s nest bell, that I find so moving in the various exhibits around the world. ","I agreed with him about some of his plans to recover bow anchor, though I disagreed with him about some of his other plans. I am happy that some of the plans never came to fruition. ","You joined with Dr. in the summer of 2017, around the time that you joined the rest of the team. The collection of Titanic artifacts was not purchased by the National Maritime Museum in London and will not be moving to Belfast, where the ship was built. The public was worried that the Titanic collection would be sold to a rich private collector and it would disappear from public view, if it ever went bankrupt again. Our shared cultural heritage includes artifacts that belong to the world as part of our collective history and artifacts that help keep that history alive. They have to be seen and felt through public access. I would want to be in a position to keep the collection public and accessible if it were to be put at risk again.

","Do you think the Titan disaster will stop people from coming to see the Titanic? I think it will not affect people wanting to see the Titanic in person. Some people have a strong desire to see things with their own eyes, so the urge to go and do that is very strong for them. ","Citizen explorers should be more careful about who they dive with.

","It could arise from the ability to be aware of your own awareness, the ability to create a virtual model of the world, the ability to predict future experiences, and the ability to locate your body in space. The report argues that any one of these features should be considered an essential part of what it means to be conscious. We might be able to think about machine consciousness, if we were able to discern these traits in a machine. ","The most advanced A.I is one of the difficulties of this approach. In ways that aren''t always interpretable, systems are deep neural networks that \"learn\" how to do things on their own. For the time being, we can only glean a limited amount of information from their internal structure. The black box problem is A.I. It would be difficult to apply a full and exact rubric of consciousness to machines we use every day if we did not have a full and exact rubric of consciousness. ","The authors of the recent report note that it''s not a definitive list of what makes one conscious. They rely on the idea of Computational Functionalism, which says consciousness is reduced to pieces of information that are passed through a system, like in a pinball machine. The pinball machine could be conscious if it were made more complex, according to this view. Other ideas take our biological or physical features, social or cultural contexts, as essential pieces of consciousness, but that might mean it is not a pinball machine anymore. It is not clear how these things could be made to work in a machine. ","No existing theory seems to be enough for consciousness, even to researchers who are mostly on board with computational functionalism.","The theories must be correct for the report''s conclusions to be meaningful. Lindsay is a fictional character. She said this might be the best we can do for now. ","It seems like all of the features are lumped together in the same way that William James said it was the \"warmth\" of conscious experience. This is what the hard problem of consciousness is called. Even if it is an A.I. Robert Long was one of the philosophers at the Center for A.I and he asked if the system still lacked the thing that made it feel like something. Safety who led work on the report, he said, \"that feeling is kind of a thing that happens whenever you try to scientifically explain, or reduce to physical processes, some high-level concept.\" Our ability to explain what is happening is lagging behind machine learning. Blake Lemoine, an engineer at the company, argued that LaMDA was conscious and further integration of generative A.I. The topic could become more heated as a result of being into our lives. Dr. Long argues that we have to start making some claims about what is conscious and complains about the way we have gone about it, conflating subjective experience with general intelligence or rationality. He said that this was an issue that they faced right now and over the next few years. ","Megan Peters, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine and an author of the report, stated, \"whether there''s somebody in there or not makes a big difference on how we treat it.\" This can be similar to a house activity, such as shooting empirical arrows from moving platforms towards shape-shifting targets, with bows that sometimes turn out to be spaghetti. Sometimes we get hit, but it''s not every day that we get a hit. The author of \" Metazoa\" said in his book that humans have a robust but categorically different type of subjective experience than the cephalopods. 40 million neurons in each arm is what the occidentals have. We rely on a number of observations, inferences, and experiments, both organized and not, to solve this problem of other minds. We talk, touch, play, hypothesize, control, X-ray and dissection, but, ultimately, we still do not know what makes us conscious. We just know that we are, and that''s all we know. "]');

There is a hard squash and a diamond pink squash. ","The Argyle mine in Western Australia was one of the world''s most productive diamond deposits, and more than 90 percent of the pink stones ever found came from there. Many of Argyle''s diamonds are dark in color. A couple would appear in the rarer and more valuable pink out of every thousand gems. ","Now Dr. The estimates for when and how the gems arrived on the Earth''s surface were given by Olierook and his colleagues. In a study published in the journal Nature Communications, they report that the blushing and brown stones were pushed through the continental edges during the demise of Nuna, one of Earth''s earliest supercontinents. The work suggests that ancient continental junctures may be hiding more of these colorful gems. ","The diamonds that would emerge at Argyle formed close to the continental roots. As landmasses smashed together to form Nuna, collision near Australia''s northwestern edge provided the pressure needed to color the once-colorless gems. ","Argyle''s diamond studded volcanic rocks erupted roughly 1.2 billion years ago, according to Robert Pidgeon, the professor who led the team that found it in the late 1980s. There were few obvious catalysts for eruptions that would bring Argyle''s diamonds up from the deep. ","Australia was at that point floating happily through the ocean, according to Dr. Olierook said it was true. ","But Dr. Pidgeon had been questioning his own findings for a long time. The eruption that produced Argyle''s diamond haul blasted through an ancient lake, which altered the rocks, which may affect the accuracy of the dating estimate. He mentioned that he was worried about it during a hallway conversation with another author who had assembled a team to take a closer look. ","The researchers were able to produce a new estimate of the age of Argyle rocks with the use of a laser beam that was less than a hair''s width. The eruption occurred about 100 million years before Dr., according to their analysis. Pidgeon had an estimate. ","The new date is related to when Nuna began to splinter, which is when earlier continents had collided. Olierook is a man who lives and works in a city. Olierook is not a person who lives and works in a city. Near the edge of what is now northwestern Australia, the thinness may have helped diamond- studded magma shoot to the surface. ","The link between diamond deposits and continental rifting is not a new idea, but the details are debated. A recent study shows that if the supercontinent is to break, there could be currents in the earth''s mantle that send diamond-rich eruptions through its crust. ","These currents are likely to travel inland over the course of time, which could help explain why most diamond-rich eruptions blast through thick continental interiors. The Argyle diamonds, which erupted near the continental edge, may be an early phase of this process before the eruptions marched inland. ","The new study is an important step to understand how the perfect storm of conditions helped create Argyle''s colorful gems, said Thomas Gernon, a geology professor at the University of Southampton in England who has studied how diamonds are shaped by supercontinent splits.","Some questions have not been answered yet. Steve Shirey was not part of the study team, but he said that this was the last part of the story. He wonders why so much carbon had been collected in the first place, and why it was used to create Argyle''s abundance of diamonds. ","Argyle''s new age range could be further narrowed according to DavidPhillips, a geochemist at the University of Melbourne. The conclusions of the study might be correct, but in my opinion, this is still an open question.

The placozoans are one of the simplest of the major animal lineages. ","A team of researchers have found compelling proof of neuron-like cells in placozoans. placozoans are thought to be the source of the nervous systems in more complex animals, including humans. The journal Cell published the work on Tuesday. ","You may think that placozoans are a bunch of apes when you look under a microscope. The organisms are not animals. The tree of life has more in common with bilaterians, which include coral and sea anemones, than with poriferans, which include coral and sea anemones. The placozoans'' nervous system is governed by nerve cells and was thought to be different than the other animal''s. ","According to a researcher at the center for Genomic Regulation, no one would have thought that the organisms were similar to the cells in the brain.","The Placozoan bodies are only three cell layers thick. It is enough to glide around, absorb and digest food, and respond to their environment. Instead of being controlled by neurons, some of these behaviors can be regulated by peptidergic cells. ","Dr says that the activity of the cells is similar to more complex nervous systems in humans. The possibility that these cells and their connections might represent the nervous system of an ancient animal ancestor was intriguing to Grau-Bové and his colleagues. ","The research team began their research by analyzing the expression of genes in over 60,000 individual cells across four placozoan species. The 14 types of peptidergic cells that placozoans have are used to build neuron in bilaterians and cnidarians. They found that the cells weren''t true neuron because of their inability to receive messages and lack of electrical activity. ","There are potential interactions in placozoans between the peptidergic cells and other cells on the map created by the researchers. Specific pairs of neuropeptides and receptors were identified as well as a complex signaling network. The chemical brain hypothesis postulates that the earliest nervous systems evolved as networks of cells connected with chemical signals that would diffuse across an animal. ","The scientists compared the functions of cells in other animal species with the functions of cells in peptidergic cells. They found major similarities between the way genes are used in placozoan peptidesrgic cells and the way they work in cnidarian and bilaterian animals. Early nervous systems were similar to what we see in placozoans today and have evolved for hundreds of millions of years into complex cells that send electrical signals. ","Jacob Musser, a molecular evolutionary biologists at Yale University, who was not involved in the study, said that the genetic similarity of the peptidergic cells to the neurons was very striking. It suggests that before the advent of a nervous system, some of the neuronal machinery was being packaged into cells and used for some form of communication. He was looking forward to seeing how similar approaches could be used to investigate the nervous system evolution in more ancient animals like ctenophores. Their nervous systems are not clear where they are in evolution. ","placozoans are the best model of early animal nervous system, according to Michael Paulin, a computational Evolutionary neuroscientist at the University of Otago in New Zealand who was not involved in the research. He said it was possible that the ancestors of animals were placozoans, and that studying them could help us understand what is happening in our brains.

Prior to that, the oldest examples of this craft were located on platforms on the edge of a British lake. ","Annemieke Milks, an archaeologist who was not involved in the new study, told Nature that ancient wood products are very rare due to the fact that the organic material typically degrades over thousands of years. She said that it almost never preserves. ","There is no clear answer on what early humans were building in Africa. The doctor by the name of Dr. Milks said that the discovery suggested that they used wood for more ambitious designs, such as platforms or walkways, rather than just for spears or digging sticks. ","She said that most early human groups would have used wood. A group of international scientists discovered the logs near an enormous waterfall in Africa, known as the Kalambo Falls. The Kalambo River begins its journey to Lake Tanganyika at an altitude of 770 feet. ","The site has a checkered history for archaeologists. In the 1950s a British archaeologist found stone tools, as well as pieces of wood that he proposed had been digging sticks and spears in the area near the falls. Some of the pieces looked like they had been burned, and they were some of the oldest evidence of people making fires. ","Much of the charisma of Dr was lost by the early 2000s. Clark''s discovery had been gone for a while. He didn''t get a firm fix for the age of the wood. The only method of determining age that was reliable at the time was radiocarbon dating, which can only be used on objects less than 50,000 years old. The wood pieces at Kalambo Falls proved to be more older than the ones in the picture. People had made the wood objects, but they weren''t sure if they actually made them. There is a doctor named Dr. Clark said that they might have been branches that had fallen into the river and were then reshaped by sand grains in the water near the falls. ","Lawrence Barham and his colleagues were in 2006 at the Kalambo Falls. Researchers had developed a new way to determine the age of archaeological sites, using what is known as geological clock effect, that is, the ability of quartz grains to act like geological clocks. As the atoms break in the ground, they release the energy that gets trapped inside. Scientists can later measure the amount of energy stored in the grains when they are in their labs.

Duller had planned to use a dating technique that was based on grains of strontium rather than strontium. ","When they arrived at the doctor''s office. They found that Clark''s old site had vanished. The river shifted 13 years after their last trip. There was only a reed-filled marsh left. ","Fortunately, that''s what Dr. was able to do. The Plan B was prepared by Barham. He used a map on the internet to find a strip of beach near the river. They were there when they got there. Barham could see a stick out of the sand. He discovered a sharp tip in the water that fit on one end of the stick. The fragments might have washed away if he hadn''t come a year later. Dr said it was just a moment of luck. Barham said something. ","Stone tools and wood shaped into wedges and V''s were found by the researchers in the same area.","Dr. Duller was able to determine the age of the artifacts by using the grains of strontium. He looked at the ages of the objects and found that they were from three different ages: 487,000 years ago, 390,000 years and 324,000 years. It could be that people lived by the river throughout that time or returned to it over thousands of generations. ","The most spectacular discovery of the year was made by the researchers at the end of the field season. The log of a small African tree known as Zeyher''s bush willow was found in the oldest layer of sand. The researchers noticed a large notch near the end of the log. They discovered that part of the log was resting on a bigger tree trunk when they dug further down. ","The researchers took high-resolution photographs as they exposed the wood. The chop marks on the log and the trunk are thought to have been worked on by people with axes and scraper tools. Dr. said that this was deliberate. The man said Barham. It is intentional. Milks said taking photographs of the wooden objects as soon as they were found was crucial for understanding how they were made. The wood was able to survive for hundreds of thousands of years, largely due to the waterlogged sand. It can lose vital clues in a matter of minutes if ancient wood is exposed to the air again. It can shrink, warp and wreak havoc on its surroundings, according to Dr. There were milks said. ","Dr. Barham and his colleagues collaborated with a traditional Zambian woodworker to get a better understanding of their findings. They think people cut down live trees with stone axes. The two pieces of wood needed to be worked together to make a larger structure. ","Dr. Barham speculated that the log and trunk were part of a structure built over the marshy land along the Kalambo River. He said keeping firewood dry is one way to keep your feet dry.

He referred to the Punan Batu and other coastal groups in an email as \"''fake'' Punan.\" Based on historical accounts and ethnographies, he remains convinced that the Punan Batu and other coastal groups were not native to the island, but slaves brought from eastern Indonesia several centuries ","A new study that looks at the DNA of the Punan Batu is going to eliminate doubts of all but the most hardened critics. They are likely to have been isolated for more than 20 generations due to limited diversity in the genes of the Punan Batu. Dr. Sellato''s contention that the Punan Batu are the descendants of imported slaves does not fit with the results. ","The new findings have the potential to end a century-old debate about when the Punan first arrived in Borneo, and how they became hunter-gatherers in the first place. The Punan Batu deserve a hand in managing their forest, which is threatened by encroaching palm oil plantations and commercial forestry operations, because of the research. ","Dr. said, what they want is what they desperately want. Borneo is the third-largest island in the world and is covered by rugged mountains, rainforests and swamps. The country has a population of 21 million which is divided into three countries: Malaysia and Brunei to the north, and Indonesia to the south. ","Waves of migration have shaped the island''s population. Stone Age hunter-gatherers used the cave in the north to get to mainland Southeast Asia when a land bridge linked the island to mainland Southeast Asia tens of thousands of years ago. The Dayak, contemporary Indigenous groups, arrived by sea from Taiwan 4,000 to 6,000 years ago and brought domesticated rice with them. ","Where the Punan came from is not known. Dark skin, a short stature and curly hair are some of the physical features shared by scattered groups of hunter-gatherers in other parts of Southeast Asia. The first wave of modern humans left Africa more than 60,000 years ago and made their way east, where they encountered and sometimes mixed with extinct hominins. ","The Punan, the hunter-gatherers that early explorers encountered on Borneo, looked a lot like the Dayaks. The nomadic Punan Batu had trade relationships with many of the settled communities. ","The northeast coast was under the control of a Muslim kingdom by the mid-1700s. After the Sultan failed to deliver a wife, the Punan Batu appeased him with the nest of swiftlet birds from the forest, which they were exported to China, where they were prized for bird''s nest soup. ","The Punan Batu was hired by the Sultan to perform risky work, that included collecting the nest from the caves, honey from the treetops, and rattan and fragrant agar wood. They received tobacco, rice and metal tools from the Sultan. They were still isolated even though they weren''t solely reliant on wild food. In 1903, a Dutch resident said they were at the lowest level of development, and thirty years later, another person said they were a backward group, which almost does not mix with other Punan. One of his relatives, Prince Har, treated the Punan Batu almost like his slaves during the 1980s, according to a voluble man in his late 60s who is a descendant of the Sultanate. The idea of a Punan identity has been questioned for a long time, because Har was very strict to the Punan, telling them to stay in the forest. During the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1945, anthropologists defended natural selection and argued that the Punan weren''t full-time hunter-gatherers. The researchers noted that Punan groups were more related to neighboring Dayak communities than to other Punan groups and that they spoke a different language than other Punan groups.

There is a small city in the state of Michigan, the name is \"Lansing.\" ","Bo''odon was the next singer up, he was a bare chested man in his 60s. He said he was a true friend of Dr. The capital of Michigan, the city ofLansing. I wondered when this would bear fruit. May our relationship bring about the return of our lands to us, as song languages represent a fluid form of creative expression. The vocabulary used by different Punan Batu singers was only 70 percent overlap, which is unlike a typical spoken language, where different speakers will identify the same objects and concepts using the same words more than 95 percent of the time. The people ofLansing have gathered. ","Dr. There may have been unknown words in the songs, which might have come from Borneo''s Stone Age hunter-gatherers, who we know from bones and cave paintings. Determining if the Punan Batu are related to the cave dwellers or not would require a genetic analysis. ","Dr. The ethics board of Kusuma''s institution approved the collection of blood from 12 individuals. He told them how their blood would be analyzed, and obtained their consent, because most of the Punan Batu can''t read or write. ","He has now analyzed all the samples, including those from the Punan and Dayak in Borneo, as well as samples from the Indigenous groups in Sumatra and West Papua. The Punan Batu are very close to the Punan Tubu and Punan Aput found on other rivers, according to the study. ","Dr used ancient remains of a female hunter-gatherer from an island in the Taiwan Strait as a comparison for the Punan''s genes. The Punan broke away from the mainland around 7,000 years ago, according to Kusuma. It''s not possible that they''re Dayak farmers who had recently reverted to a hunting and gathering lifestyle. ","The journal Cell Reports accepted the study for publication. Kusuma said it was not a question of if, it was a question of when. ","The results show that the settlement of Southeast Asia was accomplished through multiple waves of migration, said Hoh Boon-Peng, a geneticist at the International Medical University in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He said that more fossil DNA is needed to show the split between the Punan and the Dayak. ","Dr. The French National Centre for Scientific Research has long maintained that the Punan weren''t farmers gone bush, but Sellato remained skeptical of the significance of the Punan Batu to that century-old debate. He admitted he didn''t have the expertise to evaluate the new genetic data but insisted that any sensible, self-respecting Punan would disappear into the far hinterland rather than become a slave. The model that had succeeded withinBali was scientific research becoming the pillar that supported cultural preservation. ","Since 1980, more than 30% of Borneo''s forests have been lost. The land of the Punan Batu has not received formal protection despite it being recognized as a traditional user of the forest. There are three companies that have rights to harvest trees there, but no one has acted on them. ","It''s more troubling to Dr. One of the palm oil plantations has been encroaching from the north, according to satellite maps. ","Family groups usually spend eight to nine days at one camp before moving several miles to the next one, according to theGPS belts that the researchers left with the Punan. Their territory is three times the size of Manhattan. ","The Nature Conservancy is working with the Leakey Foundation to have the craggy landscape designated a park to prevent the mining of the limestone mountains for cement. Indonesia is building a new capital, Nusantara, 250 miles to the south. ","It is not clear how long the Punan Batu lifestyle will last. In the middle of the forest, a man in his 20s who has become a skilled chain sawr gave us a tour of his one-room home. Fresh sawdust was still on the floor, as it was elevated on stilts. The vegetation surrounding was burned to make way for planting sweet potatoes and sugar cane. ","Dr. Dr. Lansing and Lansing''s brother, who is also a doctor. Kusuma said he was surprised at the development that had taken place more abruptly than he had thought. The only other houses built this far upriver were used as temporary shelters for trade, and they knew of a man named Punan who had left the forest for the city. ","He barely realized the significance of the framed house and farm, which marked a shift from the caves and bamboo lean-tos he had grown up sleeping in. He shrugged and said it was nice. ","It has been said that a life lived on foot can be unpleasant for the Punan when it comes to the rites of passage. He had to think about his children and their future, but he would continue to hunt and collect honey. A permanent home is where it''s at right now. ","Sarah Diamond is the producer of the audio."]');

Dr, stay up-to-date on Covid shots. If you become infected and qualify, Gronvall said you should get Paxlovid.

The man said that he was the Garcia-Romeu. ","Seven people had cardiovascular issues, including faster heartbeats. The doctor said that according to Dr. According to Paul Summergrad, who was not involved in the research but who is a professor of psychiatry at the school, there could be a case for older patients or people with known heart problems being evaluated before being treated with MDMA. ","The F.D.A and MAPS have worked closely in the past. To figure out the study method and the number of participants needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the new treatment. ","Most participants were able to guess if they had received a placebo or MDMA. This is a normal challenge across Psychiatry research and is something that the authors acknowledge and did everything possible to mitigate. Steven Zalcman, the chief of the adult pathophysiology andbiological interventions development branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, was not involved in the research. ","The follow-up study is looking at the long term durability of the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy. Most participants who received the drug in the Phase 2 studies had the benefits for at least 12 months. ","The F.D.A will get a new drug application from MAPS. Permission is sought for MDMA-assisted therapy. Within a year, the agency could make a decision on pending drug reviews. ","The study''s results did not meet the criteria of the F.D.A., according to some outside experts.","The benefits of the active group were not as great as those of the placebo group. Allen is a professor at Duke University. MDMA treatment would result in a massive misallocation of already very scarce resources, because it would add huge costs to the treatment system, while providing only a small, specific benefit. The director of a therapy center who wasn''t involved in the study criticized this \"scarcity mind-set,\" saying that the focus for health care professionals should be on increasing treatment options. The Drug Enforcement Agency would have to give a less serious ranking for the drug if it received federal approval for MDMA-assisted therapy. They came from states. ","Therapist training is something that could be a problem. The company oversees its own therapist education program as well as working with universities and other partners to increase training. ","There are specific standards and requirements for the F.D.A. There are still questions about what the agency would suggest for the instructions of MDMA-assisted therapy, as well as what prescribers would want, said Amy Emerson, the chief executive of MAPS PBC. ","She said there is not a lot of precedent when it comes to drug-assisted therapy.","The company hasn''t yet set a price for the drug. It won''t be able to determine how much the therapy component will cost. ","It is trying to get coverage from insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare. \"Emerson\", said the person. The group is working on patient access programs for those who can''t afford to pay out of pocket, as well as helping those who don''t have coverage at all.

He was testifying as an expert for the agency, with his hair white and his overview of the ingredient that had been around for 50 years. ","His advocacy culminated in the advisory panel''s unanimous vote on Tuesday when it concluded that the common ingredient in cold and flu remedies is not effective.","After learning that phenylephrine, a common over-the-counter drug used for congestion, was listed in hundreds of other over-the-counter drugs, consumers threw open their medicine cabinets. Experts say that the ingredient still works in a nasal spray, but not when taken in pill or liquid form. ","Experts say there''s no need to throw away the products with other ingredients that do work because the drug is safe.","There won''t be any change immediately. F.D.A is a abbreviation for Faculties d''Assortements d''Assortements de Faculties d''Assortements. Drug makers probably won''t face a decision to pull store shelves of many consumer staple products, because officials will review the panel''s decision, solicit public comments, and give them some time to adjust or swap out ingredients. There are delays that could occur if the companies decide to contest the actions in court. Some experts, notably Dr. Gottlieb was a former F.D.A. commissioner, have maintained for a long period of time that phenylephrine does work. Proponents of the drug may try to prevent an action that wipes out the scurvy altogether. ","But how phenylephrine survived despite being studied for decades, and despite the fact that there was a law signed by Kennedy that banned the production of meth, is not easy to understand.","Similar to other federal agencies, the F.D.A. At times it''s hard to move because of antiquated rules and a morass of regulatory procedures. ","Dr said that the regulation of over- the-counter medications was broken for a long time. Joshua Sharfstein was an agency official and the vice dean of the public health school at the Bronx school of public health. He said the latest moves show that the agency is only now getting its handcuffs off. The Kennedy era brought in a new law that required the F.D.A. It is necessary to evaluate a drug''s effectiveness in addition to the existing safety standards. ","1976 was when the F.D.A became a reality. phenylephrine was one of the drugs reviewed as over-the-counter cold medicines. ","The long delays for the approval of the decongestant attracted the attention of Dr, and they were still in place by the early 1990s. The University of Florida has a group of pharmacy professors. ","They would be the one constant in the last 30 years of phenylephrine''s history because of putting pressure on the F.D.A. To do something to make a difference. ","Dr. The first critique of the drug was published in 1993 and noted that the agency had oversight of two more popular decongestants that were not effective, and a third that wasn''t: phenylephrine. Blood vessels were supposed to be closed and nose was supposed to be cleared with the medication. He wrote in a medical journal that it was destroyed in the stomach. Most of the medication didn''t make it to the bloodstream, but it did make it to the nose. ","The abuse of the drug and illegal methamphetamine labs in rural areas on the west coast exploded in the 2000s, in what would seem to be an unrelated problem.","Pseudoephedrine was the most common decongestant on the market at the time and could be found at any drugstore.","It was one of only two decongestants that could be used for congestion relief and one that was pulled from the market in 2000 after studies linked it to strokes.","Consumers had to show identification and sign a ledger in order to purchase pseudoephedrine from behind the counter or a locked cabinet under new state and federal laws that were enacted in the wake of the meth crisis.","The last option permitted by the F.D.A. was  phenylephrine, because companies with medicines containing meth were concerned about losing sales.","Dr. He was upset to see the ingredient in the medicine in the pharmacy, knowing that patients were complaining that the replacement did not help them at all. ","He worked with a colleague. They plumbed the data used in the 1970s for the drug''s initial approval. ","Dr. The F.D.A was the subject of memos unearthed by Hatton. It was not peer-reviewed from the 1960s and 1970s. The data was run in modern analysis software, and it was found that the drug was not better than a placebo. ","As their research went on, they were led by Dr. He was once a visiting scientist at the F.D.A. He said that he was not breaking through. He went to the office of the U.S. Henry Waxman, a crusading California lawmaker, was in need of help. ","Mr. Waxman said the professors had findings that he wanted the agency to act on. F.D.A. is a acronym for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He wrote in a letter in 2006 that Americans have a duty to be informed so that they don''t waste their hard-earned money on medicines that don''t work. ","The name of the F.D.A. is F.D.A. The findings of its 1976 decision were restated that same year. The letter told consumers they had the option of not buying the product if they didn''t get relief from phenylephrine. The letter said that hendeles was free to ask for help from the agency. ","And he did that, that''s what he did. Dr. A study of the use of the drug in children was requested by Hendeles. A public F.D.A has been created as a result of that. The advisory hearing was held in 2007. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the business trade group that represents the makers of over-the-counter medicine, maintained that the drug worked. ","The person is a doctor by the name of Dr. The man remembers what he considered show-stopper testimony. The makers of Claritin-D had studied their rival and found it had no effect, as they had restricted pseuodoephedrine. A letter written by a man describes the company''s move to keep the powerful formula for Claritin-D. Waxman said something about what he had noted. ","The advisory committee voted 11 to 1 that the evidence supports the suggestion that phenylephrine may be effective, and called for more research.","Eight years went by.","Then Dr. The study that came out of the acquisition of Schering Plough by Merck was pounced upon by Hendeles and colleagues. The company examined the drug at four times the authorized dose, and again found that it didn''t relieve symptoms. A study on a slow-release formula was funded by the company. ","There was a stubbornness to the head complaint, congestion, that did not budge.","The agency banned the sale of Claritin-D, which is still containing pseudoephedrine, after the Florida pharmacy petitioned them for a ban. Many former agency officials said that their efforts were stymied by the over-the-counter division, which had 31 staff members at the end of the year. ","Dr said the staff had to follow an arcane process that handcuffed the agency and didn''t provide enough resources to clear a waiting list. Peter Lurie worked at the agency as an associate commissioner. ","The Florida team has had to deal with a lot of obstacles throughout the years.","Dr wrote on X after this week''s vote. Gottlieb, who became the agency''s commissioner in early 2019, said that the panel''s decision was a shame. There are no good, cheap, accessible options for consumers to get incremental relief, according to an interview on Friday. Gottlieb thought there was more study to be done on the ingredient. He thinks it''s premature to say that it doesn''t work. ","The F.D.A. changed its procedures for over-the-counter drugs so that they would be more in line with those in its prescription drug division, which renewed interest in the decongestant.","It was soon after the F.D.A. The team took up longstanding issues with the decongestant, producing an 89-page review of phenylephrine that the advisory panel combed as the basis for its decision. The report from the agency confirmed the findings of Dr. The drug''s initial acceptance was noted by Hendeles and his colleagues, as well as bias in some of the 1970s data that led to the drug''s initial acceptance. \"Hendelas said it,\" the man said. ","He was testifying before the panel earlier this week. phenylephrine was found to be a dud in 1971 when a study used modified scuba masks to measure the amount of congestion in the nose. ","The American College of Clinical Pharmacy, Public Citizen, and National Center for Health Research urged the panel to get rid of the ingredient. The association argued that the effect of the ingredient was not affected by low levels in the blood. The Kenvue spinoff said it sells cold products without phenylephrine, which is a small part of its business. ","Agency advisers cast a 16-to-1 vote. Hendeles was very happy. He said the vote was exciting and exhilarating. ","The lawyers representing people who bought cold and flu remedies containing phenylephrine say the drug companies knew it was useless, and therefore are going to file lawsuits against them.","The products are still on the shelves. Dr said they felt vindicated for the work they''ve done for a long time. There is a statement from the person who said it, and that is the person who said it, and that is the one who said it, and that is the one who said it, and that is the person who said it, and that is the person who said it, and that It is not over.

But she was able to prevail. ","Ms. Govatos is a retired executive at nonprofits in Delaware who has been grateful for the extra years. She said that she felt fortunate. She has been able to take long term learning courses, work in her garden and visit her friends in London and Cape Cod. She spends time with her two grandsons, but she knows that the cancer may return and that she doesn''t want to endure the pain and disability of further attempts to eradicate it. ","I am not interested in being treated to death. She told her oncologist that she wanted a good quality of life. When her months dwindle, she wants medical aid in dying. After a number of consultations, a doctor would prescribe a lethal dose of a medication to the patient, and then she would take it on her own. ","Delaware''s aid in dying law remains illegal despite a number of attempts to pass a bill that would allow it. It''s legal in New Jersey, which is a half-hour drive from Ms. Govatos is at his home. ","New Jersey restricts aid for dying to residents of it''s own state. Ms. Govatos became one of four people who were going to take New Jersey officials to federal court. ","New Jersey''s residency requirement violates the Constitution''s privileges and immunities clause and its equal protection clause, according to a lawsuit filed last month.","The New York firm that brought the suit with the advocacy group Compassion and Choices stated that the statute prohibits New Jersey physicians from giving equal care to non-New Jersey residents.","He said that there is no justification for such discrimination. The suit claims that the ban on New Jersey doctors helping out-of-state patients get aid-in-dying care restricts interstate commerce. ","The office of the New Jersey Attorney General did not respond to a request for comment.","Ms said that she would like to not die in pain and fear. Govatos said that''s what he said. Many of the pain medications she uses can cause her to pass out, hallucinate and vomit when she is inHospice can cause some pain medications to cause her to pass out, hallucinate and vomit. ","She said to be able to legally end her life was a question of mercy and kindness.","This route has been pursued before by Compassion & Choices in its effort to broaden access to aid in dying. The suits were first filed in Oregon in 2021, and then in Vermont last year. The legislatures of Vermont and Oregon repealed residency requirements in May and July of this year, after both states agreed to settle. ","The hope is that New Jersey will follow suit. We hope that we don''t have to go before a judge. Mr stated that they preferred to negotiate an equitable resolution. He said, \"Bassett said.\" That is what is important for our patients. They have little time to try to convince a state legislature that this is a good idea. End-of-life laws and court cases are tracked by Paul, Minn. ","If residency requirements are dropped in New Jersey, it will have a larger impact than if they are dropped in Oregon or Vermont. The sheer population density of New Jersey, which is almost 20 million people, means that medical aid in dying would be more available to a lot of people and more quickly than would be the case if it were not for legislation. ","It is easier to travel to Newark from Burlington, Vermont, thanks to a major airport and direct flights. Pope pointed out something. ","Aid in dying is legal in many states, but they have relaxed their laws after a study showed that a third of California patients who asked a doctor to help them end their lives died before the process was completed or they became too sick to continue it.","New Jersey still has a series of steps in place that were codified in 1994 by Oregon. That means at least two verbal requests to the doctor at the same time, a written request with 2 witnesses, and a consultation with a second physician, all of which need to be confirmed that the patient is eligible. After the written request is received, there is a waiting time of 48 hours for a prescription to be written. ","Without having to establish residency, it will not be a walk in the park. The Pope said something to a group of people. Finding a doctor willing to prescribe can take time, as does using one of the state’s few compounding pharmacies, which combine the necessary drugs and fill the prescription. ","Both Mr and an official would not check to see if the patients travel home with the medication. They were Bassett and Mr. The Pope suggested that New Jersey be the location for the lethal dose to avoid the possibility of family members facing prosecution in their home states for assisting in a suicide. ","The process for dying patients to become residents will be simpler if they aren''t required to sign leases and obtain government IDs. Dr said that not everyone has the will or the financial means to establish residency. The doctor is one of the doctors that is part of the lawsuit and is based in southern New Jersey. The residency requirements in New York and Minnesota don''t include very disabled people, that''s why the bills recently introduced in Minnesota and New York don''t include residency requirements at all. Pope said that they are likely to be challenged in court. ","He said that he thought the writing was on the wall. I think that all the residency requirements will go in all the states where aid in dying is legal. The legality of Montana depends on a court decision, not legislation, so there are 10 and the District of Columbia. ","State records show that few patients actually use lethal drugs in the end despite the often heated debate over aid-in-dying laws. The state reported that 431 people got prescriptions last year and more than 300 of them died from using them. ","Last year in New Jersey, less than 100 patients used aid in dying. Roughly one third of those who receive prescriptions never use them, and they''re reassured by the prospect of a quick exit. ","John Burzichelli, who helped steer New Jersey''s death tourism statute through the legislature and now favors allowing eligible outside patients to participate, said that death tourism fears have not materialized, despite the fact that out of state patients have an onrush of out-of state patients.","He said that he did not expect people to use the law at the tollbooths.","New Jersey won''t allow out-of-staters to legally end their lives if she gets cancer again. Govatos is thinking about going to Vermont. Driving over the Delaware Memorial Bridge is what she envisions for the farewell party, with poetry, music, and good wine and lovely food, for a few friends and family members. She said it would be an incredible gift if she could go to New Jersey. "]');

Ms said that seeing strangers embrace her culture with so much enthusiasm is something she''ll remember for the rest of her life. The man is a manager at the finance firm. She said they were full of joy and happiness when she met them. Bollywood films have frequently depicted Indian weddings full of dance sequence, such as the three-and-a half-hour long feature centered around a royal marriage. The second season of the Amazon Prime drama series, \"Made in Heaven,\" follows a wedding planning company in Delhi, and it has a plotline where one of the characters is looking to make money by inviting tourists to the weddings.

","Parul Bhandari, a sociologist, said that the idea of an Indian wedding without spending years of emotions in a friendship is the product of a two-way street of the fetishization of Indian weddings and wedding tourism.","Dr. Wedding tourism is part of the larger trend of selling experiences, like travelers going to Japan to attend a tea ceremony. ","Indian weddings can take place over three days, though some go longer, and so join my wedding will get you to attend just one day for $150 or two or more days for $250. The founder of Join My Wedding said the site takes a commission, but that the majority of the fee is kept by the couple. ","Ms., is there any chance that you''ll be able to tell me what I''m talking about? Join My Wedding was founded by Parkanyi, a Hungarian-Australian, based in Lier, Norway. She had never been to an Indian wedding before starting the business, but she said that Bollywood was what drew her attention to them. She said that it was like a music festival. ","Last month, the site had over 1,200 weddings registered that a traveler could choose from, and over 400 bookings have been made through it in total, according to Ms. Parkanyi. Access to weddings in India is the current focus of the business. Parkanyi wants to expand to other countries. ","She said that every cultural element is present at a wedding. Ms said that if she had one day in any country in the world, she would want to go to a wedding. Parkanyi said something. The ceremony guide is responsible for explaining the ceremonies and festivities to the tourists, as well as answering questions on what to wear and where to stay, and is usually a close friend or family member of the bride and groom.

We decided to get married because we fell in love with each other.

Tandon, a manager at an engineering firm, talks about how they noticed similarities between the ceremonies they performed at home and some of the Indian rituals that they had seen in other parts of the world.

","Mr. He said that he participated in Join My Wedding because he thought it would be unique to have a foreigner at his wedding. He said that he wanted to show off his pride in being Indian. Tourists are always appreciated in our country. I thought that I should sign up for the wedding for some Indian couples so that they could enjoy the great atmosphere and experience of an Indian wedding. The appeal of having a foreign attendee at a wedding, according to Bhandari, is that they might be seen as elevated status in the eyes of onlookers. A white person going to a wedding of a non-Indian is seen as a status symbol. Emily Lord works for the Department of Veterans Affairs in South Dakota and says that it shows a sort of cosmopolitanism and success. There was a wedding earlier this year. When she learned about Join My Wedding she decided to add it to her itinerary, since she already had a trip to India planned. I felt like a princess. I stayed in this room and it was absolutely gorgeous. The Lord said something like \"I said something\" or something along those lines. When asked if she was worried that another culture would be exploited, Ms said, \"I got to wear all these beautiful clothes.\" She said that she was more worried about being a minority in a new country than she was about being a majority. Ms said that she was not the only white person in the room. \"Lord said it,\" he said. It happened to me a couple of times, but the other people would always laugh at me and say, ''No, you can''t dip that in there.'' The Lord said something. It felt like if someone put something on a hot dog that it would make them sick. Sarah McDonald, a 30-year-old geologist in Halifax, Nova Scotia, decided to buy a ticket for a wedding during her backpacking trip in India with a friend. Ms. McDonald recalled that they were called out for not wearing a sari at a ceremony and that they were told to do so. She said there was no way they would be able to get tailored, beautiful gowns for the wedding because they were backpacking. We tried to buy saris, but they wouldn''t fit in our rooms so we couldn''t make it work. It is a bit complicated. We wore flowing skirts and pants that had some decorative Indian-style adornments and we wore them while we were out and about. McDonald did not feel any concern about coming into a sacred event as an outsider. She said that there were a lot of eyes on them and that they definitely stood out. Dr stated that he was not anxious about breaking any customs or disrespecting any religious rituals, while some travelers referred to traditional clothing as \"costumes\" and religious ceremonies as \"Bollywood performances.\" Race and ethnic identities can give someone a sense of superiority and confidence, according to a University of Chicago professor. There is a certain entitlement here, she said.

","These stories can take a life of their own in a very short period of time. The internet began tracking his location and calling West elm to demand that he be fired. The women who accused him were threatening to kill them, so they began to get death threats of their own. ","Josh admitted that he stole a pair of shoes. He shouldn''t be able to get away with that. Jessica said that the man took some shoes but he didn''t commit a murder. ","Dougé told Jessica that she had received a shocking amount of online hatred, and that she was being recognized constantly, even though she had recently got her Tabis back.","There isn''t an easy solution to this pattern. The dark side of social media platforms is that of vigilantism and harassment, even though they sometimes have the power to deliver justice.

Mr began to cry. His mother held him as he stepped out for the finale. The designers received a standing ovation from the audience. ","After weeks of speculation, Chioma Nnadi was confirmed as the successor to Edward Enninful at British Vogue. The editor in chief was Enninful. Ms. When Nnadi takes up the role of head of editorial content next month, she''ll be the first black woman to lead a fashion title. She''s an avid fan of Anna Wintour and is the editor of the American Vogue website. Ms will be returning to her previous home, as her new job will be a home away from home. Nnadi was born in London. ","There is a person named Matty Bovan who knows how to turn heads. He had his guests come backstage for dinner while his models were getting ready, and that was the set of the week. There was a frenzy of hair and make-up touches-ups and guests ate lobster pot pie while drinking Tanqueray cocktails in the crypt of St. The model who was wearing Mr, was at theMartin-in-the-Fields church. The fabrics and forms were mixed by Bovan. ","The founder of Labrum is Foday Dumbuya. Mr. Dumbuya won the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design this year, and he uses the prize money to tell stories about African art, fashion and history. He had his eyes on the Nomoli figurines of Sierra Leone and the other countries involved in the war in that part of the world. They were printed in various ways, such as on textured shorts suits, rain macs, as well as Samba sneakers and white rubber Clogs, as part of a partnership with Adidas. He is in the running for the New Establishment men''s wear award, a new category at this year''s Fashion Awards. This is where you should watch this space. ","Daniel Lee chose to paint the town blue for his second show. The British fashion house took over the Bond Street tube station, where platform signs were replaced during fashion week to say \"Burberry Street\", a move that baffled scores of tourists and foreigners who missed their stops. ","Three new museum exhibitions devoted to fashion opened in London last weekend.","The Victoria and Albert Museum has a documentary on the woman called Coco, who became the architect of the modern woman''s wardrobe.","The archive of Joe Casely-Hayford is at the heart of the story of the \"The Missing Thread: Untold Stories of Black British Fashion\", which tells the story of Black creativity from the 1970s to the present day that was misrepresented or excluded from the mainstream industry narrative.","The Design Museum is about to show pieces from the first collection of some of the city''s best-known designers, who were supported by the British Fashion Council''s Newgen talent program. In the case of Alexander McQueen, after his 1993 show, the designer left some of his garments in garbage bags near a dumpster outside a nightclub because he didn''t want to pay the bill for the rest of the night. He only remembered when he woke up the next morning. The clothes weren''t seen again. ","Sarah Mower said she wanted the retrospective to be about the culture of the clothes and not just about what is in the show. The exhibition is situated in the areas dedicated to student design and the nightclub queue, as well as the backstage of a runway show. It is full of nostalgia but also full of excitement as to what is to come in the London fashion scene. "]');

The kind of internet-driven microfame that we now call \"influencing\", was pioneered by a media strategist who was once a New York City journalist and media personality. Allison was going through another break up. She wondered what the point of it all was, and she thought it was not the plan. It was thirty-nine and single. Ms, what has my life been like? Allison needed to consult the Harvard Law School''s Felix Frankfurter professor of law, Noah Feldman, even though she didn''t know it at the time. ","Like Ms. Mr. Allison, you are Mr. In the aughts, he rose to prominence in Lower Manhattan, as a wunderkind constitutional law scholar at the N.Y.U. He advised the Iraqis in 2003 to write their Constitution after the U.S. Also like Ms. Mr. Allison, you are Mr. Since his divorce, he''s been unlucky in love. ","A mutual friend had described Mr and the two had never spoken before. Feldman to Ms. Allison was named \"the world''s most fascinating man.\" Through the friend, she had Mr. The number she called was from the hot spring. He picked up the woman in front of him. Allison asked what the meaning of life was. They talked for 90 minutes. ","I know that Noah said something that was profound but I can''t remember what he said. Allison said something. ","The discreet courting that has been over the last three and a half years has not been made public. They are Allison and Mr. They are engaged to each other. ","It was an unlikely match on the surface. Ms. A woman named Allison, 42, is a 10-time Burning Man attendee who has lived in California for a decade, her friends include start-up chief executives andpsychopaths, and she considers Indonesia her spiritual home. Ms. Allison describes a time in her life where she dated for 10 years with polyamorous D.J.s. Allison said that she dated a congressman from the other side of the aisle.

","Mr said that people he dated were people of substance. In his office, he said in a recent interview. They wereDistinguished in their professions. Allison and Mr are sitting together. There was a person who smiled. ","She said, in a stage whisper, that she had serious people on her mind.","But Ms. Mr. received Allison''s call early in the Covid restrictions. He was questioning the basics of human connection as he neared 50, teaching remotely and spending much of his time alone at home. ","He said that he wasn''t optimistic in his romantic life. He wondered, \"Will anyone ever meet a human again?\" The pair spoke for over three months after that first call, often for hours at a time. Mr. Ms was invited by Feldman. Allison is in Maine, where he has a home. ","It took a bit of convincing. Ms. Allison wasn''t sure if she wanted a bicoastal romance or not, she was also not sure about the East Coast in general. She was committed to California, despite the fact that she felt their chemistry was obvious. Ms. Allison moved there in the late 2000s after a half decade in New York gossip pages, where she became a fixture and was profiled by The Times as a kind of neo-Candace Bushnell, a dating columnist whom people both loved and hated. Ms, an attention economy savant. Allison was best known for being a foil to the gossip website, but she was far from the only one who covered her social life. In return, she gained a lot of toxic fame thanks to the internet, which was a sign of the culture to come. ","Taylor Lorenz, a Washington Post tech columnist and chroniclers of social media influence, said that she was too early. Ms was scared by the experience, and she said she had predicted it all. Allison has been out of the spotlight for most of the time she''s been alive. She inquired about Mr early on in their phone calls. Not to look up her on the internet.

They spent five days together at the farmers market, picking out produce, lying in the grass, and, as Ms said, it was a beautiful, moving image. Allison said she was attracted to the man because she kissed on Noah''s boat. ","There was an acculturation process for Mr, but it was not as extensive as it could have been. He is not really a no-one-is-watching type. Ms, to begin with. Allison was immersed in a scene about a man and Burning Man. There was nothing that Feldman knew that he didn''t already know. ","I didn''t know that many of Julia''s friends had jobs until I met her. It was Feldman who said it. One of them is a fire dancer. She has a friend called purple, he only wears purple and his métier is bodywork and she has also a friend named Noah, she is learning how to have fun. Allison said it didn''t sound right to make it seem like she wasn''t telling the truth. He is a fast learner.Ms. Mr was taken by Allison.

Feldman was tense at first but as he went north through the villages he felt removed from the strict intellectual culture of Cambridge, Mass. ","It might be as far away as you can go from Boston.","Burning Man, a weeklong event where tens of thousands of people gather to camp and revel in the Nevada desert and worldly achievements aren''t supposed to matter, came the final exam in the fall of 2022, in the fall of the 21st century.","It would be a huge understatement to say that Noah was nervous about Burning Man.

","For all the changes, that''s still Mr. Ms was the person who made it. Allison was going to pull up stakes. She started her master''s program at the Harvard Kennedy School last month, after she moved to Cambridge. She hopes to work on issues that are important to her, such as environmental justice, gender issues and animal rights. ","She missed Burning Man for the first time in a decade because of her course load, a sign of kismet in and of itself.","She has moved in with Mr. The 5,000- square-foot mansard-roofed home that Feldman has with her fiancé has been redecorated. ","She said that it was a sad, beige house for a sad, beige bachelor.","Ms. The changes include pink wallpaper with a pattern of monkeys and leopards, and thick velvet drapes, as well as antique chandeliers throughout the house, and a deep blue velvet couch in the living room that is not typically associated with lounging. ","Now, Ms. Allison calls the house and sends guests a mission statement ahead of time. The message said that the home was more than dwelling. It is a space of exploration and enlightenment, made up of diverse minds and spirits. Allison wants the house to be where the free-spirited vibe of Burning Man can mix with the cerebral culture of Cambridge. ","Senator Booker said that his friendNoah was a sharp edge that needed to be softened while he was also a square that needed to be rounded. He said that this woman is a gift to him, a guy who has been walking a narrow path toward extraordinary success all his life and who has been close to him since they were Rhodes scholars together at the University of Oxford. She was on the side of the road in the field with the wildflowers, and she got him off the path and onto the dance floor. Mr. The author of a book about contemporary Judaism grew up in Orthodoxy.

Ms. The Burning Man friends of Allison place a high premium on physical touch and soft surfaces. Allison wore her full-length pink dress around her as she sat on the floor in front of them. The potential for MDMA to treat trauma, the 19th-century German sociologist Max Weber and the nature of love are some of the topics discussed in the conversation.

He is a man who is part of a patriarchal system and she is a woman who is looking to have an unconventional life in warm climates. Allison laughed at the absurdity of it all. She stated that the two worlds could do so much together. ","The physicist reclined in a lounge chair and offered that the hippies had saved physics, to the murmurs of assent.

New York magazine named the most famous designer they hadn''t heard of. ","He was the man behind the renaissance of the brand at the age of 30, after the founding designer left the house. He was thought to be the secret sauce in Philo''s Céline collections a few years later. Then he was helping with the redesign at Calvin Klein. He didn''t take a bow at the end of the runway, even though his name kept coming up in reference to top designer jobs. He was not photographed very often. He did not hang out with celebrities. ","In British Vogue, Suzy Menkes said that a talent like that can''t be kept under wraps. Except he did, it''s the only thing that''s not true. ","This has been the case until now.","In the late year of the 21st century Mr. Daniel Lee, the designer who had reinvented the brand in only three years, left the company due to rumors about misbehavior and high employee turnover. Mr. Blazy had been Mr. Lee''s number isn''t the same as the one you see in the picture. His headline gig, and a house shrouded in innuendo and need of yet another sprinkling of fairy dust were not the only things that made him inherit the house. He fooled everyone by changing leather into denim, flannel, ribbed cotton and knit. He made the everyday into precious objects for the person who really knows them, by pulling out the rug from under assumptions. He created a world where nothing is quite as it looks, and populated it with a lot of people. He was playing sleight of hand with the hierarchy of taste. ","He did it so well this month, that Bergdorf Goodman in New York filled three of its windows with Bottega Veneta, according to Linda Fargo, who is the senior vice president for fashion and store presentation. Mr has been at the job for two years. He has defined a direction for the brand, Blazy has redefined a brand. ","There is a growing tension between designers who make content and designers who make clothes. The clothes crew sees fashion as a service, while the content crew considers fashion to be a subset of entertainment. ","The appointment of Pharrell Williams as creative director of Louis Vuitton mens wear was in many ways apotheosis of the content phenomenon, in which what really matters is the spectacle and how it is received through the world. You can buy the souvenirs that allow you to buy into the experience and advertise your belonging. ","Mr. The epitome of an alternative approach is Blazy, a designer who puts himself second to the products, the people who make them and the people who buy them. Franois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, the company that owns Bottega Veneta, stated that the man didn''t see himself in the driver''s seat. He knows where everyone is going, but he sees himself in the middle of the car. ","I wanted to go against the stream of the monovision, that''s what I said. Blazy talked about the first pitch he made to Mr. Pinault was the subject of a movie. He was in his office at the Bottega Veneta headquarters in Milan and wore a white T-shirt and faded jeans. ","Mr was told by him. Pinault believed that the brand should be \"a house, not a brand\" and that it should be \"craft, rather than design.\" That may sound strange, but is it really a difference between a garment that slips into a wardrobe and a garment that advertises its point of origin? The approach of Mr was very different from that of this one. Lee, who made the name Bottega so associated with a single color it''s difficult to tell a piece from a block away. It explains a lot about Mr. Blazy doesn''t approach his job, but the world. ","The walls of his office were repaneled in wood tinted a rich brown to make them look like a chateau, and it made the room feel more domestic. At one end of it is a seating area with a head on a pedestal in the middle and at the other it is a long table for meetings. The table has Ricola lemon mint lozenges, but they are not connected to the internet. ","Mr didn''t open a computer in the last six months. Blazy said it was true. I have two, but I don''t use them a lot. He had sketches on the floor, he had a phone, he had a bunch of different piles of papers, he had new store ideas, he had Perfume, and he had fanzines. The girl is playing with pen and ink, watercolor and glitter. Blazy was going to perform his last show. ","There were a number of artworks on the walls. Mr. Blazy has first drafts. He said that they started because he could not afford it, and that he liked the idea that they were the first expression of something. ","He said that it was not that he needed to have more. Sometimes I try to find something that makes me happy to live with, two or three times a year. He smokes a pack a day and has a rug designed in the image of the stracciatella ice cream that he loves so much. ","Pierre Debusschere, the image and music director for Bottega, said that he can get inspired by anything. It is not a coincidence that one of them is a person that is related to a person that is unrelated to a person that is related to a person that is unrelated to a person that is unrelated to a person that is unrelated to a person that is unrelated to a person that is unrelated to The Church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro in Milan has a flat wall painted in trompe l''oeil that appears to be a false apse from the front, but in actuality it''s a flat wall painted on top of trompe l''oeil. ","The way the co-creative director of Prada ,   ,,, Mr.,..... ........... Blazy is one of his best friends and he says that his boss, Matt, is very free in his head. He doesn''t have a fear of showing something he believes in. He always had a few ideas that made no sense, and ones that were so genius he would say, \"Sure, we are going to do that.\" Blazy said that before Bottega Veneta, he received job offers. He wouldn''t say which one was beautiful, commercial, or still about fashion, but he did say that one was a small house, that he thought could be reactivated without being passed over. I didn''t think it was the right time. I saw a lot of designers taking things fast, and it was important for me to build myself first. I wanted to know what my job was like, I wanted to know what it was like to work there. Mr, know yourself. Blazy was born in Paris and moved to the US when he was a child. His father is a renowned artist, and his mother is a researcher, and he has an older brother who is an airplane pilot, as well as a twin sister who works in Singapore. He was so rambunctious that his parents had to send him to a school in France when he was 13 because he was too rowdy. Pangbourne College, a military boarding school in England, was where he ended up for a year, after his parents decided against sending him to a school in France He thought about going into archaeology but ended up at a fashion school because his mother wanted him to have a skill, and Julien Dossena, the creative director of Rabanne, was in his class. He had a graduate collection about a woman who became the first Frenchwoman in space and had big fur coats covered in silver fabric. Blazy said something. I had a lot of fun. He offered Mr the collection after he liked it so much. A job at his namesake label as a men''s designer is what Blazy was hired to do. The designer who was already working there was named Pieter Mulier, as was the designer who was already working with Mr. The two of them soon became a couple. ","Mr said they did everything together. The person said that, Simons said. Mr went to fabric fairs in Paris, went to the movies, and went on vacation but he''s still in his 20s. The brand''s equivalent of couture, that Blazy jumped to was the Margiela Artisanal collection. He began to experiment with the idea of transformation using plastic hair combs as a representation offringe. ","He said that he could really use his passion for digging and being curious. He went to Céline because he was afraid he would be pigeonholed as a conceptualist, and then to Calvin Klein, because he wanted to work on more commercial precollections. Mr and Mr are related to sphinx and sphinx are related to Mr and Mr are related to Mr and Mr are related to Mr and Mr are related to Mr and Mr are related to Mr and Mr are related to Mr and Mr are related to Mr and Mr are Once again, Mulier. ","It was, Mr, at least according to the fact that it was. Blazy said it was like a high school reunion. It was a very nice thing to have in your life. We are going to meet new people, and then we are going to live in New York. Mulier rented a weekend place in Connecticut where he had a rescue puppy named John John. ","Calvin Klein''s collections became less about the American dream than about the American nightmare, which was somewhat to the dismay of the conglomerate that owned Calvin Klein. Mr. After two years, he and his inner circle were fired. ","Mr said that it was hell. Blazy said something. He did not say what it was or who it was Blazy did not say what it was or who it was You put your boxes on the street. He thought about quitting fashion, because he thought he was the main character in a movie. He was going to Los Angeles to help the artist with his collection but ended up going to Florence to show it to the crowds at the Pitti Uomo trade fair. ","The design director at Céline was Daniel Lee. Blazy came calling and said he had just been given the task of updating Bottega Veneta. And though Mr, at least that''s how it''s supposed to be. Blazy was said to have gotten fed up with Mr. When the chief executive was looking for Lee, he resigned because of his erratic leadership and he refused to discuss the situation. Mr said it was clear we had the right person here. First, to challenge himself to make something that is Wearable, was Blazy''s goal when he approached Bottega Veneta. He said that because we are expensive, it should be an investment. We want to interact with the world we live in. He said that timeless is a word he can''t hear anymore. It is more of a responsibility that we have as designers to offer something that lasts. ","The first thing he did was reduce the size of the design teams to make it easier for everyone to sit at the same table. He put the leather workers and fabric developers in the middle of every conversation. ","Mr said that he knows everyone''s name. The person said, \"Rongone.\" He is listening to everyone. Mr said that he brought a new mood to the studio. The person said Pinault. The first thing he asked for was leather jeans, the first thing he asked for in the meeting. ","Mr said that the first response was not possible. Blazy said something about it being in the vicinity of it being in the vicinity of him being in the vicinity of it being in the vicinity of it being in the vicinity of it being in the vicinity of him being in the vicinity of it being in the vicinity of it being in the vicinity He said the teams went through about 30 to 40 tests, but until one day his staff took him a sample and he thought it was cotton. Mr said he would always remember that day, as those jeans sold out in two weeks. \"Blazy said\", he said. ","Mr. The Andiamo bag is a practical intrecciATO style that Mr. Blazy thinks about in products that serve a function. The best selling item at Bottega is a \"sardine bag\" from the last collection, which has a glass handle that looks like a Brancusi fish. There is a more accessible brass version for the handles, but they aren''t exactly the same. Bergdorf sold three of the 25 bags that were produced, which were priced at $11,000 each. \"Fargo said that.\" Mr said it was at this stage. The Pinault brand is close to becoming the third- largest brand in the group, just after Gucci and Saint Yves, and competing with the other brands. ","Ms said that even their most commercial pieces are special. Fargo said that''s what he said. We are all in on it. Blazy has an apartment in Milan, after surfing a number of places on the internet. Mr. Mulier is the creative director of Alaa. The apartment at the top of the building looks a bit like a houseboat, but Blazy split up earlier this year, and they share custody of the dog, which is still too hard for him to talk about. ","Mr thought, \"This looks familiar\", when he walked in. Blazy was the one who said it. It was found that he was renting the same apartment as Mr. During his time as the creative director of Jil Sander, Simons rented for a period of time. ","He and Mr share a flat over the course of a week. Debusschere was the person who was the subject of the movie Debusschere. In the middle of the night, they plan meetings in the kitchen with music and drinks, while in the morning they look over the roofs of Milan and drink coffee. Mr. Blazy often brings art from his house to his office. He shot the most recent Bottega ad campaign in the courtyard of the apartment, with Mariacarla Boscono and his doorman. ","He has been thinking a lot about nature in the last couple of weeks. He said to his team that he was interested in fish. Can we see birds? I saw a woman in the street. She was walking in a pair of shorts. I think it is interesting. Can we try? Maybe it isn''t as perfect as it could be. Is it possible to make it less perfect? ","He asked his team, \"Would you wear this?\" when they were in the studio. He wants to know, \"Why did you design it?\" Last season he began styling his shows himself, which he will do again this season. He said that he would prefer to make his own mistakes. ","He is glad he took the time to get to where he is now. Even if I doubt, a question mark can become not just ''I don''t know,''\" he said. It can become an adventure. "]');

Canadian nationals, a sharp escalation in the diplomatic conflict that has followed Canada’s claim that Indian agents were behind an assassination in June on Canadian soil.","Arindam Bagchi, the Indian foreign ministry spokesman, described the move as a technical and security issue, saying on Thursday that the country’s high commission and consulates in Canada were “temporarily unable” to process visas because of safety threats.","“This has disrupted their normal function,” Mr. Bagchi said during a regularly scheduled news briefing, adding: “We will be reviewing the situation on a regular basis.”But the suspension came as tensions between India and Canada have soared in the days since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in Parliament that Canada’s intelligence services had information linking the Indian government to the killing of a Sikh separatist in British Columbia on June 18.","The Indian government on Tuesday forcefully rejected the claim that it had been involved in the assassination of the Sikh Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, and accused Canada of harboring terrorists who are seeking to carve a Sikh homeland out of India’s territory.","India then moved to expel a high-ranking Canadian diplomat from New Delhi. Canada had expelled an Indian diplomat — described as the head of New Delhi’s intelligence agency in Canada — the day before.","On Thursday, Mr. Bagchi signaled that more Canadian diplomats could soon leave India, in what he called a step to ensure “parity” between the two countries’ diplomatic presences.","“Their numbers here are very much higher than ours in Canada,” he said. “The details of this are being worked out, but I assume there will be a reduction from the Canadian side.”Canadians have voiced outrage at the possibility that the Indian government had played a role in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. In July, protesters outside the Indian Consulate General in Toronto promoted the Sikh secessionist cause with signs that accused Indian diplomats of being behind Mr. Nijjar’s death.","On Wednesday, the Indian foreign ministry pointed to what it called threats to the safety of its citizens and diplomats. It advised Indian citizens living in or traveling to Canada to “exercise utmost caution” because of what it described as an increase in “anti-India activities and politically condoned hate crimes and criminal violence in Canada.”“Recently, threats have particularly targeted Indian diplomats and sections of the Indian community who oppose the anti-India agenda,” the advisory said, adding that Indian nationals should avoid traveling to regions and sites in Canada that had seen such incidents.","Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s minister of public safety, dismissed India’s travel warning in remarks to reporters in Ottawa.","“People can read into that what they want,” he said. “Canada is a safe country. What we’re doing is ensuring there’s an appropriate criminal investigation into these circumstances.”Canada said on Wednesday that its own diplomats had received threats on social media, announcing that it was pulling some of them out of India to ensure their safety.","The Canadian government has yet to release any details about its intelligence findings in Mr. Nijjar’s death, saying that doing so could damage the police investigation and reveal the country’s intelligence-gathering methods. Canada has asked for India’s assistance in the inquiry.","“We are not looking to provoke or escalate,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters on Tuesday. “We are simply laying out the facts as we understand them, and we want to work with the government of India.”Relations between India and Canada have plunged this week to what officials and analysts call the lowest point in history after years of simmering tension.","The Indian government has long accused Canada and other Western nations of inaction as extremist Sikh groups in the Indian diaspora — including the one led by Mr. Nijjar — have supported a secessionist movement that threatens India’s sovereignty.","Canada has said that it respects the right of all of its citizens to freedom of speech in advocating political causes. Indian officials say that Canadian politicians are reluctant to curb Sikh extremism because of the lobbying sway of the group, the largest population of Sikhs outside India.","Officials in India have accused Canada, Britain, the United States and Australia of standing by as those pushing for what is known as Khalistan, the independent nation that Sikh secessionists want to establish in the Punjab region of India, have vandalized Indian diplomatic missions and threatened Indian diplomats.","Mr. Bagchi, the Indian foreign ministry spokesman, said on Thursday that all categories of visas, including e-visas, would be halted, and that Canadians would be unable to apply for a visa through a third country.","The Indian government had been forced to suspend visas, he said, because of “incitement to violence, the inaction by Canadian authorities and the creation of an environment that disrupts the function of our high commission and consulates.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/world/asia/india-canada-visas.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/21/multimedia/21india-canada-pclv/21india-canada-pclv-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-21 10:04:43+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:37.254099+00');

'By Denise Hruby', 'world', '["Johannes Fritz, a maverick Austrian biologist, needed to come up with a plan, again, if he was going to prevent his rare and beloved birds from going extinct.","To survive the European winter, the northern bald ibis — which had once disappeared entirely from the wild on the continent — needs to migrate south for the winter, over the Alps, before the mountains become impassable.","But shifting climate patterns have delayed when the birds begin to migrate, and they are now reaching the mountains too late to make it over the peaks, locking them in an icy death trap.","“Two or three years, and they’d be extinct again,” Mr. Fritz said.","Determined to save them, Mr. Fritz decided he would teach the birds a new, safer migration route by guiding them himself in a tiny aircraft. And he was confident he could succeed in this daring, unconventional plan — because he had done it before.","When Mr. Fritz was born 56 years ago, the northern bald ibis, a goose-sized black bird with a bald head and an enormous beak, could be found in Europe only in captivity. Some 400 years ago, Europeans likely devoured the last of them.","But Mr. Fritz has spent his career reintroducing the birds into the wild, and an essential part of their education has been teaching the young the migration path they will follow as adults.","Mr. Fritz learned to fly, modifying an ultralight aircraft so it would cruise at speeds slow enough for his winged students to keep up.","He was his young pupils’ sole provider of food, love and cuddles since they’d been just a few days old, and the ibises eagerly followed their teacher — who just happens to pilot a fairly noisy machine.","In 2004, three years after some initially bumpy experiments, Mr. Fritz led the first flock from Austria to Italy, and has since led 15 such migrations. Over that time, he has rewilded 277 young ibises, many of which then started to pass the route on to their own young.","But the route he originally taught the ibises is no longer viable. With climate change warming the area where the birds summer — by Lake Constance in Germany and Austria — they now start their migration at the end of October instead of the end of September, as they had done just a decade ago.","Last year, as he followed the birds’ progress, Mr. Fritz found snow covering the ibises’ feathers, and their long beaks struggled to find larvae and worms in the frosty soil. Three colonies of ibises each tried two times to traverse the mountains in November, but failed every time, with Mr. Fritz hypothesizing that rising warm air flows were too weak by November to allow the birds to soar with ease over the mountains.","Mr. Fritz and his team lured the ravenous animals with mealworms, trapped them in crates and chauffeured them over the Alps.","But a private coach service, Mr. Fritz realized, wasn’t a sustainable solution, and so he came up with the idea to show the birds a new migration path.","At Lake Constance this summer, humans and birds were in flight school, practicing the escorted flights for their epic journey. By October, they hope to reach Spain’s southern Atlantic coast, by Cadiz, where the birds could comfortably winter.","Bypassing the mighty Alps, the new route is about 2,500 miles, or some three times longer than their previous one directly south to Tuscany. Flying at a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour, the trip is expected to take about six weeks, as opposed to the two to reach Tuscany.","Still, “we’re optimistic that it’ll work,” said Mr. Fritz as he pushed his aircraft on a meadow that serves as landing strip.","His aircraft is a three-wheeled vehicle attached to a propeller and canopy resembling a parachute, but Mr. Fritz insists it’s safe — and unlike the gliders in which he learned to fly, it doesn’t make him sick.","Growing up on a mountain farm in Tyrol, Mr. Fritz enjoyed watching how cows and horses interacted with each other more freely — nuzzling and playing — once they’d been led out of the barn and into pasture. These boyhood observations fostered his dream of becoming a biologist.","At 20, he enrolled in a program that would eventually allow him to study biology at university but first, he had to train as a state hunter with responsibility for keeping local animal populations in check.","In rough Alpine terrain, he monitored the health of chamois and deer herds, while refusing to kill them. Only once, at the repeated insistence of his boss, did he ever pull the trigger. “An orphaned fawn, which would have died,” said Mr. Fritz, who called the shooting a “dark spot” in his professional life.","He was 24 when he finally began studying at universities in Vienna and Innsbruck. He later landed work at Austria’s Konrad Lorenz Research Center, raising raven chicks by hand and teaching graylag geese how to open boxes as he pursued his Ph.D. Working this closely with free-living animals was exactly what he’d dreamed of as a boy.","In 1997, a zoo gave the research center its first northern bald ibis chicks. Nowhere near as teachable as geese — and not even close to superintelligent ravens — the ibises frustrated most of the scientists.","But Mr. Fritz was enamored. When people joke that their red, wrinkled heads and black mohawks put them in the running for world’s ugliest bird, he points to their charisma, gregariousness and affection. He knows what chicks love to eat — shredded mice and beef heart, eight times a day — and the curious birds enjoy poking their long beaks gently into his ears.","After the ibises were first released back into the wild more than 20 years ago, Mr. Fritz learned that spending generations in zoological confinement hadn’t abated their drive to migrate, though it did leave them geographically uninformed. In their search for “south,” some ended up in Russia.","What the ibises needed, Mr. Fritz thought, was a guide.","“Around that time, ‘Fly Away Home’ was a huge hit with us biologists,” Mr. Fritz says, recalling the 1996 movie in which characters played by Jeff Daniels and Anna Paquin lead the migration of orphaned Canada geese in a hang glider. When Mr. Fritz proclaimed he’d do the same with the ibises, he was initially ridiculed.","But through years of trial and error,  he succeeded. He even learned to fly like a bird, he said, soaring with ease.","Mr. Fritz''s two sons, both now teenagers, followed their flying father and the migrating birds on the ground, and his family and colleagues witnessed the risks he was taking.","“Luckily, whenever the motor stopped working, we were somewhere we could still land,” Mr. Fritz said. Once, he crashed so hard into a cornfield, his team feared him dead. When they found him nearly unscathed in a wrecked aircraft, his first response was: “We need to get this fixed immediately.”Today, he prioritizes safety, he said, in part because he is no longer the only one taking the risks. The ibises are now raised by two research assistants who function as human foster mothers, one flying in the back of Mr. Fritz’s aircraft, the other with a second pilot.","On a blistering hot morning at their Lake Constance campsite, Mr. Fritz zipped up his olive-green jumpsuit and hopped into his aircraft, turning around to check on the 35 ibises and signaling for one of the foster mothers to get in the seat behind him. As they rise above the grassy airstrip, the birds flap their black wings, following just behind.","Soon, they’ll fly west to France, then south to the Mediterranean, where they’ll trace the coast all the way to Andalusia, one of the hottest and driest regions on the continent, dealing with unpredictable weather along the way.","But the inevitable risks are “necessary,” Mr. Fritz said.","“It’s not so much a job,” he added, “but my life’s purpose.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/world/europe/johannes-fritz-ibises-migration.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/18/multimedia/18germany-fritz-profile-01-lcmk/18germany-fritz-profile-01-lcmk-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-08-18 09:00:55+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:37.44376+00');

0.006150491535663605]', 'By Manuela Andreoni and Jack Nicas', 'world', '["Jair Candor had been searching the Amazon rainforest for three days when he heard their voices. He had spent a decade documenting their tracks, but that day back in 2011 was his first time seeing them: a family of nine, trekking through the forest nude with children on their backs and arrows taller than him.","For years, logging companies had said this isolated Indigenous group was a myth. But now Mr. Candor, hidden behind slim trees, was recording the first-ever video of them.","When he was done, he cursed the loggers and dared them to say the tribe didn’t exist, his colleague Claiton Gabriel Silva said. Mr. Candor’s eyes were wet with tears.","Mr. Candor, 63, is perhaps the most accomplished tracer of isolated tribes in Brazil, one of a waning number hired by the Brazilian government to explore some of the most untouched patches of the Amazon to find evidence of groups that have lived largely unseen and uncontacted for generations.","The job is not to contact the tribes but to protect them. The law requires proof that isolated groups exist before their land can be placed off limits to outsiders. Mr. Candor tries to spot the tribes without being spotted, to allow them to remain isolated and to protect himself.","“My curiosity is great,” Mr. Candor said. “But the respect for their rights is greater.”Over 35 years, he has led hundreds of expeditions into the forest, catching malaria dozens of times, by his own estimate, and surviving two attempts on his life, one in which an Indigenous man fired arrows at his team and another when a group of loggers attacked the base where he worked.","Mr. Candor has discovered evidence of four tiny civilizations, each of which researchers believe has its own language, culture and stories. They include Brazil’s smallest known tribe, the Piripkura, and its three remaining survivors. His work has led to legal protections that cover nearly 7,000 square miles, an area of rainforest bigger than Puerto Rico, making him one of the single most effective figures working on Amazon preservation today.","Such protections are critical for the rainforest as it fast approaches a tipping point that could transform large areas into grasslands and turn a place that stores huge amounts of heat-trapping gases into a net emitter.","The work has also earned him plenty of enemies. One morning in June, as he sped along a rutted dirt road into the forest at 50 miles an hour, he talked about politicians who have pressured his bosses to fire him, farmers who have tried to bribe him and loggers who have tried to hire assassins to kill him. Now he keeps a shiny 9-millimeter pistol in his bulletproof vest.","“I’m not scared,” he said. “What worries me are snakes,” he added with a smile.","The video he filmed in 2011 was of the Kawahiva do Rio Pardo, one of the 115 groups thought to live in isolation in Brazil, the most of any country. A lack of proof means that roughly a third of those groups remain unprotected, making expert trackers like Mr. Candor, who have learned how to find forest dwellers who don’t want to be found, critical to their survival.","Mr. Candor’s family moved to the Amazon when he was 6. It was the 1960s, and his parents had decided to answer a call by the country’s military dictatorship to colonize the rainforest. They would help to subdue “the green hell,” as the government called it, and earn a plot of land for their trouble.","Three years later, Mr. Candor’s mother died. His family scattered, and a group of rubber tappers eventually adopted him. Soon, he stopped going to school and began learning how to survive in the wilderness.","By 1988, the military government had fallen and Brazil was working to approve a new constitution that recognized the rights of Indigenous people over their land. To protect them, the government needed new experts in the rainforest. Mr. Candor, 28 at the time, had earned a reputation for working hard and making friends with Indigenous people in the forest. The government hired him.","Mr. Candor quickly showed a knack for the job. He learned from Indigenous people how to spot signs of those who chose to live apart. There were the broken Brazil nut shells, or bunches of toxic plants left by streams, used to stun fish in order to catch them.","Cut-off branches can tell a lot, too. The direction of the cut can indicate which way someone was walking, and the height how tall they were. A closer inspection may reveal how sharp the machete was. Tribes living in isolation can’t sharpen the machetes they steal from nearby communities.","Then, there are the signs Mr. Candor can’t explain. Something tells him to stop, and then he finds it — a shelter, a ceramic pot, the leftovers of a meal. Maybe he can hear what birds are saying, like some Indigenous people claim they do, or he has an Indigenous man’s spirit inside him, as a priestess once told him.","“It’s a spiritual thing,” his deputy, Rodrigo Ayres, said. “Inside the forest, there’s a mode of communication that we can’t explain according to our worldview. And Jair can tap into that.”In the first expedition he led on his own, in 1989, Mr. Candor found two members of the Piripkura, whom the government had been seeking for four years. Another tribe had given them the name, which means butterfly, because of how fast they flitted through the forest. He noticed how little they needed to survive: fire, a couple of hammocks, a blunt machete.","“We need a home, we need a car, we need a bunch of crap,” he said. “Then you meet these two guys, living happily with nothing, no clothes, no supermarket, no water or electricity bill.”Mr. Candor soon started detaching, too. In 1992, an expedition ran longer than expected and he missed his own wedding day. The bride didn’t want him back. He later married a different woman and had two sons. But he still comes home only about eight times a year.","Mr. Candor also lost a sense of safety. In 2018, an informant warned him that a group of men connected to loggers were on their way to attack him.","He was at a government base in the forest. It was too remote for the authorities to come help. But instead of fleeing, he decided he and his team would protect the base, even though his adult son was visiting. He gave guns to his son and six colleagues. His son got the only bulletproof vest.","He told everyone to stand in an arrowhead formation, so they wouldn’t hit each other, and shoot down a slope. “I saw it in a movie,” he said.","The nine men broke the lock on the gate around 9 p.m. Mr. Candor and his crew heard shots, they said, so they fired back. One of the invaders was killed. The others ran away. The investigation that followed didn’t find evidence that the men connected to the loggers were carrying guns, but their leader was arrested.","Two years later, in 2020, one of Mr. Candor’s colleagues was killed by an arrow shot by the member of a tribe he had been watching over for decades. And last year, Bruno Pereira, a specialist on isolated tribes from a younger generation of experts, was killed along with a British journalist, Dom Phillips, for his work helping to protect land that had been preserved for isolated tribes.","Mr. Candor was close with both of the Indigenous experts who died, and he knows they could have been him. He says he thinks he only has another four or five years before retirement. But until then, he said, he will keep risking his life to help Indigenous tribes.","“We are the only people fighting for this,” he said. “Their voice out here is us.”Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/world/americas/jair-candor-amazon-tribes-indigenous.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/25/multimedia/25cli-braziltracker-profile-01-jfbh/25cli-braziltracker-profile-01-jfbh-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-08-25 09:02:48+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:37.933684+00');

heard the story of Solomon Shereshevsky, you haven’t forgotten it. Shereshevsky’s powers of memory were so remarkable that in 1929 he gave up his job as a journalist in Moscow and joined the circus. He could recite lists of numbers, poems in foreign languages, even strings of random syllables that were called out to him from the audience. His world was abundant in particulars, brimming with imagery and sensations. When asked to share his understanding of the number 87, he said he envisioned it as “a fat woman and a man twirling his mustache.”But his extraordinary gift was also a terrible affliction. Shereshevsky couldn’t generalize from the barrage of specific inputs he experienced. Communicating with others was exhausting. Forgetting something wasn’t a matter of passively letting it slip away into oblivion; he had to actively destroy it in his mind. If each and every thing you encounter is charged with a singular meaning, gathering those bits together into a coherent picture becomes impossible. In contrast to memorization, remembrance requires the slight blur of abstraction. As William Egginton writes in “The Rigor of Angels,” a “perfect memory” can begin to resemble “total forgetting.”Shereshevsky makes only a cameo appearance in Egginton’s mind-expanding book, but his plight opens up a portal into thinking about space and time and our place in both. Challenging, ambitious, yet also elegantly written, “The Rigor of Angels” explores nothing less than “the ultimate nature of reality” through the life and work of three figures: the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges; the German theoretical physicist and pioneer of quantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg; and the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Egginton, a literary scholar at Johns Hopkins, brings these three very different men together in one book because they all shared something unusual. They resisted the temptation to presume that there was a reality, out there, that was completely independent of our attempts to know it.","The formidable creativity of their work was, as Egginton puts it, a matter of “letting go” of what we assume must be real. This turns out to be exceedingly difficult to do. Even Albert Einstein, whose name is synonymous with genius, had trouble doing it. In 1915, he did let go — though only up to a point. His theory of relativity required him “to disregard what everyone knew about space and time in favor of what the data were telling him,” Egginton writes. But Einstein’s own calculations were telling him that the universe was either shrinking or expanding, and so he inserted a cosmological constant to maintain the fiction that the universe (which is in fact expanding) remained a constant size.","In the 1920s, Einstein sparred with Heisenberg over quantum mechanics — which unsettled what physicists at the time took to be “the ultimate nature of reality.” Einstein’s theories of relativity could explain the workings of the universe at the grand, cosmological scale, but Heisenberg found something very different at the subatomic level. Egginton describes how the “smooth continuity of matter’s movement” is replaced by “violent quantum fluctuations.” Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle was especially offensive to Einstein; Einstein refused to accept that particles like electrons would follow a distinct path only once they were observed. In Benjamín Labatut’s recent genre-bending nonfiction novel “When We Cease to Understand the World,” Heisenberg is memorably described as someone “who seemed to have gouged out both his eyes in order to see further.”Egginton gestures at connections between the work of Heisenberg, Kant and Borges, between physics and metaphysics, fiction and fact. All three men were fascinated by paradox, or antinomies — situations in which “both options seemed at once absolutely necessary and utterly impossible.” Each realized that such dilemmas arise when we mix up different modes of thinking. In Zeno’s famous paradox, Achilles will never catch the tortoise who gets a head start if we define the race in terms of a distance between them that is infinitely divisible into ever smaller slices. But of course, in an actual race, Achilles will eventually catch the tortoise; the paradox emerges from how we imagine the race in the first place.","This is a book about the tiniest of things — the position of an electron, an instant of change. It is also about the biggest of things — the cosmos, infinity, the possibility of free will. Egginton works through ideas by grounding them in his characters’ lives. Heisenberg’s scientific research was so bold, yet his political engagements were curiously cautious and passive; in the 1930s, he seemed unable to grasp the monstrousness of the Nazi regime. But Egginton says that Heisenberg’s behavior may not have been as paradoxical as it seems. Heisenberg’s “preternatural patience with trying things out” perhaps expressed itself in “a failure to recognize an actual evil in the world and react strongly against it.” The mode of thinking that made him such a brilliant scientist was, Egginton suggests, inhibiting his ability to understand what was happening around him.","In the example of Shereshevsky — not to mention in Borges’s story “Funes the Memorious,” about a young man who was similarly afflicted by powers of total recall — being so preoccupied with details came at the expense of apprehending the bigger picture. Borges describes Funes as “not very good at thinking. To think is to ignore (or forget) differences, to generalize, to abstract.” Yet thinking can also get us into trouble, Egginton shows. Sometimes we can become so enamored of our ideas that we project them onto the world, mistaking our own mode of thought for something as grand as “God’s plan.”The beauty of this book is that Egginton encourages us to recognize all of these complicated truths as part of our reality, even if the “ultimate nature” of that reality will remain forever elusive. We are finite beings whose perspective will always be limited; but those limits are also what give rise to possibility. When we choose what to observe, we insert our freedom to choose into nature.

Nicola Zolin', 'travel', '["They arrive from the port with their colorful clothes and their well-worn musical instruments, parading through the village and performing at the various squares. Islanders view them with a mix of awe and wonder.","At times they look like superheroes, moving together to the rhythm of the music, conjuring tricks like magicians.","I first heard of the Sea Clown Sailing Circus when I was following the stories of refugees crossing Greece. Members of the circus were performing at a camp in Athens, trying to win smiles from children who had experienced too much pain.","Later, I joined the performers in the summer of 2020 on the storied island of Ithaca, in the Ionian Sea. Hoping to sail with the nomad crew, I happened to arrive the very day their engine broke down. Apparently it was a regular occurrence. A technician from the island mocked them: The engines were rusting from lack of use, he said.","It was true that Fred Normal and Alvaro Ramirez, the captains, never wanted to use the engines, aiming instead to sail with the wind as much as possible — even while docking at and departing from the port.","Twenty years earlier, in the United States, Fred, an Alaska-born circus performer, decided it was pointless to try to change the world while traveling with gas-guzzling trucks and caravans. Instead, he resolved to offer his form of utopia to people across the United States and Europe by bicycle. He rode around with his crew from one town to the next, staging pop-up shows and sleeping beside campfires.","Eventually, on the Southern coast of Italy, he met Nikoleta Giakumeli, a Greek acrobat, and Alvaro, a Uruguayan clown who had been traveling around Europe. Together, the trio dreamed up the idea of a seaborne circus, even though none of them had ever formally sailed.","So they learned. For 13 years, Fred and Nikoleta lived on their boat, Surloulou, through summers and winters. After the birth of their daughter, Sirena, who at the age of 4 is already climbing ropes and trying her first tricks as an acrobat, their lives changed dramatically. They now spend less time with the circus, which, despite their absence, continues reinventing itself with new performers and new ideas.","Dozens of artists from all over the world are connected with the Sea Clown Sailing Circus. Some join the crew for only a few days; others join for the whole summer. But a core group of around seven or eight people are trying to bring the circus to a greater acclaim — not only by roaming freely from one Greek island to another, but also by producing more meaningful, and more philosophically engaging, shows.","In the summer of 2021, when I joined the Sea Clowns again for a month, they were producing a new show based on Plato’s allegory of the cave. I saw firsthand how dedicated the performers are to their craft. Though their performances often feel impromptu, the Sea Clowns are in fact immensely disciplined in their preparations. Every act — from acrobatic shows and fire juggling to aerial rope tricks and slacklining — requires a tremendous degree of skill and training. And they simply love to learn.","Being a part of the crew requires being good at sailing, music or circus acts, and ideally all three. But what’s most important is the ability to express enough humor, kindness and respect to live in proximity with a crew of curious artists every day without creating tensions.","It’s also a challenge, of course, to adapt to life on a shoestring budget. “We live or we die by the hat,” Fred would say at the end of every show, inviting the public to offer a donation for the Sea Clowns’ survival.","The life of a street (or water) artist is fragile, delicate — like a tightrope act, or juggling with knives, or sailing through a storm. Yet for most of the crew, nothing seems to offer them a greater sense of freedom. The Sea Clowns ride with their sails open to the wind, confronting both their dreams and an unpredictable future.","“Our work aims to show that nothing is impossible,” Alvaro said, “unless your mind convinces you to believe the opposite.”Nicola Zolin is an Italian photojournalist, writer and filmmaker.

I love summer and everything that comes with it — heat waves, shark sightings, weird smells, you name it.","Last week, panic set in as I realized September is well underway and I haven’t swam, fished, grilled or listened to “Padam Padam” anywhere near as often as I meant to.","But there’s still time. Our beaches are beautiful this month, with acres of wide-open sand to lie on. The water is as warm as it gets, drawing pods of dolphins to spout and breach just offshore. And some of my favorite spots on or near local beaches won’t close for a few more weeks. Others stay open all year long.","There are two burger stands on the boardwalk at what’s called the People’s Beach, and each has its charms. Space Burgers, in Bay 9, the brick building at the west end of the park, flattens its grass-fed patties on a griddle, smashburger-style, giving them a dark and crunchy sear. It’s a fine day-at-the-beach burger, and you can get it with a lemonade slushie. Still, when I pull into the enormous parking lot at Riis, my car usually noses toward a spot at the other end of the beach. Spectro’s white prefab container is the only concession around, rising from the sand with the bold geometric confidence of an Ed Ruscha gas station.","The beef patties are a little taller and juicier than the ones at Space Burgers. The pickles are outstanding. The fries, slender and golden, are sprinkled with pepper and salt. There is watermelon juice, fresh honey-ginger lemonade — “with electrolytes!” the chalkboard menu promises — and many flavors of Ocean Bomb, a sugary Taiwanese soda in cans decorated with portraits of Sailor Moon and her fellow Sailor Guardians. (Friday to Sunday, weather permitting, at least until Oct. 1.)Every bohemian beach town from Provincetown to Tulum needs a bohemian restaurant. In Rockaway Beach, that restaurant is Whit’s End. It has the cavernous, shadowy look of a roadhouse out on a country road, though it doesn’t have any beer lights. (Or any beer, for that matter.) Two oil paintings hang on the walls. Both are portraits of striped bass. This gives you a fair idea what you are in for.","Whitney Aycock, the chef and owner, leans heavily on seafood caught nearby. He cooks in broad strokes, with no regard at all for what’s stylish over in Manhattan. Slabs of local bluefin might be wrapped in crisp sushi rice and crisscrossed with spicy mayo. A super-smooth smoked bluefish dip, made with rivers of olive oil but no mayonnaise, comes with a Jenga stack of freshly baked crackers. The pot of clams is something to be reckoned with: chewy cherrystones and fried sticks of bread that you can soak in the pint or so of briny tomato sauce. There is pizza, too, from two wood-burning ovens. Just don’t ask for a slice — one of about two dozen rules and best practices on a page of the menu called “The Ways of Whit.” It’s enthusiastically profane; “We like dogs” is one of the few items that can be printed in its entirety in The Times. (Year round.)I won’t try to tell you that the beaches near the North Shore town of Port Washington, N.Y., are more beautiful than Cape Cod’s. They are not. I will tell you, though, that Port Washington has a clam shack that may be the equal of such revered Cape seafood palaces as Cobies, Moby Dick’s and the Kream ’N Kone. Butler’s Flat looks the part. It’s an unpainted shed on a Manhasset Bay pier where you order at the window, then look for a table next to the docks as sea gulls whine for scraps.The fried clams are fat and custardy under a crust that is less a helmet than a veil. If whole-belly clams, with their faintly bitter taste of organs, aren’t for you, the fried scallops, oysters and flounder are also archetypal. So is the lobster roll, an item that’s become more common in New York City than pastrami.","A more unusual treat is the stuffed quahog. Butler’s Flat bakes its stuffies in the Portuguese manner of New Bedford, Mass., flavoring the chopped clams and bread crumbs with garlic-scented bits of linguiça. The shack’s season ends in October, but about 20 miles south in Rockville Centre, Bigelow’s stays open all year, slinging seafood platters and chowder at its wraparound linoleum counter. A few yards away, eight lanes of traffic zoom along the Sunrise Highway, but Bigelow’s clams can make you hear the pounding surf. (Wednesday to Sunday, until Oct. 29.)Momofuku Ssam Bar’s impending closure was announced just two days after Fast Company published Joshua David Stein’s article about Marguerite Zabar Mariscal, Momofuku’s chief executive — who did not mention Ssam Bar. I wonder if Ms. Mariscal still maintains that her company’s restaurants “will always be the most experiential and complete way to experience Momofuku” now that she’s turning out the lights on the restaurant that used to served as a manifesto for the Momofuku lifestyle?Do shoppers who buy Momofuku Chili Crunch in their local Whole Foods care that the condiment is connected to actual places where you can sit down and have dinner? After all, the company that owns Rao’s pasta sauce recently sold for $2.7 billion to Campbell Soup, even though the percentage of supermarket customers who’ve been to the original Rao’s must be a very small number.","Read past editions of the newsletter here.","If you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others.

friend Larry McMurtry (all three men are Texans), he said to Daugherty: “Knowing Larry, it’s going to be a real episodic book.” Episodic this biography is. It’s also vastly entertaining.","McMurtry, the prolific author of “The Last Picture Show,” “Terms of Endearment” and “Lonesome Dove,” was a demythologizer of the American West who appeared to live in several registers at once.","On the one hand, this biography suggests that his life was rather deluxe. He was the American president of PEN, the literature and human rights group. He ate caviar at Petrossian with Susan Sontag. When Sontag was sick with cancer, he sent caviar to her bedside. He hunkered down for long stretches in a suite at the Pierre Hotel (when in New York) and at the Chateau Marmont (when in Los Angeles). He wrote for The New York Review of Books. He had intimate friendships with Diane Keaton and Cybill Shepherd; Shepherd has called him the love of her life. He attended his agent Swifty Lazar’s fabled Oscar night parties. He knew his way around Georgetown dinner parties, and even more so around rare books.","On the other hand, he’d grown up on a ranch.","  The ochre mud never entirely came off his boots, nor did he want it to. He wasn’t entirely comfortable on the coasts. He was a sloppy dresser; his belts tended to miss some loops. He loved Fritos, Dr Pepper, peanut patties and Hershey’s chocolate bars. He had a method with the Hershey’s bars. He liked them warm. He’d let them melt on his car’s dashboard while driving, then lick the goo off the wrapper. He could read and drive at the same time, he claimed, at least on the Texas plains. Once, stopped for speeding, he explained he’d been writing in his head and got excited. He was good at friendship. He liked gossip, dirty jokes and taking his slick Manhattan friends to stock car races.","The antic side of his personality means that Daugherty’s book, “Larry McMurtry: A Life,” reads a bit like one of McMurtry’s novels. Elegy and humor bleed into each other. This biography contains many sentences that verge on the humorous. For example: “He stalked the university corridors fiercely wielding his Ping-Pong paddle”; “The bacon cheeseburger had just been invented and we thought that was great”; “He lived in McMurtry’s pornography room”; “The main concern was finding good bars you wouldn’t get killed in”; and, about a poor movie made from one of his books, which he watched while sinking in his seat, “It’s not so bad if you only see the top half of the screen.”This is the first comprehensive biography of McMurtry, who died in 2021 at the age of 84. Daugherty is previously the author of biographies of Joseph Heller and Joan Didion, as well as the Texas writers Donald Barthelme and Billy Lee Brammer. He is the right person for this job, perhaps too much so. If his book has a fault, it’s that Daugherty tries to out-McMurtry McMurtry. His sentences get awfully loose and folksy (“a town no bigger than a gnat,” etc.), and this quality tempted me to sink in my own seat the way McMurtry did in that movie theater. I decided not to let it bother me, and you shouldn’t either, because he does everything else well.","He rakes his material into a story that has movement; he’s a good reader of the novels; he has an eye for anecdote and the telling quote; he builds toward extended set pieces, such as the filming of “The Last Picture Show” in Archer City, McMurtry’s hometown. (Half the locals loathed McMurtry for, in his semi-autobiographical novel, suggesting the town had so many dark secrets.) When McMurtry’s equally talented son, the musician James McMurtry, has a song lyric that suits the mood, this biographer knows how to tweezer it in. Daugherty also makes the point that McMurtry’s novels “had to be seen as one long stream.”He comprehensively covers McMurtry’s long career as a rare book dealer, both in Georgetown and in Archer City. McMurtry compared book collecting to ranching. “Instead of herding cattle,” booksellers herd books, he wrote. “Writing is a form of herding, too; I herd words into little paragraphlike clusters.”McMurtry was recognized, during his lifetime, as an important American writer. He won a Pulitzer Prize (for “Lonesome Dove”) and an Academy Award (for writing the “Brokeback Mountain” screenplay with his frequent collaborator Diana Ossana). He matters because of how closely he observed declining ways of life, and he intimately charted the national migration from rural to urban existence. But as he pointed out, in a letter to his friend Ken Kesey, the author of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” his books worked because of the attention paid to character:“For me the novel is character creation. Style is nice, plot is nice, structure is OK, social significance is OK, symbolism worms its way in, timeliness is OK too, but unless the characters convince and live the book’s got no chance.”McMurtry met Kesey when both were graduate students in the creative writing program that Wallace Stegner ran at Stanford University. Kesey arrived in 1958, McMurtry in 1960. They were competitive. But while McMurtry spent every morning writing (he averaged five to 10 pages a day, every day, his entire life), Kesey became increasingly interested in being a countercultural impresario. McMurtry barely drank and did not do drugs, but he did make an amusing cameo appearance in Tom Wolfe’s book “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” (1968), about Kesey’s road trip with his Merry Pranksters.","Women loved McMurtry, and he loved them back. He had a long string of female confidantes and sometimes lovers, and these were by and large serious relationships. Unlike James Dickey, who makes an appearance in this book with a stripper known as the Miami Hurricane, McMurtry was not a serial imbiber of groupies. He married twice, once early and once late. After his divorce from his first wife, Jo Ballard Scott, in 1966, they continued to see each other nearly every day and he paid for her classes at Rice University. They talked on the phone constantly. Scott said, “He was always the guy that drove everybody home.”Outside of his marriages, he tended to be intertwined with several women at once, none of whom, in this telling at any rate, has a bad word to say about him. These women included not just Keaton and Shepherd but the writer Leslie Marmon Silko and the journalist Maureen Orth, to whom he dedicated “Lonesome Dove.” McMurtry was always on the road, there but not there. “I had become a kind of Proust of the message machine,” says McMurtry’s alter-ego Danny Deck, in “Some Can Whistle” (a sequel to my favorite McMurtry novel, “All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers”), “leaving elegant, finely modulated monologues on the … machines of distinguished, or at least distinctive, women in New York, California.”The only thing that meant more to McMurtry than his relationships was his writing. This book is a study in vocation. Dave Hickey got the first word in this review. Let’s give him the last one, too:“Larry is a writer, and it’s kind of like being a critter. If you leave a cow alone, he’ll eat grass. If you leave Larry alone, he’ll write books.

an extraordinary look at an extraordinary ancient ecosystem.","The genetic material dates back at least two million years — that’s nearly twice as old as the mammoth DNA in Siberia that held the previous record. And the samples, described on Wednesday in the journal Nature, came from more than 135 different species.","Together, they show that a region just 600 miles from the North Pole was once covered by a forest of poplar and birch trees inhabited by mastodons. The forests were also home to caribou and Arctic hares. And the warm coastal waters were filled with horseshoe crabs, a species that today cannot be found any farther north of Maine.","Independent experts hailed the study as a major advance.","“It feels almost magical to be able to infer such a complete picture of an ancient ecosystem from tiny fragments of preserved DNA,” said Beth Shapiro, a paleogeneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.","“I think it’s going to blow people’s minds,” said Andrew Christ, a geoscientist at the University of Vermont who studies the ancient Arctic. “It certainly did so for me.”The discovery came after two decades of scientific gambles and frustrating setbacks.","One of the leaders of the project, Eske Willerslev, pioneered methods for pulling DNA out of sediment while he was a graduate student at the University of Copenhagen. In 2003, studying a chunk of Siberian permafrost, he and his colleagues found DNA from plants such as willow and daisies dating 400,000 years ago.","That discovery set a record for the oldest DNA, and many scientists doubted it would be possible to find anything much older. But in 2006, Dr. Willerslev and Kurt Kjaer, a geoscientist at the University of Copenhagen, tried to defy the odds in northern Greenland. They made their way to a geological formation called Kap Kobenhavn, a series of bare hills as desolate as a moonscape. Previously, scientists had found plant fossils there that they estimated to be 2.4 million years old. Finding DNA in the sediments would have been astonishing.","“If you want to move things forward, you need to take some leaps,” Dr. Kjaer said.","The researchers dug up permafrost and brought it back to Copenhagen to search for DNA. They failed to find any.","In later years, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues had more success when they examined younger sediments and bones from other parts of the world. They discovered a wealth of ancient human DNA that has helped reshape our understanding of our species’ history.","Along the way, the researchers tweaked their methods for extracting DNA from ancient samples and upgraded the machines they used to sequence it. As they became better at fishing for genes, they would take out more of the Kap Kobenhavn samples for another shot.","But for years they failed, again and again. From time to time they were tantalized by what looked like short bits of DNA, which are called reads. The researchers couldn’t rule out the possibility that bits of young DNA in Greenland, or even in their lab, had contaminated the reads.","Finally, after a major upgrade in their technology, they found DNA in the samples in 2017. The permafrost turned out to be loaded with genetic material. Before long they had collected millions of DNA fragments.","“It was a breakthrough,” Dr. Willerslev said. “It was going from nothing or very little that you don’t know is real, to suddenly: It’s there.”The researchers lined up the fragments with DNA sequences of living species to figure out where they belonged on the evolutionary tree. They found 102 different kinds of plants — including 78 that had previously been identified from fossils and 24 new ones. The plant DNA painted a picture of forests dominated by poplar and birch trees.","Other sequences come from land animals, including caribou, hares, mastodons, geese, lemmings and ants. The researchers also found marine species, such as horseshoe crabs, corals and algae.","“It superseded everything we imagined,” Dr. Kjaer said.","The researchers also searched the permafrost for new clues to the age of the fossils. They found layers in the sediment in which the minerals revealed that the Earth’s magnetic field had flipped. The age of those reversals helped the researchers determine that Kap Kobenhavn was at least two million years old, but they could not establish a clear upper limit. “My gut feeling as a geoscientist is that it’s older,” Dr. Kjaer said.","The researchers ruled out the possibility that the DNA came from younger species that contaminated the older permafrost. The DNA of the birch trees lacked many of the mutations that living species have, indicating that they were ancient. The DNA also had a distinct pattern of damage that occurs only when the molecules have been sitting in sediment for geological stretches of time.","“It really helps show that this really is old DNA,” said Tyler Murchie, a postdoctoral researcher at McMaster University who was not involved in the new study.","The researchers were surprised by some of the species they found. Caribou live today in Greenland, as they do across much of the Arctic. But until now, their fossil record suggested they evolved a million years ago. Their DNA now doubles their evolutionary history.","Love Dalén, a paleogeneticist from Stockholm University who last year discovered mammoth DNA in Siberia that was 1.2 million years old, marveled that mastodons turned up in Greenland. “What the hell are they doing up there?” he asked.","Dr. Dalén noted that the nearest known mastodon fossils were 75,000-year-old remains in Nova Scotia — which are far younger than the Greenland DNA, and much farther south than Kap Kobenhavn. “You can’t go much further north on dry land,” he said.","The Danish researchers determined that the mastodons in Greenland two million years ago belonged to a deep branch of the mastodon family tree, one that was previously unknown. “That could mean they are the ancestors of the late-Pleistocene mastodons that we know of, or that they could represent a new species,” Dr. Dalén said.","Ecologically, mastodons would fit in well in a poplar-birch forest in Greenland, as they did in North American woodlands. While caribou are most common on northern tundras, a subspecies lives in Canadian forests, offering clues to how the ancient caribou might have thrived. But the presence of horseshoe crabs in the shallow coastal waters suggests that the ocean and land alike were remarkably warm.","Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues are continuing to study the DNA for clues to how all these species were able to thrive a thousand miles north of the Arctic Circle. The trees, for example, had to survive half the year in darkness. The DNA preserved for two million years may hold their secrets of adaptation.","The scientists are also interested in how the DNA fragments managed to survive so long and defy expectations. Their research indicates that the DNA molecules can cling to minerals of feldspar and clay, which protect them from further damage.","Based on that discovery, the researchers are developing new methods that they hope will let them pull even more DNA out of ancient sediments. Dr. Kjaer and his colleagues are scouting four-million-year-old sites in Canada with the hope of breaking their own record.","Dr. Dalén said they might succeed. But the damage that both he and the Danish researchers are finding in the oldest DNA suggests to him that it will be impossible to find ancient genetic material older than about five million years. “This in no way suggests that there will be any DNA coming out of dinosaur-aged fossils,” he said.","Dr. Christ said that finding more DNA may help them better understand how human-driven climate change will alter the Arctic. We should not assume, he said, that the region will resemble ecosystems in places farther south. After all, the ecosystem of Kap Kobenhavn two million years ago has no analog today.","“Life will adapt, but in ways we don’t expect,” Dr. Christ said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/science/oldest-dna-greenland-species.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/07/multimedia/07greenland-1-e98e/07greenland-1-e98e-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2022-12-07 16:00:10+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:51.723754+00');

deep history of Europe from the bones of ancient hunter-gatherers and the iconic art they left behind, like cave paintings, fertility figurines and “lion-man” statues.","Over the past decade, geneticists have added a new dimension to that history by extracting DNA from teeth and bones.","And now, in a pair of studies published on Wednesday‌, researchers have produced the most robust analysis yet of the genetic record of prehistoric Europe.","Looking at DNA gleaned from the remains of 357 ancient Europeans, researchers discovered that several waves of hunter-gatherers migrated into Europe. The studies identified at least eight populations, some more genetically distinct from each other than modern-day Europeans and Asians. They coexisted in Europe for thousands of years, apparently trading tools and sharing cultures. Some groups survived the Ice Age, while others vanished, perhaps wiped out by other groups.","“We are finally understanding the dynamics of European hunter-gatherers,” said Vanessa Villalba-Mouco, a paleogeneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and an author of both studies.","The new genetic analysis suggests that when farmers arrived in Europe about 8,000 years ago, they encountered the descendants of this long history, with light-skinned, dark-eyed people to the east, and possibly dark-skinned and blue-eyed people to the west.","Dr. Villalba-Mouco and her colleagues have given these peoples a list of new names that can be as hard to memorize as the kingdoms of Westeros: the Fournol, the Vestonice, the GoyetQ2, the Villabruna, the Oberkassel and the Sidelkino, among others.","But the scientists are only just beginning to understand how so many different groups emerged 45,000 to 5,000 years ago.","“I didn’t expect these amounts of replacements and changes in ancestry,” said Carles Lalueza-Fox, the director of the Natural Sciences Museum in Barcelona and an author of one of the new papers. “We lack still an understanding of why these movements were triggered. What happened here, why it happened — it’s strange.”Modern humans arose in Africa and expanded to other continents about 60,000 years ago. Last year, archaeologists reported what might be the oldest evidence of those humans reaching Europe: a set of 54,000-year-old teeth in a French cave.","When these groups arrived in Europe, Neanderthals had already been living across the continent for more than 100,000 years. The Neanderthals disappeared about 40,000 years ago, perhaps because modern humans outcompeted them with superior tools.","But the oldest DNA of modern humans in Europe, dating back 45,000 years, undermines such a simple story. It comes from people who belonged to a lost branch of the human family tree. Their ancestors were part of the expansion out of Africa, but they split off on their own before the ancestors of living Europeans and Asians split apart.","These early Europeans have almost no genetic link to younger remains of hunter-gatherers. It appears that the first modern humans in Europe may have disappeared along with the Neanderthals, said Cosimo Posth, a paleogeneticist at the University of Tübingen in Germany and an author on the two papers published Wednesday.","“It’s actually quite interesting that the very first modern humans also had a very hard time to actually survive,” Dr. Posth said.","Before the advent of ancient DNA analysis, archaeologists would give names to cultures based on the styles of the things they made. The oldest modern human culture in Europe is known as the Aurignacians, named for the continent’s oldest figurative cave paintings and sculptures.","About 33,000 years ago, as the climate turned cold, a new culture called the Gravettian arose across Europe. Gravettian hunters made spears to kill woolly mammoths and other big game. They also made so-called Venus figurines that might have represented fertility.","Dr. Posth and his colleagues found DNA in Gravettian remains scattered across Europe. The scientists had expected all of the individuals to have come from the same genetic population, but instead found two distinct groups: one in France and Spain, and another in Italy, the Czech Republic and Germany.","“They were very distinct, and this was a very big surprise to us because they practiced the same archaeological culture,” Dr. Posth said.","Dr. Posth and his colleagues named the western population the Fournol people, and found a genetic link between this group and 35,000-year-old Aurignacian remains in Belgium.","They called the eastern group Vestonice, and discovered that they share an ancestry with 34,000-year-old hunter-gatherers who lived in Russia.","That genetic gulf led Dr. Posth and his colleagues to argue that the Fournol and Vestonice belonged to two waves that migrated into Europe separately. After they arrived, they lived for several thousand years sharing the Gravettian culture but remaining genetically distinct.","“This result is, in my opinion, groundbreaking,” said Anaïs Luiza Vignoles, an archaeologist at the University of Paris who was not involved in the study.","Dr. Vingoles said that archaeologists could now investigate the kind of cultural contacts these two populations had. It’s clear from the new study that they were not isolated entirely from each other. In Belgium, the scientists found 30,000-year-old remains with a mix of Fournol and Vestonice ancestry.","Jüergen Richter, an archaeologist at the University of Cologne who was not involved in the new studies, suggested that in these sporadic contacts between the two peoples, they might have shared cultural ideas and artifacts like fertility figuring. “I’m absolutely not surprised,” he said of the new findings.","About 26,000 years ago, the two groups faced a new threat to their survival: an advancing wall of glaciers. During the Ice Age, from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago, European hunter-gatherers were shut out of much of the continent, surviving only in southern refuges.","Dr. Villalba-Mouco and her colleagues shed light on the refuge of the Iberian Peninsula, the region now occupied by Spain and Portugal, by studying DNA in the teeth of a 23,000-year-old man found in a cave in southern Spain. His DNA revealed that he belonged to the Fournol people who lived in Iberia before the Ice Age. The researchers also found genetic markers linking him to a 45,000-year-old skeleton discovered in Bulgaria.","When the glaciers retreated, some descendants of the Fournol continued living in Iberia. But others expanded north as a new population, which Dr. Posth and his colleagues called GoyetQ2. “It really seems like a peopling of Europe after the last glacial maximum,” he said.","The Vestonice, by contrast, did not survive the Ice Age. When the glaciers were at their most expansive, the Vestonice may have endured for a time in Italy. But Dr. Posth and his colleagues found no Vestonice ancestry in Europeans after the Ice Age. Instead, they discovered a population of hunter-gatherers that appeared to have expanded from the Balkans, known as the Villabruna. They moved into Italy and replaced the Vestonice.","For several thousand years, the Villabruna were limited to southern Europe. Then, 14,000 years ago, they crossed the Alps and encountered the GoyetQ2 people to the north. A new population emerged, its ancestry three parts Villabruna to one part GoyetQ2.","This new people, which Dr. Posth and his colleagues called Oberkassel, expanded across much of Europe, replacing the old GoyetQ2 population.","Dr. Posth speculated that another climate shift could explain this new wave. About 14,000 years ago, a pulse of strong warming produced forests across much of Europe. The Oberkassel people may have been better at hunting in forests, whereas the GoyetQ2 retreated with the shrinking steppes.","To the east, the Oberkassel ran into a new group of hunter-gatherers, who probably arrived from Russia. The scientists named this group’s descendants, who lived in Ukraine and surrounding regions, the Sidelkino.","But in Iberia, there were no great sweeps of newcomers replacing older peoples. The Iberians after the Ice Age still carried a great deal of ancestry from the Fournol people who had arrived there thousands of years before the glaciers advanced. The Villabruna people moved into northern Spain, but added their DNA to the mix rather than replacing those who were there before.","When the first farmers arrived in Europe from Turkey about 8,000 years ago, three large groups of hunter-gatherers thrived across Europe: the Iberians, the Oberkassel and the Sidelkino. Living Europeans carry some of their genes, which allowed Dr. Posth and his colleagues to make some educated guesses about the physical appearances of the ancient populations.","The Sidelkino people in the east had genes associated with dark eyes and light skin. The Oberkassel in the west, in contrast, probably had blue eyes and may have had dark skin, although it’s harder to be sure of their appearance than the Sidelkino.","These three groups of hunter-gatherers remained isolated from each other for about 6,000 years, until the farmers from Turkey arrived. After this advent of agriculture, the three groups began mixing, the scientists found. It’s possible that the spread of farmland forced them to move to the margins of Europe to survive. But over time, they were absorbed into the agricultural communities that surrounded them.","Ludovic Orlando, a molecular archaeologist at Paul Sabatier University in France who was not involved in the new research, said that it was a milestone in the study of early humans. “I was really blown away,” he said.","Dr. Orlando said that every continent will likely have its own history of hunter-gatherer migrations. Researchers were able to plumb Europe’s history in such great detail because they could take advantage of 150 years’ worth of remains that have been stored in museums there.","But he predicted that scientists won’t have to dig up a lot of new skeletons on other continents to reconstruct their genetic histories. That’s because it is now possible to extract human DNA from cave sediments rather than searching for bones and teeth.","“We cannot develop a Eurocentric vision of the past,” Dr. Orlando said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/science/dna-hunter-gatherers-europe.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/07/multimedia/01sci-hunters-01-fkcv/01sci-hunters-01-fkcv-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-03-01 16:00:11+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:52.733748+00');

The global inventory is made up of 1.1 billion objects that range from dinosaur skulls to pollen grains to mosquitoes.","The survey’s organizers, who described the effort in the journal Science, said they hoped the survey would help museums join forces to answer pressing questions, such as how quickly species are becoming extinct and how climate change is altering the natural world.","“It gives us intelligence now to start thinking about things that museums can do together that we wouldn’t have conceived of before,” said Kirk Johnson, the director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington and one of the leaders of the project. “It’s the argument for networking the global museum.”Scientists had created smaller inventory databases before. But the new effort, which included 73 museums in 28 countries, was unparalleled, experts said.","“The analysis is at a global scale that no one else has managed,” said Emily Meineke, an entomologist at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the survey.","The survey revealed important gaps in the world’s collections. Relatively few objects come from the regions around the earth’s poles, which are especially vulnerable to the impact of global warming, for example. Insects, the most diverse group of animal species, were also underrepresented.","Dr. Meineke said that this survey of large institutions also laid the groundwork for surveys of smaller ones, which might hold even more surprises. “Once these methods are applied down the line to smaller collections, the results are likely to give us a truer picture of biodiversity globally,” she said.","Natural history museums got their start in the 1400s as cabinets of wonders in which aristocrats kept precious oddities like narwhal skulls or glittering crystals. By the 19th century, they had become national institutions that employed cadres of full-time curators.","When the museum gained a new object in those early days, curators would typically scrawl down some basic information about it on a paper slip. That slip might then get tucked into a box of pinned butterflies, or dropped into a jar holding a preserved shark. Curators would then store the box or the jar in a cabinet and make a note of it in a ledger.","Today, natural museums have amassed vast collections. The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History alone holds 148,033,146 objects. In recent years, some museums have been putting their objects online.","Last year, for example, the U.S. National Herbarium finished uploading photos of nearly four million pressed plants. But most objects in natural history museums have yet to be scanned and uploaded to the cloud — or even recorded in an online catalog.","With only a rough idea of what was in their own collections, Dr. Johnson and fellow museum directors recognized that they had an even murkier understanding of what they shared collectively.","“It occurred to us that we each hold these amazing assets, but we don’t have a way to compare them,” he said. “We realized that we were presiding over these kingdoms of dark data.”Rather than wait for years until they had all digitized their collections, the museum directors wanted to take stock now. They asked their curators to fill out a survey describing what kind of collections they housed in their museums — plants, fungi, fossils, and so on. They then estimated how big each collection was, sometimes simply by counting cabinets, and where scientists had gone to collect the objects they contained.","The curators also provided the number of objects that had been digitized, how many had been sampled for DNA and how many people had studied different groups of species at each museum. The museums created an online dashboard to explore the survey’s results.","“This is the realization of a dream I and other people in my role have had for many years,” said Michael Novacek, the senior vice president of science at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.","Dr. Johnson said it was surprising just how many scientists study mammals compared with other species. “The pull of the warm fuzzy things was pretty apparent in the numbers,” he said.","By contrast, only 10 percent of the museum scientists studied insects. “This is kind of a deficit,” Dr. Johnson said. “Insects are the biggest component of terrestrial biodiversity, and also huge pollinators and vectors of disease.”Museums have done relatively little collecting in the Arctic or Antarctica, two regions that are getting hit especially hard by global warming. Dr. Novacek said that it is important for museums to have a record of the diversity of life there to understand how it is changing with rising temperatures. “It’s a call to action,” he said.","Knowing what is missing from the world’s museums could help them plan new expeditions that can fill in the gaps. “We might be able to make a collecting plan for the 21st century,” Dr. Johnson said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/science/science-museums-online-collections.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/28/multimedia/23SCI-MUSEUMS-04-ghcl/23SCI-MUSEUMS-04-ghcl-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-03-23 18:00:10+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:53.013724+00');

Carl Zimmer', 'science', '["One of the greatest transformations in the history of life occurred more than 600 million years ago, when a single-celled organism gave rise to the first animals. With their multicellular bodies, animals evolved into a staggering range of forms, like whales that weigh 200 tons, birds that soar six miles into the sky and sidewinders that slither across desert dunes.","Scientists have long wondered what the first animals were like, including questions about their anatomy and how they found food. In a study published on Wednesday, scientists found tantalizing answers in a little-known group of gelatinous creatures called comb jellies. While the first animals remain a mystery, scientists found that comb jellies belong to the deepest branch on the animal family tree.","The debate over the origin of animals has endured for decades. At first, researchers relied largely on the fossil record for clues. The oldest definitive animal fossils date back about 580 million years, although some researchers have claimed to find even older ones. In 2021, for example, Elizabeth Turner, a Canadian paleontologist, reported finding 890-million-year-old fossils of possible sponges.","Sponges would make sense as the oldest animal. They are simple creatures, with no muscles or nervous system. They anchor themselves to the ocean floor, where they filter water through a maze of pores, trapping bits of food.","Sponges are so simple, in fact, that it can come as a surprise that they are animals at all, but their molecular makeup reveals their kinship. They make certain proteins, such as collagen, that are produced only by animals. What’s more, their DNA shows they are more closely related to animals than to other forms of life.","Starting in the 1990s, as scientists gathered DNA from more animal species, they tried to draw the animal family tree. In some studies, the sponges ended up on the deepest branch of the tree. In this scenario, animals evolved a nervous system only after the sponges branched off.","But in the early 2000s, other scientists came to a surprisingly different conclusion. They found that the deepest branch of animals were comb jellies — slim, oval creatures that often grow a distinctive set of iridescent bands that flicker in the darkness of the deep ocean.","Many experts were reluctant to accept that conclusion, because it meant animal evolution was weirder than they had realized. For one thing, comb jellies were not as simple as sponges. They have a nervous system: A web of neurons circling their bodies controls their muscles.","To resolve the comb-jelly-versus-sponge debate, researchers from around the world collected DNA from more species of ocean animals. And instead of looking at single genes, researchers figured out how to sequence entire genomes.","But the avalanche of new data failed to settle the debate. Some scientists ended up assembling a tree in which sponges were the deepest branch, while others ended up with comb jellies.","The new study, published in the journal Nature, relied on a new method for using DNA to track animal evolution.","In previous studies, scientists looked at how certain mutations arise in different animal branches. A mutation may cause a single genetic letter, known as a base, to switch to a different letter. That mutation will then be inherited by an animal’s descendants.","But these mutations can be unreliable markers of history. A base may switch from one letter to another, and then millions of years later, it may switch back to the original one. Alternatively, the same base may switch to the same letter in two unrelated lineages. That parallel evolution creates the illusion that the two lineages are closely related.","In the new study, Darrin Schultz, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Vienna, and his colleagues looked instead at a different kind of genetic change. On rare occasion, a huge chunk of DNA will get accidentally moved from one chromosome to another.","This massive mutation is less likely to deceive scientists. The odds that precisely the same chunk of DNA moves to precisely the same location a second time is astronomically low. It’s also next to impossible for that chunk to move back to exactly the spot from which it came.","“It’s direct evidence of something that happened,” Dr. Schultz said.","His team tracked the movements of genetic material in the chromosomes of nine animals, along with three single-celled relatives of animals. They found a number of chunks of DNA in precisely the same spot in the genomes of sponges and other animals. But these chunks were in a different position in comb jellies and single-celled relatives of animals. That finding led Dr. Schultz and his colleagues to conclude that comb jellies split off from other animals first.","“It’s a fresh look with a fresh approach to the question,” said Antonis Rokas, an evolutionary biologist at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study.","In a 2021 study, Dr. Rokas and his colleagues also came down in favor of comb jellies. He said the new analysis provided a strong confirmation.","“I’ve learned not to ever say the debate is over,” Dr. Rokas said. “But this moves the needle.”The study raises intriguing new possibilities for what the common ancestor of living animals looked like. If comb jellies, with a nervous system and muscles, are the deepest branch on the animal tree, then early animals may have not been simple and spongelike. They had nervous systems and muscles too. Only later did sponges abandon their nervous system.","Dr. Schultz cautioned against thinking of comb jellies as living fossils, unchanged since the dawn of animals. “Something that’s alive today can’t be the ancestor of something alive today,” he said.","Instead, researchers are looking now to comb jellies to see how similar and different their nervous systems are from those of other animals. Recently, Maike Kittelmann, a cell biologist at Oxford Brookes University, and her colleagues froze comb jelly larvae so that they could get a microscopic look at their nervous system. What they saw left them baffled.","Throughout the animal kingdom, neurons are typically separated from one another by tiny gaps called synapses. They can communicate across the gap by releasing chemicals.","But when Dr. Kittelmann and her colleagues started to inspect the comb jelly neurons, they struggled to find a synapse between the neurons. “At that point, we were like, ‘This is curious,’” she said.","In the end, they failed to find any synapses between them. Instead, the comb jelly nervous system forms one continuous web.","When Dr. Kittelmann and her colleagues reported their findings last month, they speculated yet another possibility for the origin of animals. Comb jellies may have evolved their own weird nervous system independently of other animals, using some of the same building blocks.","Dr. Kittelmann and her colleagues are now inspecting other species of comb jellies to see if that idea holds up. But they won’t be surprised to be surprised again. “You have to assume nothing,” she said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/17/science/first-animals-comb-jellies.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/05/30/autossell/17sci-jellies-vidcover/17sci-jellies-vidcover-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-05-17 15:00:10+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:54.062759+00');

It may have been looking for a meal, escaping a predator or seeking a shady place to rest. Later, like anyone who has ascended high into a forest’s canopy, our relative discovered that getting down in one piece is less simple than it seems.","Although that ancestral primate must have solved the problem, scientists have a lot of work to do in understanding how what went up first managed to come down, and how it relates to the evolution of our species.","“Everyone focuses on climbing up, because that’s a difficult thing to do. Any human can relate to this, like climbing up a fireman’s pole, for example, is challenging,” said Nathaniel Dominy, an evolutionary biologist at Dartmouth. “No one bothered to study climbing down, because gravity doesn’t care whether you’re climbing up or down.”In a study published Wednesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Dr. Dominy and colleagues found that apes and our ancient human ancestors probably developed flexible shoulder and elbow joints to counteract the effects of gravity on their larger bodies, a sort of braking system to finely control their descent from trees. The researchers posit that this adaptation persisted even as early humans swapped out trees for grassland habitats, their versatile upper limbs now making it possible to forage, hunt and defend.","The finding may shed light on the incremental steps in evolution that led to human ancestors walking upright, freeing hands for crafting and carrying tools.","A key insight came from Mary Joy, a co-author of the study and at the time a Dartmouth undergraduate. She had been watching videos of chimpanzees, which are human’s closest living relatives, and sooty mangabeys, an Old World monkey native to West and Central Africa. The footage had been collected by two other authors of the study, Luke Fannin, a graduate student, and Jeremy DeSilva, a paleoanthropology professor at Dartmouth.","Ms. Joy noticed that both animals climbed up trees with the same effort. The downward climb, however, was different.","Employing software typically used to analyze the movements of human athletes, Ms. Joy saw that when chimpanzees climbed down a tree, they extended their shoulders and elbows above their heads to a far greater degree than the smaller monkeys. Compared to the sooty mangabeys, the chimps flexed their shoulders about 14 degrees more, and extended their elbows about 34 degrees more, when climbing down (versus up) a tree.","“The mangabeys had a sort of similar motion to how they climbed up, a pretty angled way to hold their arms,” Ms. Joy said. For the chimps, it was like they were in a controlled fall, while also using a full range of motion to go as quickly as possible.","This freer range of motion matched what scientists already know about the anatomical variations between chimpanzees and mangabeys, something the researchers double-checked by looking at skeletal samples. Apes, Dr. DeSilva explained, have shoulder joints shaped roughly like a ball and socket, compared to the more pear-shaped joints in monkeys. Additionally, elbow joints in apes open more widely. Together, these things allow a greater range of motion.","Humans bear similar shoulder and elbow anatomies to chimps, Dr. DeSilva said, as did ancient hominins like Ardipithecus and Australopithecus. Dr. Dominy estimates the emergence of this adaptation to 15 to 20 million years ago.","Susan Larson, a professor of anatomical sciences at Stony Brook University in New York, who was not involved in the study, likened the new findings to a missing puzzle piece scientists have sought tirelessly, offering critical insight into the hominid evolution from trees to land.","“Climbing up and down trees is very important if you’re going to escape predators and exploit resources,” Dr. Larson said. “I think it does give us a way of thinking about why early humans would retain these features for a long time, until they sort of abandoned trees and became bipedal hunters.”The researchers hope to corroborate their findings in other, larger simians.","“There are large monkeys like mandrills and baboons that will climb trees occasionally,” Dr. Dominy said. “It would be nice to see how bigger monkeys handle ‘downclimbing.’”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/science/chimpanzees-trees-evolution.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/12/multimedia/06tb-ape-arms-01-chfk/06tb-ape-arms-01-chfk-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-06 18:29:10+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:54.353788+00');

bull sharks.","It all started in 1996 when raging floods swept six young bull sharks from a nearby river into a 51-acre lake near the golf course’s 14th hole. When the floodwaters receded, the sharks found themselves stuck, surrounded by grassy hills and curious golfers.","The sharks spent 17 years in the lake, sustaining themselves on its large stock of fish and on the occasional meat treat provided by the club’s staff. One shark was illegally fished out, while the others vanished after subsequent floods.","The sharks, according to a new study, are more than just a fluke along the fairway. In research published last month in the journal Marine and Fisheries Science, Peter Gausmann, a shark scientist and lecturer at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, said that the cartilaginous club members of Carbrook demonstrate that bull sharks can live indefinitely in low-salinity aquatic environments.","Bull sharks can be found in warm coastal waters the world over. These stout sharks can reach 11 to 13 feet in length and weigh upward of 500 pounds. They are one of the few shark species that can tolerate a wide range of salinities, a trait that allows them to venture into freshwater and brackish habitats such as rivers, estuaries and lagoons.","Unfortunately, this impressive adaptation often puts the sharks in close quarters with humans, one of the many reasons bull sharks are responsible for dozens of documented fatal attacks on humans.","If most sharks were to enter a freshwater environment, their internal salt levels would become diluted and they would die. But bull sharks have specially adapted kidneys and rectal glands that work together to recycle and retain the salt in their bodies.","Freshwater and brackish habitats provide young bull sharks a place to grow up without the threat of predation from larger sharks. Once they’ve reached maturity, however, bull sharks usually head to the sea, where larger prey and breeding opportunities abound. That the Carbrook shark population did not grow during their time in the golf course offered further evidence that the species prefers to breed in saltier environments.","While scientists have long known that bull sharks have the means to move between fresh and saltwater environments, no one knows if these sharks could spend their entire lives in freshwater.","Research suggests bull sharks can live about 30 years, and the Carbrook group survived in the golf course’s lake for 17 years. That suggests there is “no upper limit” to how long these sharks can spend in low-salinity environments, said Vincent Raoult, a postdoctoral researcher at Deakin University in Australia who was not involved in the new study.","“I think a lot of people would be scared to learn there could be bull sharks in their local pond, but the fact is, it’s pretty amazing that there are animals that are able to do this,” Dr. Raoult said.","While the idea of sharing a lake with bull sharks may be scary to some, the golfers relished the opportunity, Scott Wagstaff, general manager of Carbrook Golf Club, said.","“Every single member here just loves the sharks,” Mr. Wagstaff said.","When the sharks were still around, he and other staff would toss chunks of meat into the water and marvel at the way the sharks devoured the food with their fearsome maws. “I’ve seen them jump completely out of the water and spin as they land. It was pretty cool,” Mr. Wagstaff said.","Extreme floods like the ones that washed sharks in and out of Carbrook Golf Club are becoming more common, and more bull sharks could end up marooned in lakes, lagoons and ponds. Although you are highly unlikely to encounter a bull shark in your local swimming hole, Dr. Gausmann recommends avoiding bodies of water recently affected by flooding.","“You should never bathe in stagnant bodies of water that once had a connection to the sea. You never know if sharks are living there,” he said, although people in urban areas may not need to worry, as urban floodwaters are often too toxic to sustain marine life.","And there is another lesson to take away, as shark sightings and occasional attacks on human swimmers prompt fearful reactions in some places.","“If this paper has shown anything, it is that it is possible to live side by side with sharks,” Leonardo Guida, a shark scientist with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/science/sharks-golf-course-australia.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/12tb-sharktrap-mlhz/12tb-sharktrap-mlhz-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-12 04:00:13+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:54.967723+00');

apocalyptic. Tsunamis washed away coastlines, raging fires engulfed forests and dust and debris blotted out the sun for months. Roughly three-fourths of the planet’s species, most notably non-avian dinosaurs, were wiped out.","But one group appears to have weathered the maelstrom. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters, researchers present evidence that flowering plants survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene, or K-Pg, mass extinction relatively unscathed compared with other living things on Earth at the time. The catastrophe may have even helped flowering plants blossom into the dominant green things they are today.","“It’s just bizarre to think that flowering plants survived K-Pg when dinosaurs didn’t,” said Jamie Thompson, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Bath and one of the authors of the study.","Flowering plants are known to scientists as angiosperms. They originated in the early Cretaceous, and were often overshadowed by older groups like conifers and ferns. But they rapidly diversified as mass extinction loomed.","To determine how flowering plants fared during the K-Pg extinction event, Dr. Thompson teamed up with Santiago Ramírez-Barahona, an evolutionary geneticist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The pair were initially hindered by a lack of fossil flowers, which are scarce compared with fossilized bones. Some of the largest angiosperm lineages today, like orchids, barely show up in the fossil record.","To uncover the evolutionary insights missing from the fossil record, the researchers analyzed two evolutionary trees containing more than 100,000 species of living angiosperms. These sprawling data sets, known as phylogenies, were calibrated using molecular clues that allow scientists to group related species together and determine when certain lineages diverged. Together, the phylogenies lay out an evolutionary timeline of when the ancestors of modern angiosperm lineages emerged and when they died out.","The researchers discovered something surprising. While many angiosperm species died out with the dinosaurs, pterosaurs and marine reptiles — especially those living near the asteroid impact crater — the larger lineages of flowering plants survived the extinction event and exhibited a relatively constant rate of extinction through time.","“I think that is actually in perfect step with the plant fossil record,” said Paige Wilson Deibel, a paleobotanist at the Burke Museum in Seattle who studies fossils from the K-Pg boundary in northeastern Montana and was not involved in the new study. “There is really high species-level extinction but the major lineages all seem to have survived.”This contrasts starkly with the evolutionary tree of dinosaurs. “Non-avian dinosaurs lost so many species, they lost entire lineages, which we don’t see in angiosperms,” Dr. Thompson said.","While more work is needed to determine how angiosperms survived one of the deadliest extinctions in Earth’s history, the researchers posit that their adaptability played a role. Because flowering plants are pollinated by both insects and wind, they have significant reproductive flexibility. Their vast diversity — by the end of the Cretaceous, grasses, sycamore and magnolia trees, and aquatic waterlilies had all appeared — may have also helped them survive the devastation.","As Earth’s climate stabilized and life recovered, flowering plants took over terrestrial ecosystems. In 2021, researchers comparing Colombian fossils from before and after the K-Pg boundary found that the extinction allowed angiosperms to dominate. This led to the first rainforests, which remain hotbeds of flowering plant diversity.","Dr. Ramírez-Barahona said this trend likely occurred in ancient ecosystems worldwide. “Before and after the K-Pg impact the whole ecological composition changed,” he said. “They restructured themselves into these new flowering ecosystems.” Today, nearly 80 percent of all terrestrial plants are angiosperms.","In this way the impact that doomed the dinosaurs gave rise to modern ecosystems. Instead of giant reptiles, these habitats were populated by mammals, who had persisted through the mass extinction along with flowering plants and were primed for a similar explosion in diversity.","After the K-Pg boundary, “we’re starting to see plants and animals that we recognize,” Dr. Wilson Deibel said. “It’s in this really dynamic time of giant environmental disasters and mass extinctions that the environment becomes analogous to what we see today.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/science/flowers-dinosaurs-extinction.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/science/12tb-flowers/12tb-flowers-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-12 23:01:07+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:55.433719+00');

'By Darren Incorvaia', 'science', '["John Pogonoski, an ichthyologist in Australia, wasn’t about to be fooled by any moray eels. He knew the serpentine fish like to hide among the nooks and crannies of large sponges. But as he surveyed sponges collected from a remote seabed off the coast of Western Australia, he stumbled on a complete surprise — a small shark tail poking out of a sponge’s cavernous body.","The errant tail belonged to Atelomycterus fasciatus, better known as a banded sand catshark. And it wasn’t alone. Mr. Pogonoski, who works at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or CSIRO, and colleagues found as many as 30 of the petite predators packed into just one sponge. The discovery, reported in the Journal of Fish Biology, is the first record of any shark using the inside of a sponge as a habitat.","“We see sharks in small caves, we see sharks hiding within crevices in coral reefs,” said David Shiffman, a shark biologist and faculty research associate at Arizona State University who was not involved in the study. “Sponges, though, this is new.”The word “shark” may conjure images of gargantuan great whites or hefty hammerheads. But the cartilaginous carnivores come in many sizes. The banded sand catshark, maxing out around a foot and a half in length, is on the smaller end of the spectrum.","“This small size makes them quite vulnerable to predation by larger sharks and fish,” said Helen O’Neill, a fish biologist at CSIRO’s Australian National Fish Collection in Tasmania and an author of the paper. At night the catsharks prowl the seafloor for prey, but Ms. O’Neill suspects that during the day “they are hiding safely within the sponges” to avoid becoming food themselves.","The sponge-burrowing turned out to be a popular activity. After Mr. Pogonoski’s fortuitous find, the researchers ultimately discovered 57 catsharks in two kinds of sponge. The sharks were male, female, young, old; hiding in sponges seems to be fun the whole family can enjoy. Because other shark species are known to lay their eggs on the outside of sponges, Dr. Shiffman said it’s possible the catsharks are using the porous, living dwellings to raise their families. “Animals are always looking for ways to protect their babies,” he said.","Another question is whether the sponges get anything in return by renting space to the sharks.","“More investigation would be needed to assess whether the sponge would benefit from the sharks’ presence,” Ms. O’Neill said. She theorizes that the sharks could potentially be eating small fish or invertebrates that would otherwise snack on the sponge. “Security guard for the hotel,” she said with a wink.","This was an opportunistic observation, so much remains unknown about what the sharks are doing inside the sponges and why. “No one was observing the sharks go into there, or how long they’re in there, or what they’re doing,” Dr. Shiffman said. The unexpected nature of this discovery also means that there’s no follow-up work currently planned, Ms. O’Neill said, but “we will certainly be keeping our eyes peeled on future voyages.”There are more than 530 species of shark, many as small as the banded sand catshark, so it’s likely that others are spending time inside sponges, too. And given how poorly understood the banded sand catshark is, who knows what else it — and other species — could be getting up to.","“Sharks are not a one-dimensional thing,” Dr. Shiffman said. “They come in every shape and size and color that you can imagine. They have all sorts of weird behaviors, and we’re still learning new things about them.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/science/sponges-sharks.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/14tb-sponge-sharks-tvhz/14tb-sponge-sharks-tvhz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg', '2023-09-14 04:00:21+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:55.961951+00');

'["Industrial-scale whaling in the 19th and 20th centuries nearly drove many whale species into extinction. Populations of some of the large marine mammals are just starting to recover after the kind of predation described in the novel “Moby-Dick,” while others face ongoing peril to their existence. But it turns out that whaling’s effects on where whales live go back much deeper into human history.","A new analysis of ancient whale bones, published Wednesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science, suggests that medieval European hunting may have played a role in some whales disappearing from northeast Atlantic waters long before Captain Ahab, Ishmael and the Pequod sought their great white whale.","As early as 8,000 years ago, humans carved their attempts to capture whales into South Korean cliffs. More recently, medieval texts described the whaling preferences of Europeans. For instance, an Old Norse text from around 1250 A.D. cautions that “there are certain varieties that are fierce and savage toward men and are constantly seeking to destroy them at every chance,” but other, more docile species of whales “are constantly being caught and driven to land by the hundreds, and where many are caught, they provide much food for men.”Youri van den Hurk, a zooarchaeologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and an author of the study, wanted to back up the information in these texts with physical, biological evidence. So he and his colleagues examined 719 pieces of whale bones collected at archaeological sites from Norway to Portugal.","“These whale bones are semi-regularly found during archaeological excavations, but they’re often very fragmented,” Dr. van den Hurk said. “Identifying these whale bones to the species level is actually fairly hard, even when these bones are really complete.”Bones contain a protein called collagen, and the chemical makeup of collagen differs across whale species and families.","“This can give us a lot of information about what kind of species these bones actually represent,” Dr. van den Hurk said.","Analysis of the results pointed to a disproportionate number of whales that are now extinct in the northeastern Atlantic. The 334 right whales that turned up in the analysis weren’t a surprise to Dr. van den Hurk, because they’re frequently mentioned in historical sources, and some survived until the early 20th century.","But the results also showed that 110 of the bones belonged to gray whales, which are not as well documented.","“To come across so many of them was quite a surprise,” Dr. van den Hurk said.","It’s nearly impossible to tell whether a bone fragment came from a whale that was actively hunted as opposed to salvaged from a whale that washed up on the beach. However, right and gray whales have long been prized by hunters because they’re more docile than other species, and their bodies float. The disproportionate number of right and gray whale bones at archaeological sites indicates that ancient Europeans were seeking out these species.","Dr. van den Hurk and his colleagues hypothesize that centuries of targeting these species contributed to their eventual population collapse in the region. In the case of gray whales, the “final blow that actually contributed to the complete extirpation of this species from the North Atlantic was dealt by whalers” centuries ago, he said.","Vicki Ellen Szabo, a historian at Western Carolina University, who reviewed the paper for the journal, said that the research was “striking” for the evidence it puts forward for a human role in the disappearance of Europe’s right and gray whales.","“Did humans put the nail in the coffin of the species in the North Atlantic? Unclear. Did they contribute to that? Yes,” Dr. Szabo said. “I think it is an extremely cautionary tale. It shows people used to perceive of the ocean as this limitless, boundless supply, until it wasn’t, until the whales shifted course, or the whales could no longer be found.”The threat to North Atlantic right whales continues, with as few as 300 individuals left in the entire world. Gray whales have been gone from the North Atlantic for centuries but are still common in the North Pacific.","Knowing more about where gray whales once lived in European waters could allow scientists to help conserve current populations, especially as climate change alters the whales’ ecosystems.","“By looking into the past, we can optimize our understanding of what potential modern or future whale individuals will do in European waters and protect them more efficiently,” Dr. van den Hurk said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/science/european-whales-extinction.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/15/multimedia/15tb-euro-whales-01-mwvj/15tb-euro-whales-01-mwvj-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-15 04:00:24+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:57.103763+00');

country had spotted a bright flash in Jupiter’s atmosphere.","Dr. Arimatsu, who runs an observation program to study the outer solar system using backyard astronomy equipment, put out a call for more information. Six more reports of the Aug. 28 flash — which, according to Dr. Arimatsu, is one of the brightest ever recorded on the giant gas planet — came in from Japanese skywatchers.","Flashes like these are caused by asteroids or comets from the edges of our solar system that impact Jupiter’s atmosphere. “Direct observation of these bodies is virtually impossible, even with advanced telescopes,” Dr. Arimatsu wrote in an email. But Jupiter’s gravity lures in these objects, which eventually slam into the planet, “making it a unique and invaluable tool for studying them directly,” he said.","Characterizing these flashes is a crucial way to understand our solar system’s history. They offer “a glimpse of the violent processes that were happening in the early days of our solar system,” said Leigh Fletcher, a planetary scientist at the University of Leicester in England. It’s like “seeing planetary evolution in action,” he added.","Today, powerful impacts into Jupiter are a lot more rare, but they do occur. In 1994, one comet whacked into Jupiter with so much force that it left a visible debris field. Astronomers saw another massive impact in 2009.","Most collisions with Jupiter, the solar system’s fifth planet, are witnessed opportunistically by amateur astronomers. (Eight of the nine flashes seen on Jupiter since 2010 were reported by amateurs, according to Dr. Arimatsu.) Typically they use a technique called lucky imaging, which takes a video of a portion of the sky at a high frame rate.","Those frames contain “a treasure trove of data,” Dr. Fletcher said, from which professional astronomers can deduce information about Jupiter’s atmosphere, meteorology and storms. According to Dr. Arimatsu’s initial analyses, the flash reported in August had an impact comparable to the 1908 Tunguska explosion in Siberia, which experts believe was an asteroid that ripped apart 800 square miles of forest. This is the second Jupiter event observed in the past decade with this much energy, said Dr. Arimatsu, who reported the last one in 2021, with an estimated energy equivalent to two megatons of TNT.","Still, the latest impact wasn’t strong enough to leave behind a visible debris field, Dr. Fletcher said. Scientists study such traces to learn how the chemistry and temperature of Jupiter respond. Similar collisions might once have been important for generating the composition of planets seen in our own solar system, he added, and maybe in others, too.","Astronomers focus on Jupiter because it’s big, making it easy to see and more likely to suffer the impact of cosmic debris. But some scientists think that Saturn’s rings were once shaped by such explosions, and tentative evidence indicates that Uranus and Neptune have also been hit.","“If I was a betting man, I would say that all of our giant planets are being bombarded by asteroids and comets,” Dr. Fletcher said.","Stargazers are waiting for the next big flash — one that will create enough wreckage to be seen from Earth. When that happens, astronomers around the world will turn their telescopes toward Jupiter to study the fallout, with the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes likely to join in, too.","But because these winks in space are captured by chance, it’s the amateurs who are really pulling the weight in this line of research. “You can’t have hours and hours, night after night, on big professional telescopes,” Dr. Fletcher said. “You have to have dedicated backyard astronomers across the globe to be able to do it.”Dr. Arimatsu also emphasizes the importance of small-scale astronomy initiatives in a field overrun by massive projects. “It’s a vital part of the scientific community that often goes overlooked,” he said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/science/jupiter-comet-flashes.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/autossell/14sci-jupiter-flash/14sci-jupiter-flash-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-15 17:26:50+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:57.564777+00');

Gogh’s sunflowers to Edvard Munch’s “The Scream,” there’s no shortage of seminal artwork that was made with a striking hue known as cadmium yellow. But that riot of color that artists squeezed from their paint tubes isn’t necessarily what museum goers see today: cadmium yellow’s brilliance often diminishes over time, as the paint fades and turns chalky.","And it’s not only centuries-old artworks that are affected. A team of art conservators and scientists recently analyzed bits of degraded cadmium yellow paint taken from pieces painted by the Spanish artist Joan Miró in the 1970s. One particular brand of paint was likely most responsible for the degradation observed in the Miró pieces, the team concluded in a study published in July in the journal Heritage Science.","Cadmium yellow paint is an amalgam primarily of cadmium and sulfur. It was first commercialized in the 1840s, and soon gained renown among artists. Miró described the color as “splendid.” Tubes of cadmium yellow paint, including Cadmium Yellow Lemon No.1 produced by the Parisian manufacturer Lucien Lefebvre-Foinet, litter Miró’s two studios in Mallorca, Spain.","In 2020, Mar Gómez Lobón, an art conservator based in Mallorca, began investigating the paints that Miró used after he settled on the island in the 1950s. An art conservator at the Pilar and Joan Miro Foundation in Mallorca had tipped her off that more than 25 pieces in the foundation’s collection painted in the 1970s showed evidence of degraded yellow paint.","To dig into the cause of the deterioration, and whether it could be linked to a particular brand of paint, Ms. Gómez Lobón and her colleagues collected tiny flecks of cadmium yellow paint from three untitled pieces that Miró painted between 1973 and 1978. The team also scooped up small samples from three paint tubes from the artist’s Taller Sert and Son Boter studios, a cup used for mixing paint and two palettes. Each sample was roughly the size of a pinhead.","A microscopic sample of paint is enough for many scientific analyses. And there are distinct advantages to analyzing just a fleck of paint, said David Muller, a physicist at Cornell University, who was not involved in the Miró research. Transporting a valuable piece of artwork to a laboratory is logistically complicated. “You’ve got this very fancy security procedure,” Dr. Muller said. But there’s a lot less pressure to working with a paint sample just a thousandth of an inch wide, which is what Dr. Muller and colleagues did when they studied the degradation of cadmium yellow in “The Scream.”Ms. Gómez Lobón and her collaborators analyzed the nine samples from Miró’s paintings and studio materials by recording how the paint absorbed, reflected and re-emitted different wavelengths of light. That allowed the team to investigate the chemical makeup and crystalline structure of each sample.","The elemental analyses revealed that the degraded paint samples from the three paintings all contained primarily cadmium and sulfur, as expected, with traces of zinc. The same mix was found in paint samples from the two palettes and one of the tubes of paint. Furthermore those six samples — from the degraded paintings, the palettes and the tube of Cadmium Yellow Lemon No.1 by Lucien Lefebvre-Foinet — all exhibited poor crystallinity, the team found. That means that the cadmium and sulfur atoms aren’t perfectly interlocked in their usual hexagonal arrangement, said Daniela Comelli, a materials scientist at the Polytechnic University of Milan and a member of the research team. “There’s some disorder.”Poor crystallinity of cadmium yellow was also believed to be partially responsible for the degradation observed in older artworks by Picasso, Matisse and other artists. (Environmental conditions, particularly humidity and temperature, have also been shown to play a role.) But these new results highlight the fact that this problem persisted well into the middle of the 20th century, which the researchers found surprising.","“You would think that the paint manufacturers would have corrected the problem,” Ms. Gómez Lobón said. Lucien Lefebvre-Foinet was, in addition, a well-regarded brand, she said. “This was a really high-quality paint.”In the future, Ms. Gómez Lobón plans to catalog the 100 or so tubes of paint still strewn around Miró’s studios. She hopes to precisely age date the Lucien Lefebvre-Foinet tubes and better understand how the brand produced its paint, specifically its cadmium yellow. Miró left behind a treasure trove of supplies that should be studied, Ms. Gómez Lobón said. “These studios are like a gold mine.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/science/joan-miro-yellow-paint-fading.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/18/multimedia/18tb-miro-02-jhfv/18tb-miro-02-jhfv-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-18 09:01:57.492+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:58.223781+00');

Broad', 'science', '["Ocean experts have long clashed over whether artifacts from the world’s most famous shipwreck should be retrieved for exhibits that could help people better understand the Titanic tragedy or whether they should be left untouched in the sea’s depths as a monument to the more than 1,500 people who lost their lives. James Cameron, known for his 1997 movie “Titanic,” sees himself as negotiating a middle path through this complicated and often emotional dispute.","Mr. Cameron dove 33 times to the shipwreck from 1995 through 2005, giving him a window on its condition and likely fate. His perspective is timely because the United States government recently sought to exert control over the wreck, raising questions about whether a company that has recovered more than 5,500 artifacts will be allowed to gather more.","Mr. Cameron’s views are also deeply personal. He often debated the retrievals with Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French submariner who died in June while descending to the shipwreck in the Titan submersible. Mr. Nargeolet also directed underwater research for RMS Titanic Inc.",", the company that holds the exclusive salvage rights to the ship and its artifacts.","Mr. Cameron recently answered questions by email from The New York Times about his recovery views, the Titanic’s future and the Titan submersible. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.","Did you see signs of natural decay during your 10 years of Titanic dives?We’ve seen significant deterioration to thin-walled structures such as the deckhouse (the uppermost deck above the boat deck) and the forward mast. It was intact (in its fallen position) in 2001 but partially collapsed in 2005. New imaging by the Magellan company in 2022 shows that it has completely collapsed and broken open.","However, we’ve not seen any significant deterioration to the vast majority of the wreck, such as the hull plates. Their steel is one and a half inches thick. I believe the plates will still be standing for another two centuries at least.","How about damage by visitors? Anything obvious?Based on my experience maneuvering around the wreck, and landing on top of it, the submersibles do nothing of significance. Up top, a submersible weighs several tons but down there, in order to fly around, it must be neutrally buoyant, which means it touches down with only a few pounds of force. Besides, anything humans do is trivial compared to the relentless deterioration caused by biological activity, which goes on year after year. The Titanic is being eaten by living colonies of bacteria. They love it when humans drop giant piles of steel into the deep ocean, which we do with some regularity, especially in wars. It’s a feast for them.","On the Titanic’s artifacts, you describe yourself as a centrist between preservationists such as Robert D. Ballard and salvors such as Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who died in June on the Titan submersible. How so?On one hand, I think it’s good to recover artifacts from the debris field. When Titanic broke in two at the surface, it became like two great piñatas. Over square miles, we see plates and wine bottles, suitcases, shoes — things people carried with them, touched and wore.","That humanizes the story and reminds us that the tragedy has a human face. So many artifacts have been recovered that poignantly connect us to this history — like the bell from the crow’s nest which was rung three times by lookout Frederick Fleet when he first spotted the iceberg. Now, millions of museumgoers can see it with their own eyes. I’ve even rung it myself. And there are so many examples of Titanic’s elegance — fine china, beaded chandeliers, the cherub statue from the Grand Staircase. It’s the ongoing public interest in these things that keeps the history alive, now, 111 years after the sinking. A gray area that leaves me torn is whether we should recover artifacts from inside the bow and stern sections. One case I find compelling is recovery of the Marconi set. This wireless system sent the SOS signal that brought the rescue ship Carpathia to Titanic’s exact coordinates, and arguably saved the lives of over 700 people.","The Titanic’s wireless set was unique, very different from others in its day. I’ve flown my tiny remotely operated vehicles inside to survey the Marconi rooms, so we know where everything is and have done computer reconstructions.","But to actually put that instrument on public display would be very moving for millions of museumgoers. If it could be recovered without any harm done to the outer appearance of the wreck, I’d be in favor, because that area of the ship is deteriorating fast and within a few years the Marconi set will be buried deep inside the ruins, unrecoverable.","So anything goes?Where I personally draw the line is changing the look of the wreck — such as raising its iconic bow (where Jack and Rose stood in the movie) or removing the mighty anchors or taking the bronze telemotor from the bridge where Quartermaster Hitchens desperately spun the ship’s wheel trying to avoid the iceberg. All these recoveries have been discussed by somebody at some point over the last quarter century. I think we shouldn’t take anything from the bow and stern sections that would disfigure them. They should stand as monuments to the tragedy.","You knew Mr. Nargeolet quite well. Did you have any disagreements with him and his company’s approach to artifact recovery?He was a legendary sub pilot and explorer, and we spent many exciting hours going over our Titanic videos and comparing notes. He recovered many of the artifacts, such as the crow’s nest bell, that I find so moving in the various exhibits around the world.","That said, I disagreed with him about some of his plans to recover such things as the bow anchors, though it was always a friendly discussion. I’m glad some of those plans never came to fruition.","Around 2017, you joined with Dr. Ballard and the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, in an unsuccessful attempt to buy the collection of Titanic artifacts and move them to Belfast, where the ship was built. Why? And would you try again if RMS Titanic once again declared bankruptcy?Our concern at the time was that the collection could have been bought by a rich private collector and disappear from the public’s view. These artifacts belong to the world, as part of our shared cultural heritage — our collective history — and the artifacts help keep that history alive and the tragedy palpable. But only if they can be seen, and emotionally felt, through public access. If the collection is put at risk again, down the line, I would hope to have a voice in keeping it publicly accessible.","What do you make of the federal government’s recent effort to exert control over the Titanic?The Titanic lies in international waters. I’m sure this tussle will go on indefinitely.","Do you think the Titan disaster will have an impact on Titanic visitors?Do I believe it will stop people from wanting to witness Titanic in person? Absolutely not. Human curiosity is a powerful force, and the urge to go and bear witness with one’s own eyes is very strong for some people, myself included.","But citizen explorers must be more discerning about who they dive with. Is the sub fully certified by a recognized bureau? What is the safe operating record of the submersible company? These are the kinds of questions they need to ask.","Would you dive again?I would get in a sub tomorrow — if it was certified, like Woods Hole Oceanographic’s storied Alvin sub, or the subs built by Triton submersibles. But there’s no rush to do anything. That familiar image of the bow will still be there, as it is, for another half century at least."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/science/titanic-james-cameron-titan.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/science/19sci-cameron/19sci-cameron-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 18:31:49+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:58.742003+00');

Oliver Whang', 'science', '["Have you ever talked to someone who is “into consciousness?” How did that conversation go? Did they make a vague gesture in the air with both hands? Did they reference the Tao Te Ching or Jean-Paul Sartre? Did they say that, actually, there’s nothing scientists can be sure about, and that reality is only as real as we make it out to be?The fuzziness of consciousness, its imprecision, has made its study anathema in the natural sciences. At least until recently, the project was largely left to philosophers, who often were only marginally better than others at clarifying their object of study. Hod Lipson, a roboticist at Columbia University, said that some people in his field referred to consciousness as “the C-word.” Grace Lindsay, a neuroscientist at New York University, said, “There was this idea that you can’t study consciousness until you have tenure.”Nonetheless, a few weeks ago, a group of philosophers, neuroscientists and computer scientists, Dr. Lindsay among them, proposed a rubric with which to determine whether an A.I. system like ChatGPT could be considered conscious. The report, which surveys what Dr. Lindsay calls the “brand-new” science of consciousness, pulls together elements from a half-dozen nascent empirical theories and proposes a list of measurable qualities that might suggest the presence of some presence in a machine.","For instance, recurrent processing theory focuses on the differences between conscious perception (for example, actively studying an apple in front of you) and unconscious perception (such as your sense of an apple flying toward your face). Neuroscientists have argued that we unconsciously perceive things when electrical signals are passed from the nerves in our eyes to the primary visual cortex and then to deeper parts of the brain, like a baton being handed off from one cluster of nerves to another. These perceptions seem to become conscious when the baton is passed back, from the deeper parts of the brain to the primary visual cortex, creating a loop of activity.","Another theory describes specialized sections of the brain that are used for particular tasks — the part of your brain that can balance your top-heavy body on a pogo stick is different from the part of your brain that can take in an expansive landscape. We’re able to put all this information together (you can bounce on a pogo stick while appreciating a nice view), but only to a certain extent (doing so is difficult). So neuroscientists have postulated the existence of a “global workspace” that allows for control and coordination over what we pay attention to, what we remember, even what we perceive. Our consciousness may arise from this integrated, shifting workspace.","But it could also arise from the ability to be aware of your own awareness, to create virtual models of the world, to predict future experiences and to locate your body in space. The report argues that any one of these features could, potentially, be an essential part of what it means to be conscious. And, if we’re able to discern these traits in a machine, then we might be able to consider the machine conscious.","One of the difficulties of this approach is that the most advanced A.I. systems are deep neural networks that “learn” how to do things on their own, in ways that aren’t always interpretable by humans. We can glean some kinds of information from their internal structure, but only in limited ways, at least for the moment. This is the black box problem of A.I. So even if we had a full and exact rubric of consciousness, it would be difficult to apply it to the machines we use every day.","And the authors of the recent report are quick to note that theirs is not a definitive list of what makes one conscious. They rely on an account of “computational functionalism,” according to which consciousness is reduced to pieces of information passed back and forth within a system, like in a pinball machine. In principle, according to this view, a pinball machine could be conscious, if it were made much more complex. (That might mean it’s not a pinball machine anymore; let’s cross that bridge if we come to it.) But others have proposed theories that take our biological or physical features, social or cultural contexts, as essential pieces of consciousness. It’s hard to see how these things could be coded into a machine.","And even to researchers who are largely on board with computational functionalism, no existing theory seems sufficient for consciousness.","“For any of the conclusions of the report to be meaningful, the theories have to be correct,” said Dr. Lindsay. “Which they’re not.” This might just be the best we can do for now, she added.","After all, does it seem like any one of these features, or all of them combined, comprise what William James described as the “warmth” of conscious experience? Or, in Thomas Nagel’s words, “what it is like” to be you? There is a gap between the ways we can measure subjective experience with science and subjective experience itself. This is what David Chalmers has labeled the “hard problem” of consciousness. Even if an A.I. system has recurrent processing, a global workspace, and a sense of its physical location — what if it still lacks the thing that makes it feel like something?When I brought up this emptiness to Robert Long, a philosopher at the Center for A.I. Safety who led work on the report, he said, “That feeling is kind of a thing that happens whenever you try to scientifically explain, or reduce to physical processes, some high-level concept.”The stakes are high, he added; advances in A.I. and machine learning are coming faster than our ability to explain what’s going on. In 2022, Blake Lemoine, an engineer at Google, argued that the company’s LaMDA chatbot was conscious (although most experts disagreed); the further integration of generative A.I. into our lives means the topic may become more contentious. Dr. Long argues that we have to start making some claims about what might be conscious and bemoans the “vague and sensationalist” way we’ve gone about it, often conflating subjective experience with general intelligence or rationality. “This is an issue we face right now, and over the next few years,” he said.","As Megan Peters, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the report, put it, “Whether there’s somebody in there or not makes a big difference on how we treat it.”We do this kind of research already with animals, requiring careful study to make the most basic claim that other species have experiences similar to our own, or even understandable to us. This can resemble a fun house activity, like shooting empirical arrows from moving platforms toward shape-shifting targets, with bows that occasionally turn out to be spaghetti. But sometimes we get a hit. As Peter Godfrey-Smith wrote in his book “Metazoa,” cephalopods probably have a robust but categorically different kind of subjective experience from humans. Octopuses have something like 40 million neurons in each arm. What’s that like?We rely on a series of observations, inferences and experiments — both organized and not — to solve this problem of other minds. We talk, touch, play, hypothesize, prod, control, X-ray and dissect, but, ultimately, we still don’t know what makes us conscious. We just know that we are."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/science/ai-computers-consciousness.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/00SCI-CONSCIOUSNESS-bplk/00SCI-CONSCIOUSNESS-bplk-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-18 09:00:43+00', '2023-09-21 23:53:59.183892+00');

'By Maya Wei-Haas', 'science', '["Pink diamonds take the Barbiecore craze to another level, but the rosy color comes at a cost. These gems are among the most rare and valuable diamonds around. And they’re far from perfect.","“They’re actually damaged diamonds,” said Hugo Olierook, a geoscientist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.","The color comes from the warping of the gem’s crystal lattice under intense pressure. While all diamonds form under pressure, even more force turns once clear diamonds colorful. A slight extra squeeze turns a diamond pink, and a hard squash turns it brown.","More than 90 percent of the pink stones ever found came from the Argyle mine in Western Australia, which was one of the world’s most productive diamond deposits until it ceased operations in November 2020. Many of Argyle’s diamonds have a chocolatey brown or tawny hue. But out of every thousand gems, a couple would pop up in the rarer and more valuable pink.","Now Dr. Olierook and his colleagues have a new estimate for when and how these gems arrived on Earth’s surface. In a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, they reported that some 1.3 billion years ago, the blushing and brown stones were pushed through the relatively thin continental edges during the demise of Nuna, one of Earth’s earliest supercontinents. If confirmed, the work hints at the possibility that ancient continental junctures may be hiding more of these colorful gems.","The diamonds that would emerge at Argyle formed deep underground, near the stable continental roots. As landmasses smashed together to form Nuna, collisions near Australia’s northwestern edge provided the pressure needed to color the once-colorless gems.","In the late 1980s, a team led by Robert Pidgeon, now an emeritus professor at Curtin, found that Argyle’s diamond-studded volcanic rocks erupted roughly 1.2 billion years ago. During that period, there were few obvious tectonic triggers for explosive eruptions that could bring Argyle’s diamonds up from the deep.","“Australia at that point was floating happily through the oceans,” Dr. Olierook said.","But Dr. Pidgeon had long questioned his own findings. The eruption that generated Argyle’s diamond haul blasted through an ancient lake, which altered the rocks, potentially affecting the accuracy of the dating estimate. He mentioned the concern in a casual hallway conversation with another author of the study, Denis Fougerouse of Curtin University, who assembled a team to take a closer look.","The researchers produced a new estimate of the age of the Argyle rocks using a laser beam that was finer than a hair’s width. Their analysis suggests that the eruption happened roughly 1.3 billion years ago — about 100 million years before Dr. Pidgeon’s estimate.","The new date coincides with the time when Nuna began to splinter, thinning along the geologic sutures where earlier continents had collided, Dr. Olierook said. This thinning likely helped diamond-studded magma shoot to the surface near the edge of what is now northwestern Australia.","The broad link between continental rifting and diamond deposits is not a new idea, but the details are debated. A recent modeling study suggests that supercontinent breakup could trigger churning currents in the Earth’s mantle that send diamond-rich eruptions punching through its crust.","These currents likely ripple inland over time, which could help explain why most diamond-rich eruptions blast through thick continental interiors. Yet the Argyle diamonds, which erupted near the continental edge, may represent an early phase of this process before the eruptions marched inland.","The new study is an important step toward deciphering the “perfect storm of conditions” that helped create Argyle’s colorful gems, said Thomas Gernon, a geologist at the University of Southampton in England who has studied how diamonds are shaped by supercontinent splits.","Yet some questions remain. “This is the last part of the story,” said Steve Shirey, an isotope geochemist at Carnegie Science in Washington, D.C., who was not part of the study team. For example, he wonders why so much carbon had collected to create Argyle’s abundance of diamonds in the first place.","David Phillips, a geochemist at the University of Melbourne, points out that the new age range for Argyle could be further narrowed. “The conclusions of this study might be correct, but in my opinion, this remains an open question,” he said.","Dr. Gernon emphasized that understanding such an ancient system is no simple undertaking. And one thing is for sure, he said: “Nature always throws up surprises.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/science/pink-diamonds-australia-supercontinent.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/19tb-pink-diamonds-01-wgfl/19tb-pink-diamonds-01-wgfl-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 16:07:50.401+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:00.130562+00');

'By Sam Jones', 'science', '["For hundreds of millions of years, pancake-shaped animals the size of a needle tip have been roving the seas with an appetite for tasty microbes and algae. They’re called placozoans, and are among the simplest of the major animal lineages.","As simple as they are, a team of researchers has found compelling evidence of neuron-like cells in placozoans. And given how long these animals have existed, it’s possible that placozoans served as the blueprint for the nervous systems in more complex animals, including humans. The work was published in the journal Cell on Tuesday.","Look under a microscope and you may think at first glance that placozoans are amoebas. But the organisms are animals. In the tree of life, they are more closely related to cnidarians (which include sea anemones and corals) or bilaterians (the supergroup that contains vertebrates) than lineages such as ctenophores or poriferans. While these other animal lineages have nervous systems governed by the nerve cells known as neurons, placozoans were thought to be different.","“No one would have thought that these organisms had anything even resembling neurons,” said Xavier Grau-Bové, a researcher at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain.","Placozoan bodies are simple, only three cell layers thick. But that’s enough to glide around, absorb and digest food, and respond to their surrounding environment. Instead of being controlled by neurons, some of these behaviors are regulated by peptidergic cells, which release short chains of amino acids that activate surrounding cells.","Because the activity of peptidergic cells is reminiscent of more complex nervous systems — like the one in humans — Dr. Grau-Bové and his colleagues were intrigued by the possibility that these cells and their connections might represent the nervous system of an ancient animal ancestor.","The research team began by analyzing gene expression — which bits of DNA are converted into RNA used to make cell proteins — in more than 65,000 individual cells across four placozoan species. They discovered that placozoans have 14 types of peptidergic cells that are also important for building neurons in cnidarians and bilaterians. However, they also found that peptidergic cells were not true neurons given their lack of electrical activity and inability to receive messages.","The researchers then created a map showing potential interactions between peptidergic cells and other cells in placozoans. They identified a complex signaling network as well as specific pairs of neuropeptides and receptors. These cellular relationships support what scientists call the chemical brain hypothesis, the idea that early nervous systems evolved as networks of cells connected through chemical signals that would diffuse across an animal and bind to specific protein receptors.","The scientists then compared peptidergic cells to neurons or neuron-like cells in other animal species. They confirmed major similarities between the way genes are used in placozoan peptidergic cells with the way neurons work in cnidarian and bilaterian animals. That indicated that early nervous systems were once similar to what is seen in placozoans today, before evolving for hundreds of millions of years into complex cells that send electrical signals.","“Their result showing the genetic similarity of these peptidergic cells to neurons was very striking,” said Jacob Musser, a molecular evolutionary biologist at Yale University who was not involved in the study. “It suggests that some of the neuronal machinery was being packaged into cells and used for some form of communication prior to the advent of a nervous system.”Dr. Musser said he was looking forward to seeing similar approaches applied to investigations of nervous system evolution in more ancient animal lineages like ctenophores, which include comb jellies. The place of their distinctive nervous systems in evolution remains unclear.","Michael Paulin, a computational evolutionary neuroscientist at the University of Otago in New Zealand who was also not involved in the research, said placozoans were the best living model of early animal nervous systems. He suggested it was possible “that the ancestors of animals with nervous systems were placozoans,” adding that studying them “may help us to understand what all those neurons are doing in our brains.”Although placozoans are simple compared with humans, “the complexity of the whole system is much higher than what we anticipated,” said Arnau Sebé-Pedrós, an author of the study at the Center for Genomic Regulation. But, he said, “evolutionary biology is a historical science,” and additional research can always lead to new understandings of how life became what it is today."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/science/placazoans-neurons-evolution.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/19tb-neurons-cwqk/19tb-neurons-cwqk-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 15:00:09.386+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:00.733778+00');

Wednesday that describes notched and tapered logs buried under sand in Zambia.","The discovery drastically pushes back the historical record of structural woodworking. Before, the oldest known examples of this craft were 9,000-year-old platforms on the edge of a British lake.","Ancient wood products are extremely rare because the organic material typically degrades over thousands of years, said Annemieke Milks, an archaeologist at the University of Reading who was not involved in the new study, which appeared in the journal Nature. “It almost never preserves,” she said.","It’s not clear what early humans were building in Africa. Dr. Milks said that the new discovery suggested that they used wood not just for spears or digging sticks, but also for far more ambitious creations such as platforms or walkways.","“I think most early human groups would have been using wood in some form,” she said. “We just don’t see it.”The logs were discovered by an international team of scientists in 2019 near an enormous waterfall in Zambia known as the Kalambo Falls. There, the Kalambo River drops 770 feet before flowing into Lake Tanganyika.","For archaeologists, the site has a checkered history. In the 1950s, a British archaeologist, Desmond Clark, found ancient stone tools near the falls, as well as pieces of wood that he proposed had been digging sticks and spears. Other pieces looked as if they had been burned; it would have been some of the oldest evidence of people making fires.","By the early 2000s, however, much of the luster of Dr. Clark’s discovery had disappeared. For one thing, he never got a firm fix on the age of the wood. The only reliable method available at the time to determine age was radiocarbon dating, which can be used only on objects less than 50,000 years old. The wood pieces at Kalambo Falls proved to be older than that — but how much older?Other researchers questioned whether people had actually crafted the wooden objects. Dr. Clark acknowledged that they might have been branches that had fallen into the Kalambo River and were reshaped by sand grains carried in the water flowing toward the falls.","In 2006, Lawrence Barham, an archaeologist at the University of Liverpool, and his colleagues returned to the Kalambo Falls. By then, researchers had developed a new way to determine the age of archaeological sites, taking advantage of how quartz grains can act like geological clocks. As naturally occurring uranium atoms break down in the ground, they release energy that gets trapped inside the quartz. Over time, the grains store more and more energy, which scientists can later measure in their labs. The more energy, the older the specimen.","On their trip to the Kalambo Falls in 2006, the scientists found more stone tools. Geoff Duller, a geophysicist at Aberystwyth University in Wales, collected sand from the riverbanks, and spent the next few years measuring its trapped energy. . He determined that the oldest layers of sediment that contained stone tools were 300,000 to 500,000 years old.","That meant the tools were made well before the evolution of modern humans. The scientists suspect they might have been made by an earlier species present in Zambia, known as Homo heidelbergensis.","The researchers made another trip to the falls, in 2019, and Dr. Duller had planned to use an even more powerful dating technique based on feldspar grains rather than quartz.","But when they arrived at Dr. Clark’s old site, they discovered it had vanished. In the 13 years since their last trip, the river had shifted away. All that was left was a reed-filled marsh.","Fortunately, Dr. Barham had prepared a Plan B. Before the expedition, he used Google Earth to spot a promising strip of beach along the Kalambo River. When they got there, Dr. Barham immediately saw a stick jutting out of the sand. In the water, he found a sharpened tip that fit perfectly on one end of the stick. If he had come a year later, the fragments might have washed away. “It was just a moment of luck,” Dr. Barham said.","In the same area, the researchers found stone tools along with wood shaped into wedges and V’s — clear signs of handiwork.","Dr. Duller used the feldspar grains to determine the age of the artifacts. He found that the objects came from three distinct ages: 487,000 years ago, 390,000 years and 324,000 years. It’s possible that people lived by the river throughout that time or returned to it over thousands of generations.","At the end of the field season in 2019, the researchers made their most spectacular discovery. In the oldest layer of sand, they uncovered a four-and-a-half-foot log of a small African tree known as Zeyher’s bushwillow. Near the log’s tapered end, the researchers noticed a large notch. When they dug farther down, they realized the notched part of the log was resting on an even bigger tree trunk.","As the researchers exposed the wood, they took high-resolution photographs. The pictures revealed chop marks on the log and the trunk, suggesting that people had worked them with axes and scraping tools. “This is deliberate,” Dr. Barham said. “This is intentional.”Dr. Milks said taking photographs of the ancient wooden objects as soon as they were discovered was crucial for understanding how they were crafted. The waterlogged sand allowed the wood to survive for hundreds of thousands of years almost unchanged. But when ancient wood is exposed to the air again, it can lose essential clues in a matter of minutes. “It can shrink, it can warp — all sorts of things can happen,” Dr. Milks said.","Dr. Barham and his colleagues collaborated with John Mukopa, a traditional Zambian woodworker, to interpret their findings. They suspect that people cut down live trees with stone axes. They then worked the wood so that the two pieces could fit together into some larger structure.","Dr. Barham speculated that the log and the trunk were part of a structure built above the marshy land along the Kalambo River. “It’s about keeping your feet dry, or keeping your food dry, or keeping your firewood dry,” he said.","“Put yourself in the mind of somebody living there almost 480,000 years ago with a big brain,” he said. “Don’t be frightened of complex suggestions.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/science/ancient-human-woodworking.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/20/science/20SCI-wood-01/20SCI-wood-01-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 15:00:10+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:01.025072+00');

the 19th century. Unlike the Indigenous farmers, who lived in long houses, the Punan roamed the island’s northern rainforest in family groups, hunting bearded pigs, harvesting starchy plants and gathering forest products for trade.","They were not only misunderstood, but mistreated. Over decades, the Indonesian government stripped the Punan of their ancestral lands and encouraged them, sometimes forcibly, to settle in ready-built villages. By the 1990s, anthropologists believed that the group’s traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle had vanished. In 2002, a census of the Punan in eastern Borneo focused only on the villages, because so few nomads were thought to exist.","And so in 2018, when Stephen Lansing, an anthropologist at the Santa Fe Institute, and Pradiptajati Kusuma, a geneticist at the Mochtar Riady Institute for Nanotechnology in Tangerang, Indonesia, said they had learned of a clan of about 30 Punan families who sheltered in limestone caves and rarely, if ever, emerged from the forest, many experts were skeptical. But with funding from the National Science Foundation, the scientists made contact with the nomadic group in 2018, and began collecting data with the aim of ensuring their health and welfare.","After that first trip, Dr. Lansing returned to Santa Fe with photographs of a man wearing a loincloth made of bark fiber, along with recordings of a song language he believed resembled no other. His initial description of these people, who call themselves the Cave Punan or Punan Batu, was published last year in the journal Evolutionary Human Sciences. Press reports in the Indonesian media catalyzed the local government to declare the Punan Batu as regular users of their forest, a first step toward obtaining the right to manage it under national laws.","Some experts remain doubtful that this unusual group could really have been secluded for so long. The skeptics have compared the announcement to that of the Tasaday, a “lost tribe” discovered in the Philippines in 1971, whose isolation was eventually determined to be an exaggeration, if not a hoax.","Bernard Sellato, a Punan specialist with the French National Center for Scientific Research, has been particularly fierce in his criticism. In an email, he referred to the Punan Batu and other coastal groups as “‘fake’ Punan.” Based on historical accounts and ethnographies, he remains convinced their ancestors were not native to the island, but rather enslaved people imported from New Guinea and eastern Indonesia several centuries ago.","But a new study focusing on the DNA of the Punan Batu, recently accepted by a scientific journal, is poised to eliminate the doubts of all but the most hardened critics. Based on the limited diversity revealed in the genes of the Punan Batu, they appear to have been isolated for more than 20 generations. Dr. Sellato’s contention that the Punan Batu are the descendants of imported slaves does not fit with these results.","The new findings could also put to rest a century-old debate about when the Punan arrived in Borneo, and how they became hunter-gatherers in the first place. And the research could help make the case that the Punan Batu deserve a hand in managing their forest, which is threatened by encroaching palm oil plantations and commercial forestry operations.","“What they desperately want,” Dr. Lansing said, “is to stop the destruction of their forests.”Borneo, the third-largest island in the world, is covered by rugged mountains, rainforests and swamps. Its population of 21 million is divided between three countries: Malaysia and the tiny kingdom of Brunei, to the north, and Indonesia, which controls three-quarters of the territory in the south.","The island’s population has been shaped by waves of migration. Caves in the north were used by Stone Age hunter-gatherers at least 50,000 years ago, when a land bridge linked the island to mainland Southeast Asia. Contemporary Indigenous groups, collectively known as the Dayak, are thought to have arrived by sea from Taiwan 4,000 to 6,000 years ago, bringing domesticated rice with them.","Where the Punan came from is unclear. Other parts of Southeast Asia are home to scattered groups of hunter-gatherers who share a suite of physical features including dark skin, a short stature and tight, curly hair. They are the descendants of the first wave of modern humans who departed from Africa more than 60,000 years ago and made their way east, where they encountered and sometimes mixed with now-extinct hominins.","On Borneo, however, the only hunter-gatherers that early European explorers encountered, the Punan, looked similar to the farming Dayaks. And many Punan groups, including the nomadic Punan Batu, had long-established trade relationships with settled communities.","By the mid-1700s, a Muslim kingdom known as Bulungan controlled part of the northeast coast. According to legend, after the Punan Batu failed to deliver the Sultan a wife, they appeased him with nests of swiftlet birds from the forest, which were exported to China, where they were prized for bird’s nest soup.","The Punan Batu performed risky work for the Sultan, collecting nests from the caves and honey from treetops, along with rattan and fragrant agar wood. In exchange, the Sultan gave them tobacco, rice and metal tools. Though they were no longer exclusively reliant on wild food staples, they remained isolated. In 1903, a Dutch resident described them as being “at the lowest level of development.” Thirty years later, another Dutchman, a geologist, referred to them as “a backward group, which almost does not mix with other Punan.”Even after the Sultanate dissolved in 1959 and its territory became an Indonesian regency, the family maintained control of its forest resources. Abdul Karim, a voluble man in his late 60s and a descendant of the Sultanate, said that as recently as the 1980s one of his older relatives, Prince Har, treated the Punan Batu almost as his slaves. Har was “really strict to the Punan,” Karim said, telling them: “You stay in the forest, you cannot go to the city.”Scientists, in the meantime, have long questioned the notion of a Punan identity. In 1945, Fay-Cooper Cole — an anthropologist who had defended natural selection during the Scopes Monkey Trial — argued that the Punan were not full-time hunter-gatherers. He suggested that they were villagers out “camping.”Later researchers noted that Punan groups in different regions spoke different languages, which were more closely related to those of neighboring Dayak communities than to other Punan. The Punan, they suggested, were actually Dayak who had abandoned agriculture to focus their activities on the forest.","Dr. Lansing came to Borneo after spending 40 years studying rice farmers on a far more developed Indonesian island, Bali. There, he found that a thousand-year-old system of coordinating irrigation and planting through regular gatherings at local temples provided greater yields than did the application of fertilizer and pesticides. His work led, in 2012, to the designation of the water temple landscape as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.","Over the last decade, he began collaborating with researchers at one of Indonesia’s pre-eminent genetics laboratories, in an attempt to understand human migration across the archipelago. During a trip to Borneo in 2017, he and Dr. Kusuma first heard a report about the Punan Batu from a self-appointed Punan leader from another area, Thomas Mita. Mr. Mita offered to guide the researchers there — for a steep price.","In his grant proposal with the National Science Foundation, Dr. Lansing described how he would be making “first contact” with the Punan Batu, a bold claim that contributed to early concerns about his credibility. Experts did not believe there were any uncontacted Indigenous groups in Borneo. It was only after Dr. Lansing paid Mr. Mita to take him there in 2018 that he learned Mr. Mita had previously brought in other foreigners. “I guess he was running little tours to discover the ‘exotic primitives,’” Dr. Lansing said.","Far from being discouraged by such stage management, the incident piqued his curiosity, for the people he met were practicing a nomadic, subsistence lifestyle that no longer existed in other parts of Borneo. When Dr. Lansing was planning to return in 2019 with three other scientists, he invited me and a photographer to accompany him. The group planned to spend five days camping with the nomads, conducting interviews and handing out GPS belts to record their movements.","A dozen or so Punan Batu met us on our first morning at Abdul Karim’s trading post, where the Indonesian Ministry of Health held a monthly medical clinic for them. In the afternoon, we all climbed into a small fleet of motorized canoes for the journey up the Sajau River. The longtail engines snarled and popped as the boats seesawed over fallen logs and jolted up small rapids.","Three hours up the meandering river, we arrived at our first campsite. Dr. Lansing and his entourage disembarked from the canoes and, the following day, climbed the lower flanks of a small mountain, guided by the Punan Batu and their pint-size, brown hunting dogs. The men cleared a trail through the muddy forest while the women carried their infants and possessions in baskets on their backs.","One man held a blow gun and wore a loin cloth with blue gym shorts underneath. A young boy whose family no longer lived full-time in the forest had a machete-like knife slung across his shoulders. His eyes were glued to a cellphone in his hands, though there was no reception. He was playing a video game.","Halfway up the mountain was a cavern as large as an amphitheater. The cave, which contained a dense concentration of swiftlet nests, is a sacred site for the Punan, who consider it the source of all things. Once inside, a man named Ma’ruf took a seat on the dirt floor. He was in his early 40s but appeared to be half that age, with swooped-over bangs and the youthful skin that comes from a life lived in the shade.","When Ma’ruf was a boy, he told Dr. Lansing, his father and two other Punan men tried to collect and sell birds’ nests from the highest reaches of this cave, but without the permission of Prince Har. They were caught and spent months in prison; it was a desperate time, when Ma’ruf and his mother struggled to survive.","Ma’ruf began to hum, a deep and powerful vocalization that rose from his chest and echoed through the cave. Words took shape in a language only the elders understood. “I am like a porcupine who comes to the cave to rest,” he chanted, according to a translation of a recording of the chant made by Dr. Lansing.","The next singer up was a shirtless man in his 60s named Bo’odon. “I am a true friend of yours,” he sang to Dr. Lansing. “When might this bear fruit, I ask myself. May our relationship bring the return of our lands to us.”Such song languages represent a fluid form of creative expression. Unlike a typical spoken language, where different speakers will identify common objects and concepts using the same words more than 95 percent of the time, there was only a 70 percent overlap in the vocabulary used by different Punan Batu singers, according to word lists Dr. Lansing has gathered.","Dr. Lansing has wondered if any unknown words in the songs may have been passed down from Borneo’s Stone Age hunter-gatherers, who we know from bones and cave paintings. Determining whether the Punan Batu are descendants of those cave dwellers, or if they may have coexisted with them, would require a genetic analysis.","Dr. Kusuma has collected blood from 12 individuals, with approval of his institution’s ethics board. Because most of the Punan Batu cannot read or write, he explained to them how their blood would be analyzed, and obtained their consent.","He has now analyzed those DNA samples, along with samples of other Punan and Dayak in Borneo and those of Indigenous groups from Sumatra and West Papua. The Punan Batu, the study found, are most closely related to the Punan Tubu and Punan Aput found on other rivers.","By comparing the Punan’s genes with the ancient remains of a female hunter-gatherer from an island in the Taiwan Strait, Dr. Kusuma has concluded that the Punan broke away from mainland populations more than 7,000 years ago. The findings rule out the possibility that they were Dayak farmers who had recently reverted to a hunting and gathering lifestyle.","The study has been accepted for publication in the journal Cell Reports, Dr. Kusuma said.","Hoh Boon-Peng, a geneticist at the International Medical University in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said that the results align with a growing view that the settlement of Southeast Asia was achieved through multiple waves of migration. He noted, however, that more fossil DNA is needed to precisely date the split between the ancestors of the Punan and the Dayak.","Dr. Sellato of the French National Center for Scientific Research has long maintained that the Punan were not “farmers gone bush,” as he put it, yet he remained skeptical of the significance of the Punan Batu to that century-old debate. He admitted that he did not have the expertise to evaluate the new genetic data, but argued that “any sensible, self-respecting Punan would quickly disappear into the far hinterland” rather than become a “slave.”From the beginning, Dr. Lansing hoped to follow the model that had succeeded within Bali, where scientific research became the pillar that supported cultural preservation.","Borneo has lost more than one-third of its forests since 1980. Although the Bulugnan regency recently recognized the Punan Batu as traditional users of the forest, their land has not received formal protection. Three companies have rights to harvest trees there, though none have yet acted on them.","More troubling to Dr. Lansing are the ever-expanding palm oil plantations, one of which has been intruding from the north, according to satellite maps.","Judging from the GPS belts the researchers left with the Punan, family groups typically spend eight or nine days at one of their camps before moving several miles to the next one. Their traditional territory is about three times the size of Manhattan.","The Nature Conservancy and the Leakey Foundation are working to have the craggy landscape declared a park, to prevent the mining of the limestone mountains for cement. The material is in demand as Indonesia builds its new capital, Nusantara, 250 miles to the south.","It’s unclear how much longer the Punan Batu lifestyle will last. One morning, Edi, a compact, muscular man in his 20s who has become skilled with a chain saw, gave us a tour of his one-room home in the middle of the forest. It was elevated on stilts, with fresh sawdust still on the floor. The surrounding vegetation had recently been burned, in preparation for planting sweet potatoes and sugar cane.","Dr. Lansing and Dr. Kusuma both expressed surprise at this development, which had occurred more abruptly than they had imagined. They knew of Punan who had left the forest for the city, but the only other houses this far upriver had been built by Abdul Karim, as temporary shelters to facilitate trade.","Though Edi’s framed house and farm marked a shift from the caves and bamboo lean-tos he had grown up sleeping in, he barely acknowledged its significance. “It’s nice,” he shrugged.","It has been said that a life lived on foot can make the Punan unceremonious when it comes to rites of passage. Edi said he would keep hunting, and collecting honey, but he needed to think about his children and their future. A permanent home was a start.","Audio produced by Sarah Diamond."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/science/punan-borneo-nomadic-clan.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/12/multimedia/00sci-nomads-promo/00sci-nomads-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 04:00:50+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:01.243742+00');

Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has announced that the state will send high-quality masks and rapid tests to school districts that request them. Already, schools in Kentucky and Texas have closed, citing widespread respiratory illness among students and staff.","The coronavirus is in the air again. Literally.","A steady uptick in cases since July and reports of worrisome new variants have fueled concern that the virus is poised to make a comeback this fall and winter. But in interviews, experts offered reassurances that the country will not see a return to the nightmarish scenarios of previous years.","There is no evidence that any of the variants in circulation cause more severe disease or evade immunity adroitly enough to render vaccines ineffective. And although hospitalizations and deaths are increasing week by week, the numbers remain low, noted Gigi Gronvall, a biosecurity expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.","“These increases are more alarming by statistics than in reality,” Dr. Gronvall said. Hospital admissions for Covid increased by about 16 percent in the week ending Aug. 26, compared with the previous week. But the 17,400 new admissions were less than half the number in the same period last year, and about one-fifth the number in 2021.","Deaths from Covid increased by nearly 18 percent over the previous week, but the numbers remained relatively low, averaging just over 600 deaths per week in August, compared with about 3,000 per week in late August 2022, and about 14,000 per week in late August 2021.","“What I think we’re seeing is the virus continuing to evolve, and then leading to waves of infection, hopefully mostly mild in severity,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, head of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.","At the moment, the numbers suggest that Americans should tailor their behavior to their own risks, some experts said.","Those who are the most vulnerable to Covid — older adults, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems — might well choose to take the utmost precautions, such as masking most or all of the time and avoiding crowded indoor spaces.","Those with reduced risk may want to take precautions in some circumstances, especially if they might pass the virus to more vulnerable people. Stay up-to-date on Covid shots, Dr. Gronvall said, and get Paxlovid, the antiviral treatment, if you become infected and qualify.","Though most scientists are cautiously optimistic, it is difficult to predict what will happen in the next few months because of two factors: the vaccines and the variants.","The Biden administration has said that rather than periodic boosters, Americans now should expect to receive a single Covid shot each fall, much like the annual flu vaccine. This year’s Covid vaccines may be available as early as next week, when advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are scheduled to review data and issue recommendations for use.","(Regulators in the European Union and Britain have already approved the updated vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech for use in everyone 6 months and older.)The shots will be available for free to most Americans through private insurers and through a new federal program for uninsured people. But it’s unclear how many Americans will opt for vaccination. As of May 2023, fewer than half of adults older than 65, and just about one in five American adults overall, had opted for the bivalent booster shot offered last fall.","The updated vaccines target XBB.1.5, a virus variant that was dominant earlier this year when federal officials had to settle on a formulation. But since then, that variant has been superseded by several close relatives.","Limited surveillance suggests that the most prevalent variant is now EG.5, nicknamed Eris, which accounts for about 22 percent of cases. EG.5 is also circulating widely in many European countries, including Britain, and in Asia. It may be more transmissible than XBB.1.5 and can sidestep the body’s immune defenses, but only partly.","“That’s why we’re not seeing EG.5 sweeping crazily fast across the globe,” said Yunlong Cao, a researcher at Peking University, who analyzed the variant.","EG.5 and another virus variant, FL.1.5.1, which accounts for about 15 percent of cases in the United States, both carry a genetic mutation that may help them not just dodge the immune system, but also bind more tightly to human cells.","But there is nothing unexpected or alarming about the coronavirus acquiring new mutations, said Andrew Read, an evolutionary microbiologist at Pennsylvania State University.","“When a mutation confers an interesting new trick that’s got an advantage, it’s going to be popping up in many different places,” Dr. Read said. “Everything we see is just consistent with how you imagine virus evolution proceeding in a situation where a new virus has jumped into a novel host population.”Yet one variant initially caused some consternation among scientists: BA.2.86, nicknamed Pirola.","“It captured people’s attention because it emerged in 10 countries simultaneously, and it contains over 30 mutations in the spike protein,” Dr. Barouch said. “And so there was a substantial worry that it might be a drastic shift toward increased antibody evasion.”But recent data from several teams, including one led by Dr. Barouch, have put those fears to rest. The studies showed that BA.2.86 did not dodge immunity from infection or vaccination.","And BA.2.86’s prevalence is so minor that, so far, it barely makes the C.D.C.’s catalog of variants spreading in the country. Even so, “I think we still need to remain vigilant, because BA.2.86 likely will continue to evolve,” Dr. Barouch said.","Each mutation “needs to be evaluated vigorously and rigorously and as quickly as possible,” he said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/health/covid-deaths-hospitalizations-vaccines.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/07/science/07covid/07covid-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-07 09:00:14+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:01.524656+00');

coronavirus was so poor that it violated residents’ constitutional rights, according to a U.S. Department of Justice report released Thursday.","The veterans’ homes in Edison and Paramus experienced some of the country’s highest coronavirus death rates. In the first five months of the pandemic, at least 146 patients died at the long-term care facilities after contracting Covid-19.","The report grew out of a three-year investigation and offered a scathing assessment of a broad range of problems within the two homes, including no-show supervisors, indifference to residents’ discomfort, a culture of fear and a lack of regard for employee safety.","It also found that the inadequate care continued even after the pandemic abated, which is likely to embolden critics of New Jersey’s Democratic governor, Philip D. Murphy, as he seeks to expand his national profile.","Mr. Murphy’s handling of the pandemic, particularly in nursing homes, has long been seen as a political vulnerability — one that was used as a cudgel during his campaign for re-election in 2021.","In a statement Thursday, he noted that his administration had taken steps to improve the nursing homes, including hiring private managers to help run them. He acknowledged that the federal findings were a “deeply disturbing reminder that the treatment received by our heroic veterans is unacceptable and, quite frankly, appalling.”“It is clear,” he added, “that we have significantly more work to do.”Determining a remedy, however, is no longer solely up to state leaders.","The Justice Department has ordered New Jersey’s Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which runs the facilities, to immediately address the “deficient basic medical care” for its frail and vulnerable patients.","“The current risks to residents extend beyond infection control,” the 43-page report stated, noting that the nursing homes had also failed to properly administer medicine, safeguard residents from falling or treat wounds.","The Justice Department concluded that the existing conditions violated a guarantee of reasonable care and safety for veterans in state-run facilities. It ordered New Jersey to provide better infection control at the homes, which continue to have high mortality rates, as well as improve data collection and staff accountability, among other measures.","Kristen Clarke, an assistant attorney general with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said that the investigation, which began in October 2020, showed that deficient care had “caused these veterans and their families great harm.”“We owe the veterans who served our nation our deepest thanks, and those veterans and their family members who live in these facilities have the right to appropriate care,” Ms. Clarke said in a statement.","Regina Costantino Discenza, whose parents died during the first year of the pandemic at Menlo Park Veterans Memorial Home in Edison, said the report confirmed what veterans’ relatives already knew.","“It’s nice that the D.O.J. finally drew some conclusions — conclusions that were obvious to family members,” she said. “Let’s hope the Murphy administration makes the right changes.”The report made clear that the deficiencies could not be blamed entirely on the extraordinary challenges that nursing homes across the country faced as the virus swept through long-term care centers.","“Even by the standards of the pandemic’s difficult early days, the facilities were unprepared to keep their residents safe,” the report said.","Before the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, an average of 100 residents died annually in each of the two nursing homes. In April 2020 alone, 98 residents at the Menlo Park facility and 92 residents of the Paramus home died, federal investigators found.","Not all succumbed to Covid-19. But the report found that the numbers of deaths the state has officially linked to Covid to date — 94 at Paramus and 80 at Menlo Park — are most likely a vast undercount, given poor record-keeping and the number of people who died without being tested for the virus.","New Jersey, like most states, operates several large nursing homes for veterans. The three facilities, which are reserved for residents who have served in the military and their close relatives, each can care for about 300 people at a time. They currently house roughly 570 patients.","A veterans’ home in Vineland, in southern New Jersey, experienced far fewer Covid deaths and was not cited in the Justice Department report.","The Justice Department offered a damning assessment of care during the early days of the pandemic, when exceptionally high numbers of deaths at the homes drew widespread attention from federal lawmakers and news outlets, as well as in the months and years that followed.","At Paramus, a top official responsible for supervising the nursing staff worked remotely for months in 2021 and 2022 — “without participating in regular meetings or otherwise appearing to perform her normal duties,” federal investigators found.","At Menlo Park, a worker told investigators that she had watched as a resident with a high fever screamed and ripped out his oxygen tube.","“When she reported the incident to another nurse on the unit,” the report said, “the nurse responded that she should mind her own business because the nurse was finishing her shift.”Employees also suffered because of poor management, the report concluded, and faced discipline in the early weeks of the pandemic for wearing masks in hallways or in “any circumstance other than during direct contact with symptomatic residents.”“The residents are being herded from unit to unit,” a nurse complained to an administrator in an April 2020 email. “Covid-19 is all over the building on every unit. It’s spreading like wildfire.”“Where is the concern for staff?” she added.","The administrator dismissed her claims, writing about her, “She’s ridiculous.”At least three employees of the veterans’ homes died after contracting the virus, according to state records.","Early last year, the state offered a sober but indirect acknowledgment of its failings when it agreed to pay $53 million to the families of 119 veterans who lived in the two facilities.","The families had been preparing to file lawsuits that accused the state of gross negligence, and the out-of-court settlement was the first of its kind nationwide.","Months later, Massachusetts agreed to pay $56 million to resolve claims that the leaders of a state-run nursing home for veterans showed deliberate indifference during a coronavirus outbreak that was linked to the deaths of 84 residents early in the pandemic.","Cynthia Petersen’s 94-year-old father has lived at the Paramus home since 2019, and has twice contracted Covid.","“There’s nurses that are great and they call me and they’re wonderful,” Ms. Petersen said.","Still, she said, families were recently alerted to a new outbreak of a respiratory virus, and reading Thursday’s report left her feeling “a little furious.”“I know that they can’t control everything,” Ms. Petersen said. “But where is the infection control? And what did they learn?”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/nyregion/nursing-homes-neglect-veterans-rights.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/07/nyregion/07nj-veterans-01/07nj-veterans-01-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-07 17:42:29+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:02.063762+00');

'By Christina Jewett and Noah Weiland', 'health', '["The Food and Drug Administration approved a new round of Covid boosters on Monday, that will arrive alongside the seasonal flu vaccine and shots to protect infants and older adults from R.S.V., a potentially lethal respiratory virus.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to follow up on Tuesday with an advisory meeting to discuss who should get the new shots, by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. After a final decision by the C.D.C.’s director, millions of doses will be shipped to pharmacies, clinics and health systems nationwide within days.","As Covid cases creep up, the trifecta of prevention measures could portend the first winter of the decade without a crush of patients overwhelming some hospitals. But a healthy winter is far from a lock: In the last year, the updated Covid vaccine made it into the arms of only 20 percent of adults in the United States.","Some experts view that statistic with little alarm because the number of Covid deaths slowed considerably over the last year, thanks to an increasingly immune population and higher vaccine rates among older Americans. Others see this year as an opportunity to protect more vulnerable people from severe illness or death.","“Vaccination remains critical to public health and continued protection against serious consequences of Covid-19, including hospitalization and death,” said Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A’s top vaccine expert.","The F.D.A. granted full approval for the new formulas for people who are 12 and older and authorized them to protect infants six months and older through age 11. The Pfizer shot was authorized in the European Union for ages 6 months and older on Aug. 31.","Covid vaccines are just rolling out in the United Kingdom this week, with the first doses going to the highest risk people in care homes, ages 65 and over as well as health and social care staff members.","Federal officials have been retreating from labeling the new formulation as boosters to previous shots, preferring to recast them as an annual immunization effort akin to the flu vaccine. That shift may reflect concern over the fatigue that some Americans have expressed about yet another round of shots against the virus.","The vaccine campaign will also be the first since the end of the public health emergency, which expired in May. In previous years, the U.S. government bought hundreds of millions of vaccine doses and distributed them for free. This year, private insurance and government payers like Medicare that cover the vast majority of Americans are expected to provide the vaccines to people for free.","But the question remains whether the private market of hospitals, clinics and pharmacies will be able to calibrate their vaccine orders to stock a realistic supply. Experts are uncertain how much demand there will be for the latest shots.","“There could be a period in here where things are a little bit chaotic, and that’s never a good situation,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a public health group.","Also of concern in the handoff to the private market: the nation’s 23 million adults with no health insurance. The Biden administration has made plans to cover costs and offer the Covid vaccine through local clinics and major pharmacies, but some experts are worried about whether people who lack insurance will be aware of the new shots — or where to get them.","“They don’t have an insurer sending them leaflets — they may not have a usual source of care,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a California advocacy group. “And so the trusted messenger of their health plan, their doctor, their clinic, is not there saying, ‘It’s no cost. It’s really easy.’”Vaccine manufacturers are expected to donate doses for the uninsured. Kelly Cunningham, a spokeswoman for Moderna, said the company had no cap on the number.","The latest shots are becoming available as Covid hospitalizations and deaths are rising slightly, albeit not to the levels of past years. In the week ending Aug. 26, there were 17,400 people admitted to the hospital — more than about 6,000 at a low point this summer. Deaths were also up to about 600 a week last month, though far lower than the weekly average of 14,000 deaths of 2021.","Once the C.D.C. signs off, the Biden administration plans to urge the public to get their Covid and flu shots at the same time, a practice that has been studied and considered by some experts to be safe. It’s a messaging effort they expect to share with major vaccine makers, which will be marketing the Covid doses commercially for the first time.","Walgreens and CVS said they both already have the updated flu and R.S.V. shots available in stores. Dr. Kevin Ban, Walgreens’ chief medical officer, said the chain would have the new Covid shots on hand “as soon as possible.” A CVS spokesperson said doses could be arriving later this week. Representatives of both chains said the Covid shot would be available at no cost to all who are eligible under the C.D.C. guidelines expected Tuesday.","Targeted populations most certainly will include people 65 and older as well as those who are immunocompromised or have serious underlying medical conditions that leave them more susceptible to severe illness from the virus.","Nursing homes, which inoculated nearly all of their residents in the first waves of the pandemic, have fallen behind on booster rates: Recent Medicare data show that about 62 percent of residents are up-to-date on their shots even though older adults are among the most vulnerable to severe disease and death from the virus.","The new Covid vaccines target the XBB.1.5 variant, which was dominant when vaccine makers began to formulate and test a new version. They are monovalent because, unlike the earlier boosters, they do not include protection against the original virus that caused widespread infections in China more than three years ago. Though the virus has had a rotating cast of variants, experts say the new Covid jab should fortify protections against severe infection.","Recent fears that one newer, highly mutated variant would escape the vaccine proved unfounded by reputable independent labs, said Fikadu Tafesse, an associate professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Oregon Health & Science University. The C.D.C. also reviewed studies on the matter and confirmed Friday that the vaccine was holding strong.","“We were really getting ready for no response at all, but the data is very, very promising,” Dr. Tafesse said.","As with earlier shots, the updated ones are not expected to eliminate the chances of contracting a mild case of Covid. Instead, they are expected to reduce the chances of severe illness, hospitalization or death. As the first vaccine’s potency waned with newer Omicron variants, a bivalent booster was approved in August 2022 that targeted the initial virus and BA.5, which was dominant at the time. That shot led to fewer people with Covid being hospitalized, dropping over several months to 25 percent from 60 percent.","Pfizer and Moderna reported that their vaccines had a potent response to the newest circulating variants, though only Moderna posted its initial data on Thursday.","But researchers continue to discuss how well it will stand up to new variants. The F.D.A. has mainly reviewed results submitted by the companies of animal or smaller human studies of immune response.","Jerica Pitts, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said the data submitted by the company to the F.D.A. in June involved tests in animals. Trials following people who received the shot are continuing, she said.","Moderna submitted data to the F.D.A. on the immune response of 100 people to the new shots, which the company said in June “robustly elicit neutralizing antibodies” against XBB variants.","Federal officials would also need to consider whether to recommend the shot to healthy young Americans, said Dr. Walid Gellad, a drug safety expert at the University of Pittsburgh.","Young males have experienced higher rates of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, after getting vaccinated, although many recovered after a few months.","“The benefits are just getting lower and lower for young healthy people who’ve had Covid before,” he said. “You have to think about how any risk can change that balance.”Regulators are also considering whether to authorize a booster dose from Novavax, which employs a different but widely used technology for its coronavirus vaccine. Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease physician at Columbia University in New York, said getting the Covid shot would help stop the virus’s spread to the most vulnerable, including older adults, pregnant people and those with compromised immune systems.","And while many might be weary of the social-protection argument, he said they could lessen their own odds of a more serious outcome.","“So a younger individual may say, ‘I’m not going to get a booster for the public health,’” Dr. Griffin said, “‘but I am going to get a booster because if I can reduce my chance of getting Covid, I can reduce my chance of long Covid.’”Carl Zimmer and Apoorva Mandavilli contributed to this report."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/health/covid-vaccine-boosters-fda-pfizer-moderna.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/11/science/11FDA-VACCINE/11FDA-VACCINE-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-11 09:02:36+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:02.401197+00');

reviving its program of offering Americans free coronavirus tests through the mail and would spend $600 million to buy tests from a dozen domestic manufacturers.","The website for the program, covidtests.gov, will begin accepting orders on Monday, and households will receive four tests. Dawn O’Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the money would fund the purchase of 200 million tests to replenish the nation’s stockpile as tests are sent out.","But a byproduct of the program, Ms. O’Connell said, is that it will shore up domestic manufacturing capacity in the event of another serious coronavirus surge. And if there is a spike in demand, she said, the department has given the manufacturers permission to sell the tests directly to retailers ahead of the government.","Coronavirus hospitalizations have been on the rise in the United States, though they remain low compared with earlier stretches of the pandemic, and free tests are now harder to come by for many Americans. While private insurers had previously been required to cover up to eight at-home tests per month, that requirement ended when the Biden administration allowed the public health emergency for the coronavirus to expire in May.","The administration first began offering free at-home coronavirus tests through the Postal Service early last year after the Omicron variant caused cases to soar. More than 600 million tests were distributed before officials halted the program late that summer, citing a lack of funding. The administration then resumed offering tests late last year before halting the program again this spring.","The announcement on Wednesday came as President Biden’s health secretary, Xavier Becerra, tried to drum up interest in the newly approved coronavirus vaccines by getting his own Covid and flu shots at a CVS pharmacy in Washington. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last week that all Americans 6 months and older receive at least one dose of the reformulated Covid vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.","With the chief executives of Pfizer and Moderna standing beside him, Mr. Becerra invoked his own mother, who is about to turn 90 and, he said, has not had Covid-19.","“I feel comfortable, having gotten the shots, that I could hug and kiss my mother and not be responsible for getting her sick,” he said, adding, “No one is safe until everyone is safe.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/us/politics/free-covid-tests-biden.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/20/multimedia/20dc-virus-tests-mzbj/20dc-virus-tests-mzbj-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 19:08:43+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:02.853754+00');

published on Thursday.","The research is the final trial conducted by MAPS Public Benefit Corporation, a company that is developing prescription psychedelics. It plans to submit the results to the Food and Drug Administration as part of an application for approval to market MDMA, the psychedelic drug, as a treatment for PTSD, when paired with talk therapy.","If approved, “MDMA-assisted therapy would be the first novel treatment for PTSD in over two decades,” said Berra Yazar-Klosinski, the senior author of the study, which was published in Nature Medicine, and the chief scientific officer at the company. “PTSD patients can feel some hope.”PTSD affects about 5 percent of the adult population of the United States each year. But conventional therapies and medications only help, at best, around 50 percent of patients, said Dr. Stephen Xenakis, a psychiatrist and the executive director of the American Psychedelic Practitioners Association, who was not involved in the study.","“My clinical experience is that too many men and women have lost hope with conventional treatments and therapies and feel the only ‘out’ for them is committing suicide,” Dr. Xenakis said. “We need to do something more to help them, and MDMA-assisted therapy offers a new, potentially lifesaving option when done thoughtfully and professionally.”MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or Molly, has been an illegal substance since 1985, when the Drug Enforcement Administration classified it as a Schedule 1 drug, placing it in the highest category for controlled drugs that the agency deems of no medical use and that have a high potential for abuse.","Before that, MDMA was administered by an estimated hundreds of therapists in North America and Europe for couples counseling, personal growth and to address trauma.","“The big tragedy to point out is that it was pretty clear in the late 1970s and early 1980s that MDMA had incredible therapeutic potential,” said Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit group that owns MAPS PBC. “All the suffering since then, because MDMA was criminalized, is enormous.”MAPS has been advocating the legalization of MDMA-assisted therapy since 1986, and supporting research of its use in treating PTSD since 2001. The Heffter Research Institute, another nonprofit group, has been doing the same for psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, since 1993.","The F.D.A. in 2017 granted “breakthrough therapy” status to MDMA-assisted therapy as a treatment for PTSD. The designation allows the development of promising experimental drugs to be fast-tracked. Psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression was granted breakthrough status in 2018.","The 104 participants in the new study had been diagnosed with moderate to severe PTSD and had lived with the condition for an average of 16 years. They included victims of childhood trauma, combat veterans, survivors of sexual assault and others. Many had a history of suicidal thoughts and also suffered from comorbidities such as depression and alcohol use disorder.","Each participant worked with a two-person therapy team and received three 90-minute preparatory, talk therapy sessions followed by three treatment cycles, spaced one month apart. Each consisted of an eight-hour experimental session in which the participant took either MDMA or a placebo paired with talk therapy, and then attended three 90-minute talk therapy sessions.","During the experimental sessions, 53 participants were given MDMA and 51 were given an inactive placebo. Neither the therapists nor the participants were informed which patients had received the MDMA.","The participants in the group that were given MDMA experienced significantly greater reductions in their PTSD symptoms compared with those in the group that were given a placebo, according to the research article.","By the end of the study, 86.5 percent of people in the MDMA group achieved a measurable reduction in severity of symptoms, researchers reported. About 71 percent in the MDMA group improved enough that they no longer met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. Of those who took the placebo, 69 percent improved and nearly 48 percent no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis.","The findings were similar to the results of the first Phase 3 study of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, published in Nature Medicine in 2021. For the 90 participants in that study, 67 percent in the group given MDMA no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis two months after treatment, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group.","One notable difference in the most recent study was the diversity of participants, said Jennifer Mitchell, a neuroscientist at the University of California San Francisco and the lead author of both studies.","More than a quarter of the participants in the new study were Hispanic or Latino and about 34 percent were nonwhite, whereas about 9 percent of participants in the 2021 study were Hispanic or Latino and 22 percent were nonwhite.","“We worked long and hard to get a study population that’s more in line with the general population with PTSD,” Dr. Mitchell said. “This isn’t just privileged people with lots of time and resources.”The increase in participant diversity coincided with an increase in the number of therapists of color, to 28 percent in the new study, up from 11 percent in 2021. MAPS PBC said it also offered participants transportation to and from study sites as well as stipends to make up for lost wages or to cover child or elder care.","The diversity of participants is “certainly an improvement over prior studies,” said Albert Garcia-Romeu, a psychopharmacologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who was not involved in the research. But he added that “it will be critical to see more Black and Indigenous folks enrolled, considering the substantial health disparities these groups face.”As in previous studies of MDMA-assisted therapy, the treatment was generally well-tolerated, according to the data presented about adverse events. Common side effects, primarily for those in the MDMA group, included muscle tightness, nausea, decreased appetite and sweating.","Two participants in the MDMA group and one in the placebo group experienced serious suicidal ideation during the study, but no suicide attempts were reported.","“People in both groups had certain adverse events that would be concerning, like suicidality, at comparable rates, though it’s notable that most people in the study were already struggling with those challenges beforehand,” Dr. Garcia-Romeu said.","Seven participants overall also experienced cardiovascular issues, including faster heartbeats. According to Dr. Paul Summergrad, a professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine who was not involved in the research, while these events “were generally not severe,” they might indicate that a cardiologist should evaluate older patients or ones with known heart problems before treatment with MDMA.","MAPS PBC said it had worked closely with the F.D.A. to determine the study methods and the number of participants needed to assess the safety and efficacy of the new treatment.","Most participants correctly guessed whether they had received a placebo or MDMA. This is a typical challenge across psychiatry research and is something “the authors acknowledge and did everything possible to mitigate,” said Dr. Steven Zalcman, chief of the adult pathophysiology and biological interventions development branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, who was not involved in the research.","The researchers are now working on a follow-up study examining the long-term durability of the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy. Findings from Phase 2 studies sponsored by MAPS indicated that the benefits lasted at least 12 months for most participants who received the drug.","MAPS PBC plans to submit a new drug application to the F.D.A. seeking approval for MDMA-assisted therapy. The agency, which does not comment on pending drug reviews, could reach a decision within a year.","Some outside experts said they did not believe the study’s results would meet the F.D.A.’s criteria for approval.","“The benefits in the active group were really not much greater than the benefits in the placebo group,” said Dr. Allen Frances, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University. “MDMA treatment would add huge costs to the treatment system while providing only a small, specific benefit — and thus result in a massive misallocation of already very scarce resources.”Dr. Akua Prieto Brown, the medical director of Alchemy Community Therapy Center in Oakland, Calif., who also was not involved in the study, criticized this “scarcity mind-set,” however, and said that the focus for health care professionals should instead be “on increasing treatment options for a condition that is notoriously difficult to treat.”Disagreements among mental health practitioners are to be expected, Dr. Xenakis said, adding that “tectonic shifts of this dimension are disruptive and can produce more fractures among the professionals than agreement.”Federal approval for MDMA-assisted therapy would also mean the drug would have to receive a less serious ranking for controlled substances by the D.E.A. and from states.","Therapist training is another potential bottleneck. The company already oversees its own therapist education program and is working with other partners, including universities, to increase training.","The specific standards and requirements that the F.D.A. might seek from prescribers, and what the agency would outline for the labeling instructions of MDMA-assisted therapy, are still open questions, said Amy Emerson, the chief executive of MAPS PBC.","“Drug-assisted therapy hasn’t been approved before, so there’s not a lot of precedent,” she said.","The company has not yet set a price for the drug, Ms. Emerson said, and it will not manage how much the therapy component will cost.","But it is contacting insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare to try to secure coverage, Ms. Emerson said. The group is also working on patient access programs to help those who do not have coverage and who cannot pay out of pocket to receive discounts or even free treatment.","Given the hurdles that still lay ahead, “it feels a bit too early to really celebrate,” Dr. Doblin said. “But it’s been a long, long process, and it’s amazing that we are this far.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/health/mdma-ptsd-psychedelics.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/14/multimedia/14MDMA-PTSD-01-wtfj/14MDMA-PTSD-01-wtfj-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-14 15:00:19+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:06.655864+00');

had a mop of curly red hair and Bill Clinton had just become president.","By the time opposition to the drug had coalesced, Dr. Hendeles was appearing, at age 80, as an expert to testify before the agency’s advisers, his hair white and his overview of the ingredient spanning 50 years.","His advocacy culminated in the advisory panel’s unanimous vote on Tuesday, when it concluded that the decongestant, a common ingredient in cold and flu remedies, is ineffective.","Prompted by the news, consumers threw open their medicine cabinets upon learning that the decongestant, phenylephrine, was listed in more than 250 of their go-to drugs for congestion like some versions of DayQuil, Sudafed, Tylenol and Theraflu. And the decision has caused some confusion — experts say the ingredient still works in nasal sprays, just not when taken orally in pill or liquid form.","Given that the drug is considered safe, experts say there is no need to throw away the products, which contain other ingredients that do work.","Nothing will change immediately. F.D.A. officials have to review the panel’s decision, solicit public comments and most likely will give drug makers some time to adjust or swap out ingredients rather than face a decision to strip store shelves of so many consumer staples. Other delays could occur if the companies contest the actions in court. And some experts, notably Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former F.D.A. commissioner, have long maintained that phenylephrine does work, to some extent. Some defenders of the drug may try to oppose any action that banishes the decongestant altogether.","But how phenylephrine stayed on the market this long despite decades of studies and questions is a tangled story involving old drug standards dating back to a law signed by President Kennedy, the proliferation of meth labs using everyday cold remedies in the 1990s, and even the pandemic.","Like other federal agencies, the F.D.A. can move glacially, at times hampered by antiquated rules and a morass of regulatory procedures.","“There is no question that regulation of over-the-counter medications was broken for many years,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former agency official and vice dean at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins. The latest moves, he said, indicate that the “agency is only now getting its handcuffs off.”One could argue the process of dissecting phenylephrine — a drug used for dilating eyes and calming hemorrhoids — took roughly six decades. The Kennedy era had ushered in a new law that required the F.D.A. to evaluate a drug’s effectiveness in addition to existing safety standards.","It wasn’t until 1976 that the F.D.A. began reviews of over-the-counter cold medicines, like phenylephrine, as a class of drugs.","But by the early 1990s, the decongestant still hadn’t received a full approval, and the lengthy delays had attracted the attention of Dr. Hendeles and a group of pharmacy professors at the University of Florida.","They would become the one constant in the last 30 years of phenylephrine’s history by putting pressure on the F.D.A. to do something.","Dr. Hendeles published his first critique of the drug in 1993, noting that the agency had oversight of two more popular decongestants that were effective and a third that was not: phenylephrine. The medication was meant to constrict blood vessels and clear congestion in the nose. But it was destroyed in the stomach, he wrote in a medical journal. That meant most of the medication didn’t make it to the bloodstream — much less to the nose.","By the 2000s, what would seem like an unrelated problem was surging: Illegal methamphetamine labs in rural areas on the West Coast were exploding, as was abuse of the illicit drug.","Meth cooks’ ingredient of choice was one of the most common decongestants on the market at the time, pseudoephedrine, which could be found at any drugstore.","By then, it was one of two decongestants available for congestion relief; a third had been pulled in 2000 after studies tied it to strokes.","The meth crisis prompted the passage of state and federal laws to restrict sales of products containing pseudoephedrine, and consumers had to show identification and sign a ledger to buy it from behind the counter or a locked cabinet of a pharmacy.","Concerned about losing sales, companies with medicines containing the popular meth additive turned to the last option authorized by the F.D.A.: phenylephrine.","Dr. Hendeles said he was dismayed to see the ingredient in medicines lining pharmacy shelves, knowing patients were complaining that the replacement didn’t help them at all.","He teamed up with a colleague, Dr. Randall Hatton, and they dug deeper, plumbing the data used in the 1970s for the drug’s initial approval.","Dr. Hatton unearthed memos to the F.D.A. from the 1960s and 1970s that had not been peer-reviewed. He and colleagues ran the data in modern analysis software and concluded that the drug was no better than a placebo.","As their research progressed, Dr. Hendeles tried to reach the F.D.A., where he had once been a visiting scientist. He was not breaking through, he said. So he turned to the office of U.S. Representative Henry Waxman, a crusading California lawmaker, for help.","Mr. Waxman fired off four letters, citing the professors’ findings and imploring the agency to act. “F.D.A. has a duty to arm Americans with the information they need so that they don’t waste their hard-earned money on medicines that do not work,” he wrote in a letter in 2006.","The F.D.A. replied that same year, restating the findings of its 1976 decision. The letter suggested that if a consumer did not get relief from phenylephrine, “they have the option of not purchasing it.”Dr. Hendeles, the letter said, was free to petition the agency.","And he did. Dr. Hendeles requested a dosing review and examination of use of the drug for children. That led to a public F.D.A. advisory hearing in 2007. There, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the business trade group that represents the makers of over-the-counter medicine, maintained that the drug worked.","Dr. Hendeles recalled what he considered show-stopper testimony. Representatives for Schering Plough, at the time the maker of Claritin-D, which contained the restricted decongestant pseuodoephedrine, told advisers that they had studied its rival, phenylephrine, and found it had no effect. The company’s newspaper ads touted its “bold move” to keep the “powerful formula” for Claritin-D, a letter by Mr. Waxman noted.","Still, the advisory committee voted 11 to 1 that “evidence is supportive” that phenylephrine “may be effective,” and called for more research.","Eight years passed.","Then Dr. Hendeles and colleagues pounced on a study that emerged from Merck, which had acquired Schering Plough. The company examined the drug at the authorized dose and at a dose four times as high, and again found it did not relieve symptoms. Merck also funded a study on a slow-release formula.","But that stubborn head complaint — congestion — did not budge.","(In 2014, Merck sold Claritin-D, which still contains pseudoephedrine, to Bayer.)The Florida pharmacists petitioned the agency for a ban, using the latest study as ammunition. But their efforts were stymied by what many former agency officials described as a beleaguered over-the-counter division, which had 31 staff members in 2018.","The staff had to follow “an arcane process that handcuffed the agency and provided insufficient resources to clear a backlog,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, who was an associate commissioner at the agency through 2017.","The Florida team ran into other hurdles throughout the years.","After this week’s vote, in posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, Dr. Gottlieb, who was the agency’s commissioner from 2017 to early 2019, called the panel’s decision “a shame.”  He recalled that phenylephrine “was believed to be weakly active when we looked at this question around 2005/06. Now there may be no good, cheap, accessible options for consumers to get incremental relief.”In an interview on Friday, Dr. Gottlieb said he thought more study of the ingredient was needed. “I think it’s premature to say that it doesn’t work,” he said.","Interest in the decongestant was renewed after pandemic legislation expanded agency staffing and overhauled the F.D.A.’s procedures for over-the-counter drugs so that decisions would be more aligned with those in its prescription drug division.","Soon after, the F.D.A. team took up the longstanding issues with the decongestant, producing a painstaking, 89-page review of phenylephrine that the advisory panel combed as the basis for its decision. (The agency’s report confirmed the findings of Dr. Hendeles and his colleagues, and also noted apparent bias in some of the 1970s data that led to the drug’s initial acceptance.)“It was a joy to read,” Dr. Hendeles said.","When he testified before the panel earlier this week, Dr. Hendeles talked about a study from 1971 involving modified scuba masks to measure nasal congestion — the first finding phenylephrine to be a dud.","Other organizations including Public Citizen, the American College of Clinical Pharmacy and the National Center for Health Research also urged the panel to dispense with the ingredient. The industry association argued that the ingredient was effective and that low levels in the blood did not negate its effect. A statement from Kenvue, a spinoff of Johnson & Johnson, said products with phenylephrine are a small part of its business and it sells cold products without it.","When agency advisers cast their 16-to-0 vote, Dr. Hendeles was thrilled. “Nothing was as exciting and exhilarating as the vote,” he said.","Lawyers representing people who purchased cold and flu medicines containing phenylephrine are already announcing lawsuits against the drug makers, claiming the companies knew the decongestant was useless.","For now, the products remain on the shelves. “We feel vindicated for something that we worked on for a long time,” Dr. Hatton said. “But it’s not over.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/health/fda-cold-medicine-decongestant.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/18/multimedia/18-JP-FDA-COLD-MEDS-03-PRINT/15FDA-COLDMEDS-01-pcqm-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-15 20:24:29+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:07.223774+00');

She had beaten back Stage 4 lymphoma with such aggressive chemotherapy and other treatments that at one point she grew too weak to stand, and relied on a wheelchair. She endured several hospitalizations, suffered infections and lost nearly 20 pounds. But she prevailed.","Ms. Govatos, 79, a retired executive at nonprofit organizations who lives in Wilmington, Del., has been grateful for the extra years. “I feel incredibly fortunate,” she said. She has been able to take and teach lifelong learning courses, to work in her garden, to visit London and Cape Cod with friends. She spends time with her two grandchildren, “an elixir.”But she knows that the cancer may well return, and she doesn’t want to endure the pain and disability of further attempts to vanquish it.","“I’m not looking to be treated to death. I want quality of life,” she told her oncologist. “If that means less time alive, that’s OK.” When her months dwindle, she wants medical aid in dying. After a series of requests and consultations, a doctor would prescribe a lethal dose of a medication that she would take on her own.","Aid in dying remains illegal in Delaware, despite repeated legislative attempts to pass a bill permitting it. Since 2019, however, it has been legal in neighboring New Jersey, a half-hour drive from Ms. Govatos’s home.","But New Jersey restricts aid in dying to terminally ill residents of its own state. Ms. Govatos was more than willing, therefore, to become one of four plaintiffs — two patients, two doctors — taking New Jersey officials to federal court.","The lawsuit, filed last month, argues that New Jersey’s residency requirement violates the Constitution’s privileges and immunities clause and its equal protection clause.","“The statute prohibits New Jersey physicians from providing equal care to their non-New Jersey resident patients,” said David Bassett, a lawyer with the New York firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, which brought the suit with the advocacy group Compassion & Choices.","“There’s no justification that anyone has articulated” for such discrimination, he added. The suit also contends that forbidding New Jersey doctors to offer aid-in-dying care to out-of-state patients restricts interstate commerce, the province of Congress.","The New Jersey Attorney General’s office declined to comment.","“I’d like not to die in horrible pain and horrible fear, and I’ve experienced both,” Ms. Govatos said. Even if she enrolls in hospice, many of the pain medications used cause her to pass out, hallucinate and vomit.","To be able to legally end her life when she decides to “is a question of mercy and kindness,” she said.","It’s the third time that Compassion & Choices has pursued this route in its efforts to broaden access to aid in dying. It filed similar suits in Oregon in 2021 and in Vermont last year. Both states agreed to settle, and their legislatures passed revised statutes repealing residency requirements, Oregon in July and Vermont in May.","The plaintiffs hope New Jersey, another blue state, will follow suit. “We hope we never have to go before a judge. Our preference is to negotiate an equitable resolution,” Mr. Bassett said. “That’s what’s important for our patient plaintiffs. They don’t have time for full-fledged litigation.”“It’s not the traditional process of trying to convince a state legislature that this is a good idea,” said Thaddeus Pope, a law professor at Mitchell-Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minn., who tracks end-of-life laws and court cases.","Dropping residency requirements in New Jersey could have a far greater impact than it will in Oregon or Vermont. The sheer population density along New Jersey’s borders — there are almost 20 million residents in the New York metropolitan area alone — means medical aid in dying would suddenly become available to vastly more people, and much more quickly than it would through legislation.","With a major airport and direct flights, “it’s easier to get to Newark than Burlington, Vermont,” Mr. Pope pointed out.","Many states where aid in dying is legal have relaxed their statutes because of findings like those in a 2017 study, in which about a third of California patients who asked a doctor about aid in dying either died before they could complete the process or became too ill to continue it.","But New Jersey still uses the stricter series of steps that Oregon first codified in 1994. That means two verbal requests to a doctor at least 15 days apart, a written request with two witnesses, and a consultation with a second physician; both must confirm that the patient is eligible. There’s a 48-hour wait after the written request before a prescription can be written.","Even without having to establish residency, “it won’t be a walk in the park,” Mr. Pope said. “You can’t just pop over to New Jersey, pick up the drugs and go back.”Finding a doctor willing to prescribe can take time, as does using one of the state’s few compounding pharmacies, which combine the necessary drugs and fill the prescription.","Although no official would check to see whether patients travel home with the medication, both Mr. Bassett and Mr. Pope advise that the lethal dose ought to be taken in New Jersey, to avoid the possibility of family members facing prosecution in their home states for assisting in a suicide.","Still, preventing dying patients from having to sign leases and obtain government IDs in order to become residents will streamline the process. “Not everyone has the will, the financial means, the physical means” to establish residency, said Dr. Paul Bryman, one of the doctor plaintiffs and hospice medical director in southern New Jersey. “These are often very disabled people.”Bills recently introduced in Minnesota and New York don’t include residency requirements at all, Mr. Pope noted, since they seem likely to be challenged in court.","“I think the writing’s on the wall,” he said. “I think all the residency requirements will go, in all the states” where aid in dying is legal. There are 10, plus the District of Columbia (though the legality in Montana depends on a court decision, not legislation).","Despite the often heated wrangling over aid-in-dying laws, very few patients actually turn to lethal drugs in the end, state records show. Last year, Oregon reported that 431 people received prescriptions and 278 died by using them, just .6 percent of the state’s deaths in 2022.","In New Jersey, only 91 patients used aid in dying last year. Roughly a third of those who receive prescriptions never use them, perhaps sufficiently reassured by the prospect of a swift exit.","Fears of “death tourism,” with an onrush of out-of state patients, have not materialized, said John Burzichelli, a former state assemblyman who helped steer New Jersey’s statute through the legislature and now favors allowing eligible nonresidents to participate.","“I don’t see lines of people at the tollbooths coming to take advantage of this law,” he said.","If her cancer returns and New Jersey has balked at allowing out-of-staters to legally end their lives there, Ms. Govatos contemplates traveling to Vermont. She envisions a goodbye party for a few friends and family members, with poetry reading, music and “very good wine and lovely food.”But driving over the Delaware Memorial Bridge would be so much simpler. “It would be an incredible gift if I could go to New Jersey,” she said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/health/aid-in-dying-new-jersey.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/19SCI-SPAN-pqcb/19SCI-SPAN-pqcb-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-16 09:02:08+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:07.612206+00');

'By Gina Kolata', 'health', '["Tucker Marr’s life changed forever last October.","He was on his way to a wedding reception when he fell down a steep flight of metal stairs, banging the right side of his head so hard he went into a coma.","He’d fractured his skull, and a large blood clot formed on the left side of his head. Surgeons had to remove a large chunk of his skull to relieve pressure on his brain and to remove the clot.","“Getting a piece of my skull taken out was crazy to me,” Mr. Marr said. “I almost felt like I’d lost a piece of me.”But what seemed even crazier to him was the way that piece was restored.","Mr. Marr, a 27-year-old analyst at Deloitte, became part of a new development in neurosurgery. Instead of remaining without a piece of skull or getting the old bone put back, a procedure that is expensive and has a high rate of infection, he got a prosthetic piece of skull made with a 3-D printer. But it is not the typical prosthesis used in such cases. His prosthesis, which is covered by his skin, is embedded with an acrylic window that would let doctors peer into his brain with ultrasound.","A few medical centers are offering such acrylic windows to patients who had to have a piece of skull removed to treat conditions like a brain injury, a tumor, a brain bleed or hydrocephalus.","“It’s very cool,” Dr. Michael Lev, director of emergency radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, said. But, “it is still early days,” he added.","Advocates of the technique say that if a patient with such a window has a headache or a seizure or needs a scan to see if a tumor is growing, a doctor can slide an ultrasound probe on the patient’s head and look at the brain in the office. That way a patient can avoid costly, time-consuming and onerous CT scans or M.R.I.s. Instead of waiting for a radiologist to read the scan, a patient and a doctor can know right away what the patient’s brain looks like.","Dr. Mark Luciano, a professor of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, is using ultrasound to monitor hydrocephalus patients, who have shunts in their brains to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. Patients need regular CT scans to see if the fluid is draining properly.","In an attempt to assess the windows, Dr. Luciano recently published a study of 37 patients who had the windows placed in their skulls, compared with a larger group of similar patients from the year before the method was developed.","Over a one-year period, he saw no risk of infection. The challenge now, he said, is to make the images from ultrasound scans better and to quantify what they show, he said, as well as to monitor their safety for several years.","But not everyone is won over.","Dr. Ian McCutcheon, a professor of neurosurgery at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, said the window “is an intriguing idea.” But, he said, before he uses it to assess brain tumor patients he’d need evidence from a rigorous clinical trial that ultrasound is as accurate as an M.R.I. in detecting changes, like a growing tumor.","That trial, he said, “has not been done yet.”Others, like Dr. Joseph Watson, director of the brain tumor program at Georgetown University, called the technique “frivolous.”“You are going through a small port,” he said. “It doesn’t give you enough of a picture of the whole brain” that he gets with a CT scan or M.R.I.","But Mr. Marr’s doctor, Netanel Ben-Shalom, assistant professor of neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, disagrees. In his experience, he said, “as long as the window is located above the tumor, the cavity is clearly demonstrated.”Dr. Ben-Shalom was won over from the moment he tried implanting a window a few years ago. He was a resident at Johns Hopkins, and his patient had a brain tumor.","“It was amazing,” Dr. Ben-Shalom said. He could see the entire brain, he said, and all its structures.","He moved to Lenox Hill in January 2022, became a consultant for Longeviti, the company that makes the windows, and has been implanting and using its clear polymethylmethacrylate windows ever since.","On an afternoon earlier this year, Mr. Marr sat on a wooden chair in a tiny office at Lenox Hill, grinning as Dr. Ben-Shalom slid an ultrasound probe over the window in his skull. A cluster of medical students looked on.","For Mr. Marr, life was difficult after the removal of the piece of his skull to treat his swelling brain. His head was distorted, with a large dent. He was left with fatigue and dizziness because his brain was inadequately shielded from atmospheric pressure.","During the scan, Mr. Marr’s brain looked perfect, Dr. Ben-Shalom said. The midline that separates the two hemispheres — and which had been pushed to one side after Mr. Marr’s injury — was exactly where it should be. The structures of his brain looked normal, Dr. Ben-Shalom said. The ultrasound even showed his brain’s pulsing.","Mr. Marr is young and healthy but, Dr. Ben-Shalom said, anyone who has had brain surgery needs surveillance. If Mr. Marr comes in one day with nausea and vomiting or a severe headache, or if he had a seizure, his doctors would need to look at his brain. The acrylic window makes it easy, Dr. Ben-Shalom said.","At the University of Southern California, Dr. Charles Liu and his colleagues are taking the ultrasound idea a step further. In a research project, he is studying the use of ultrasound as a simpler and cheaper way to do the sort of studies now done with f.M.R.I., a method that uses M.R.I. scanners to examine the brain’s activity.","For the study, he needed a patient who required a skull restoration for medical reasons and who would volunteer to have one with a specially designed window. If the idea succeeded, he and the team thought they might some day be able to use the method on intact skulls.","The hope is to detect tiny signals from changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain as patients perform different activities. That, Dr. Liu said, “could give unprecedented insights into brain functions.”He found such a patient — Jared Hager, 39, who had a traumatic brain injury when he crashed his skateboard. He had spent two and a half years with a large piece of his skull missing.","Dr. Liu met Mr. Hager when he was admitted to Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey, Calif., part of the Los Angeles County public safety net health system.","When Dr. Liu met Mr. Hager, he was uninsured and homeless — he and his brother were living in a van. And Mr. Hager was missing a large chunk of skull. He was scheduled to have his skull restored, but Dr. Liu offered him a choice: a standard prosthesis or one with a specially designed window optimized for brain studies.","Before his surgery, the Rancho Los Amigos Foundation provided free housing at a facility next to the hospital for patients and their families. But Dr. Liu worried about what would happen after Mr. Hager was discharged.","“When you do this kind of surgery, it’s a big operation,” he said. “My goodness, what if we do surgery on this guy and he ends up in a van in downtown L.A.?”Through the Rancho Los Amigos Foundation Dr. Liu got Mr. Hager an apartment in Long Beach.","Mr. Hager has become a regular presence in Dr. Liu’s lab, working with its scientists to discover as much about his brain as they can.","“I’m never going to stop helping with anything Dr. Liu needs,” he said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/health/brain-surgery-skull-acrylic-window.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/06/multimedia/00brain-04-ptlg/00brain-04-ptlg-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-16 09:00:19+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:08.19378+00');

Mashpee River to a freshwater pond. It was three hours of paddling round trip, but afterward Mr. Houlihan, 83, felt no worse for wear — at first.","Five days later, his left shin was red and sore, his body was aching, and he had fever and chills. Doctors diagnosed him with a Shewanella algae infection, a bacterium that thrives in brackish water.","“Everyone worries about sharks in the water, and what got me was this tiny micro-organism,” Mr. Houlihan said.","Water-borne pathogens like S. algae appear to be turning up more often in the Northeast. Another serious infection, the flesh-eating bacterium Vibrio vulnificus, killed three people in the New York area this summer. The bacterium enters the body through scrapes or cuts; it can also be ingested by eating raw shellfish.","While it was once seen mostly around Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, V. vulnificus seems to be colonizing new waters. “It used to be highly unusual north of the Carolinas,” said Jim Oliver, a microbiologist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. “Now it’s fairly routine.”He is an author of a recent study that found that V. vulnificus wound infections increased eight-fold in the eastern United States between 1988 and 2018, from 10 to 80 infections per year. Cases were identified an average of 48 kilometers farther north each year, according to the study, which was published in the journal Scientific Reports.","By 2018, infections caused by various Vibrio species (there are at least a dozen) were reported regularly as far north as Philadelphia. There were more than 1,100 Vibrio wound infections between 1988 and 2018, and 159 deaths. The infections have become a “microbial barometer of climate change,” according to the paper.","Earlier this month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged medical providers to consider V. vulnificus to be a possible culprit if they see a wound infection in someone who has been in coastal waters, and to initiate aggressive antibiotic treatment immediately. The infection can kill in as little as a day.","“Many bacteria, including Vibrio, are more abundant in warm waters, and we know that water temperatures are increasing, and we had record-breaking heat waves this summer,” said Joan Brunkard, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C.","A recent study that tracked Vibrio and Shewanella infections between 2010 and 2018 in Denmark found that most cases occurred in years when seawater temperatures were high.","These infections are rarely acquired domestically in northern European countries because coastal seawater is mostly too cold to support high bacterial levels. But the warming of low-salinity coastal waters in the Baltic Sea has fueled growth of the bacteria, increasing the risk of human infections, the authors said.","The number of infections was higher during warmer summers, compared with colder summers, the researchers found. Vibrio and Shewanella infections increased during every summer in the study period, the paper reported. The summers of 2014 and 2018, which saw very high sea surface temperatures, coincided with a higher number of infections.","The study found that older people, men and boys were at greater risk — the boys probably because they were more likely to have gotten scratches or wounds while engaging in activities such as fishing or rowing, and the bacteria need only a small entry point to get into the body.","Ear infections, many caused by S. algae, were more common than wound infections, according to the Danish study, which was published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. But V. vulnificus more often led to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that results when the body’s defenses injure its own tissues and organs. (Limb amputations are sometimes necessary.)The problem is not just that waterborne pathogens may be heading to new waters. The populations in the United States and Europe are also aging. Older people, the immunocompromised, people with diabetes and those with liver disease are particularly vulnerable.","For them, “it’s not a good idea to go wading in brackish waters in really warm times,” Dr. Brunkard said.","People who are older or who have chronic conditions should avoid swimming at any time if they have even a small open cut or opening in the skin, the C.D.C. says. Even a small puncture point, like a recent piercing or tattoo, can open the door to a pathogen.","Mr. Houlihan believes his cracked toenail was all Shewanella needed. Since his leg became infected, he has been hospitalized three times, for a total of 26 days.","During the first hospitalization he developed a high fever and sepsis. Although the fever dropped and Mr. Houlihan was sent home, his pain was intense, and he was back in the hospital on two more occasions.","Large blisters developed on his lower leg, and he had to undergo surgery to remove the damaged tissue, leaving an indented crater that wrapped around his lower shin.","Now there is an open wound on his leg. The bandages must be changed daily, and though he is able to walk, it is with some difficulty. The treatment is not yet over: He is scheduled for more surgery and a skin graft later this month, and will then start a regimen of physical therapy."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/health/beaches-bacteria-vibrio-shewanella.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/20/multimedia/20bacteria-fjpz/20bacteria-fjpz-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 14:00:09+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:08.640159+00');

Eder and Allie Pitchon', 'health', '["A visiting researcher at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center was startled when he read the warning from the Food and Drug Administration about a product that had been used in spine surgeries at the esteemed Manhattan hospital.","The fluid, derived from umbilical cord blood, was not approved for such procedures, the agency cautioned, and its Idaho manufacturer had been cited for possible contamination problems and inadequate screening of donors, making the product potentially unsafe.","Yet before that advisory, about 40 patients at the hospital had received treatment with the fluid under the direction of Dr. Roger Härtl, a senior surgeon and professor at Weill Cornell, who is also a physician for the New York Giants. The surgeries were documented in a draft study that Dr. Härtl and others, including the visiting researcher, had intended to publish, tracking the fluid’s effectiveness in fusing delicate bones.","After seeing the F.D.A. announcement, the researcher, Dr. Pravesh Gadjradj, approached Dr. Härtl and told him the fluid “is not yet proven to be safe,” according to a complaint filed with the hospital that was reviewed by The New York Times. The fluid fell under a booming area of treatment known as regenerative medicine, which is aimed at replacing or restoring damaged cells through gene and stem cell therapies.","In the complaint, Dr. Gadjradj said Dr. Härtl requested that he “delete” the research file on the project and “never bring up the topic again.” The researcher said he was concerned that Dr. Härtl had not gone on to inform the patients, according to the complaint, and instead “covered it up.”The conversation cited in the complaint was in the spring of last year, Dr. Gadjradj said in an interview. In January, after months of worrying about the patients — and believing that they still had not been notified — Dr. Gadjradj lodged the complaint against his boss.","Still, he said, nothing came of sounding the alarm about his patient concerns. “Maybe all of these patients don’t have any adverse effects, but maybe they do,” he said. “We don’t know. That’s a terrible thing.” Because of privacy protections, Dr. Gadjradj said, he would not disclose the names of the patients or contact them himself.","F.D.A. warning letters do not require that patients be notified about a product’s potential problems, posing an ethical dilemma for clinicians, according to medical ethics experts.","Even in the absence of a formal requirement, they said, there is often a moral obligation to inform patients, especially regarding new or untested treatments, but other considerations can get in the way.","“The safer thing, the more ethical thing, would be to tell everybody and give them whatever information you’ve got about what’s known about the risks,” said Hank Greely, a law professor at Stanford and director of its Center for Law and the Biosciences. But, he said, doctors and hospitals “are going to be reluctant to do that because they don’t want to look bad, don’t want to attract lawsuits and don’t want to make patients unhappy with them.”Dozens of other medical centers, including prestigious institutions like Duke University Health System and the George Washington University Hospital, also listed the fluid, known as BioBurst, on their hospital pricing records, according to data collected by the company Visible Charges. Umbilical cord blood products have been approved by the F.D.A. to treat disorders that affect blood production.","A spokeswoman for NewYork-Presbyterian would not comment on Dr. Gadjradj’s complaint. She said that the hospital had stopped using BioBurst before the F.D.A. issued its warning in February 2022, but she would not say whether patients had been told about receiving the fluid or, later, about its potential problems.","Dr. Härtl, who is the founder and director of the Weill Cornell Medicine Center for Comprehensive Spine Care, declined to be interviewed when reached by telephone. He later said in emails that he had used the fluid between 2019 and 2021 “as a bone grafting alternative” in minimally invasive spine surgeries. He did not directly address questions about what patients knew, but wrote that he “did not receive any patient complaints or see any unexpected adverse events, such as infections or revision surgeries, directly associated with the use of BioBurst Fluid.”“My goal has always been to reduce the pain and suffering of patients by advancing the effectiveness of spine surgery” he said.","In the emails, Dr. Härtl also disputed “any implication that we used or studied” BioBurst in an “inappropriate manner,” and said that “all relevant data” remained on file and “any suggestion otherwise is not true.” A draft of the unpublished study, reviewed by The Times, said it had been approved by Weill Cornell’s institutional review board and had been “granted a waiver of consent.”The manufacturer, Burst Biologics, a small biotechnology company, had shipped the fluid to hospitals and clinics across the country, saying it could potentially stimulate bone regeneration. The draft study said the use of the product “showed promising results” when compared with existing literature on the subject.","The fluid belongs to a growing area of medicine that has drawn stepped-up attention from regulators. There are about 3,000 active investigational drug applications for cell and gene therapies, according to the F.D.A. Patients have clamored for the therapies to treat Parkinson’s disease, autism, arthritis, back pain and other conditions, but approval has been limited to certain cancers, disorders and immune conditions and includes fewer than three dozen products.","In 2021, as Dr. Härtl and the research team were compiling their findings, F.D.A. investigators visited Burst’s laboratory in an office park near the Boise airport. An inspection found numerous problems, including significant breaches in sterile manufacturing and monitoring processes, as well as a failure to adequately screen donors for the Zika virus and other communicable pathogens, according to an inspection report.","The agency also said that BioBurst Fluid and a similar product, BioBurst Rejuv, did not have proper approval.","The F.D.A. ratcheted up scrutiny of the company and in February 2022 publicly posted the warning letter. The next month, Burst recalled vials of the two products, and its founder declared bankruptcy by year’s end; the company’s equipment was soon sold at auction. While recalls of the most seriously defective medical products can include a process for notifying patients, Burst’s did not rise to that level.","The founder, Christopher Jones, did not respond to requests for comment, but in correspondence with the F.D.A., which The Times obtained through a public records request, he defended his products as safe and accused the agency of being overzealous in its enforcement. “My business has been warned by F.D.A. of alleged safety concerns with its products related to a regulatory scheme that does not apply to my business,” he wrote.","The F.D.A. would not comment on the company or the use of the fluid at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. But Carly Pflaum, an agency spokeswoman, said in a written statement that as regenerative medicine companies make “unsubstantiated claims about the potential benefits” of unproven therapies, doctors and patients “may use these unapproved products with a false sense of security about their safety and efficacy” and are likely to underreport “adverse events.”Five years ago, patients became seriously ill in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas with infections after receiving injections in their knees, shoulders or spines that contained stem cells from umbilical cord blood not associated with Burst. The F.D.A. responded by pledging more inspections of the industry and warned about companies making unfounded claims.","Interviews as well as a review of government and corporate records by The Times found that Burst expanded its national footprint even as its own employees raised concerns to management and regulators as far back as 2017 about product safety, lab conditions and the skirting of regulatory requirements.","During that time, regulators did not take substantial action while the company was cultivating ties with doctors across the country, inviting some to visit Boise and meeting with others at medical conferences.","Among the doctors who learned about BioBurst Fluid at a medical conference: Dr. Härtl, according to a spokeswoman for Weill Cornell Medicine, the hospital''s academic partner.","In March, when Dr. Gadjradj called NewYork-Presbyterian’s compliance office to check on his complaint, he was told that the hospital had created a committee and restructured how it screened the purchase of biologics — a class of drugs made from living organisms that included BioBurst.","Although it was unclear from the call when and why the committee was created, the compliance official told Dr. Gadjradj: “BioBurst Fluid didn’t get vetted in the same manner” as other products purchased after the committee was created, according to a recording of the conversation shared with The Times.","After spending time in the U.S. Marine Corps, Mr. Jones, the Burst founder, became an entrepreneur and marketer. In 2010, he set up shop in Boise distributing medical implants used in spinal and orthopedic surgeries.","Within a few years, Mr. Jones had focused on the “cutting edge of biologics,” serving “hospitals and surgeons” and selling products under the name Burst Biologics, according to the company’s website. The company said it was committed to patient safety, employing Ph.D. scientists and medical directors to oversee the processing of products.","But in interviews with The Times, 11 former employees detailed serious problems that included subpar laboratory practices, a lack of training, inadequate safety protocols and a retaliatory work environment.","Several said they also had concerns about the regulatory status of two of the company’s main products, BioBurst Fluid and BioBurst Rejuv, both derived from umbilical cord blood and used in operating rooms and medical clinics.","The company had insisted that because the fluids required only minimal processing, they belonged to a product class that was not subject to heavy regulatory oversight or licensing requirements.","But in 2017, as regenerative medicine was gaining popularity, the F.D.A. alerted companies to new guidelines and clarified the approval and licensing process, which would require more rigorous testing for efficacy and safety.","To give the companies a chance to gain their footing, the agency limited enforcement to significant safety threats. But the F.D.A. spokeswoman, Ms. Pflaum, said in the statement to The Times that the largely hands-off approach “did not excuse the violations of manufacturers or health care providers offering unapproved regenerative medicine products that have the potential to put patients at significant risk.”At least seven former Burst employees — including a research director, Trillitye Paullin, and two lab technicians, Dylan Walker and Brecken Robb — said they suspected that the fluids fell under the more stringent F.D.A. standards. And multiple times, some of them said, they told their managers that the company should acknowledge that fact and apply for a biologics license.","In an email reviewed by The Times, Dr. Walker alerted the F.D.A. in February 2018 about the employees’ regulatory concerns. Soon after, investigators visited the Boise lab, but they noted no significant problems, according to a review of F.D.A. documents.","That December, the company’s correspondence indicates, it received a letter from the F.D.A. saying that Burst appeared to be offering “stem cell” products to treat a variety of conditions. But it would be almost two and a half years before the agency took significant action against the company.","In his 2018 email, Dr. Walker also expressed “grave concerns” about screening protocols for the Zika virus, because the company’s main supplier was an umbilical cord bank in Puerto Rico, where Zika was prevalent.","Around the same time, Burst’s former head of research development, Dr. Paullin, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration about Zika exposure.","When she became pregnant, she said, she told top management that she would only handle material that had been deemed Zika-free. But after returning from a short leave for National Guard duty, Dr. Paullin said, she was informed by a co-worker that some placentas she had been handling had tested positive.","She quit her job within days and filed the OSHA complaint, one of three the agency said it received about Burst in 2017 and 2018. OSHA said it resolved the complaints without penalty, and told Dr. Paullin in a letter that the agency closed her case after determining that “the hazardous conditions no longer exist.” Her daughter was born healthy a few months later.","How an unapproved medical product with serious manufacturing concerns made its way into the inventory of a respected New York medical institution remains unanswered. Spokeswomen for both NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine would not explain how or when products are approved at the hospital, and would not comment on a recorded phone call between Dr. Gadjradj, the visiting researcher, and a compliance officer.","Hospitals tend to have a formal review process for products that will be used on patients. A committee often vets requests from doctors before the products are bought by the procurement department.","In interviews, doctors at several other hospitals said they also used Burst’s products and expressed surprise that the F.D.A. had issued a warning about them.","Dr. Faheem A. Sandhu, a spine surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, said that he learned about BioBurst Fluid through a company sales representative around 2017, and that he had been led to believe the product was F.D.A.-approved. “I was just another customer,” he said.","Dr. Sandhu said he had used the product on at least 50 patients, thought it worked well and hadn’t detected any problems. He recalled that for some patients, insurance covered Burst treatment, which typically cost thousands of dollars. But if he had been aware of the regulatory concerns, he said, he would not have used it and he does not believe it would have gotten through the hospital’s screening process. He said he would have notified patients had the F.D.A. or the company recommended doing so.","Dr. Gadjradj had experience with clinical research on spine surgery but knew nothing about Burst when he arrived in New York for his two years as a postdoctoral research fellow at Weill Cornell.","He said he got off to a good start working for Dr. Härtl, but their standoff over the Burst research soured their relationship.","Dr. Gadjradj said it was the hospital’s lack of transparency with patients that was most troubling to him.","“They can’t ring the bell if something goes wrong,” said Dr. Gadjradj, who completed his tenure with Dr. Härtl at the end of June and returned home to the Netherlands with plans to finish a residency in neurosurgery. “We don’t know because we just discharged them like nothing happened.”Apoorva Mandavilli contributed reporting, and Julie Tate contributed research."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/health/regenerative-medicine-risks-ethics.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/31/multimedia/00regenerative-04-vfqb/00regenerative-04-vfqb-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 09:00:30+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:09.263855+00');

“I kept getting pushback, like, ‘That’s not going to help you get to know anyone,’” she said.","Of particular concern was her answer to the prompt “name a random fact you love.” Instead of something flirty, Dr. Alexander, a clinical psychologist who was new to Hinge but experimenting at the onset of the pandemic, led with a fact that spoke to her as a scientist. “You can’t actually multitask,” she wrote. “Your brain has to switch back and forth.”When Oladipo Akinkunmi Fatade read that answer while browsing Hinge two months later, he resisted the urge to multitask and paid attention. “It gave me a window into her personality,” he said. For him, the fact’s randomness, combined with her lighthearted answers to other prompts, spelled jackpot. “She was gorgeous, and it seemed like she didn’t take herself too seriously. I was like, ‘That’s the girl for me.’”Dr. Alexander wasn’t sure, however, that he was the guy for her when they met for a first date on June 28, 2020, at Bryant Park in Manhattan.","Dr. Alexander, 35, practices psychology in the Mood Disorders Center at Manhattan’s Child Mind Institute. Mr. Fatade, also 35, writes creative copy for the concept and design studio team at Warner Bros. Discovery’s Max app. Both are first-generation Americans. Dr. Alexander’s family is Trinidadian; Mr. Fatade’s, Nigerian. But it was the potential for a social, not a cultural, mismatch that concerned Dr. Alexander when he came striding toward her in the park that summer.","“He seemed so cool and chill, like the popular guy in high school,” Dr. Alexander said. As such, he was not relatable. “I was definitely the academic girl with her head in the books.” Before they shared a picnic lunch he had planned, she had to rummage through her psychological toolbox to dispel a bout of paranoia.","Though he had shown up for the date, his dash to Panera Bread to pick up sandwiches just after introducing himself left her wondering if he would return. “I went through a lot of deductive reasoning,” she said, to convince herself that Mr. Fatade hadn’t made a spur-of-the-moment decision to ghost her. The picnic blanket he left with her became a temporary security blanket.","“It seemed nice, like something of quality,” she said. “I thought, he probably wouldn’t leave that behind.” But he wouldn’t have left her, either. Just seeing her in her first-date outfit — an oversize pinstripe shirt, biker shorts and chunky socks in white sneakers — he was already halfway in love, he said. “She seemed so casual and cool. I thought, this day is going to go well.”Binge more Vows columns here and read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here.","Mr. Fatade, a self-described extrovert whose nickname, Ladi, rhymes with his last name, was born in Manhattan but spent his childhood in his parents’ native Lagos with an older sister, Abisola Fatade. His parents, Isaac Akin Fatade and Aderonke Fatade, divorced in 2016; he has three younger half-siblings on his father’s side. As an adolescent, he went to a British boarding school in Togo, then returned to the United States to attend Emory University, where he graduated in 2009 with a bachelor’s degree in political science.","Three years later, he completed a copywriting program at Miami Ad School in Atlanta. The same year, he moved to Manhattan to live with Abisola, now an assistant counsel at the office at the New York State attorney general.","Dr. Alexander’s parents, Israel and Molly Alexander, emigrated from Trinidad and Tobago in the 1970s. They settled in Crown Heights, Brooklyn with her two older brothers, then moved to Queens Village. The family still live in her childhood home. “I love that house,” she said. “It’s been the pillar of my family.”Until she moved in with Mr. Fatade in 2022, she had never lived anywhere else, with the exception of a dorm room at Stony Brook University, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology in 2009. In 2020, she completed a doctoral degree in psychology at St. John’s University. She and Mr. Fatade live in Long Island City now; most Sundays, they visit her parents for a traditional Trinidadian dinner, often featuring the stews and curries she learned to make as a child.","Mr. Fatade’s prediction that their first date would go well was spot on. After their picnic lunch, they strolled around Manhattan for hours. Dr. Alexander felt herself falling for him and had to convince herself to pump the brakes. “I had it in the back of my mind that this was a first date, and I need to temper things,” she said.","Within weeks, though, all tempering bets were off. In late July, on another walk in Manhattan, they agreed to delete Hinge from their phones simultaneously. “There was no hesitation,” Dr. Alexander said. On the way to her train home, their phones each one app lighter, “we just looked at each other like, ‘Oh my God, we’re together,’” she said.","They have been ever since, at one point uncomfortably so. At the end of 2020, both contracted Covid on the plane ride home from a Christmas vacation to Panama with Mr. Fatade’s mother. While they quarantined together at Mr. Fatade’s Midtown apartment in January 2021, a beloved aunt of Dr. Alexander’s, Polly Chattun, died. “That was one of the more trying times in our dating phase,” Dr. Alexander said.","Though Mr. Fatade came through with the support that helped her grieve, her family felt her absence. “My dad really wanted to go to Ladi’s apartment and bring me home,” she said. “There was stress and worry at that time.”She felt additional tension until later that year, in December, when she passed a psychology licensing exam after months of studying. “It’s well known in the field of psychology what a stressor the exam can be,” she said. “Ladi saw the full range of my emotional wheelhouse, and he rode that wave with me.”By then, he was ready to ride whatever wave came next. “Kim makes me laugh so hard sometimes I roll on the ground,” he said. “And she wanted all the same things out of life I did. There were so many boxes that were checked with her.”When Dr. Alexander and Mr. Fatade moved to their apartment in Long Island City in April 2022, he already knew he wanted to propose.","“My parents are not fans of living together before marriage,” Dr. Alexander said.","Mr. Fatade helped reassure them that summer on a visit to Queens Village. While Dr. Alexander was in the front yard bathing Cosmo, the family dog, he asked for their blessing to marry her. “I knew her parents were apprehensive about us living together,” he said. Huddling with them to confide his level of commitment soothed them and delivered a sense of security.","Dr. Alexander still has trouble believing her parents were able to hide their excitement. “I honestly didn’t think they would be able to keep it from me,” she said. “We’re so close and enmeshed — I always know what they know.”On Sept. 2, 2022, after a visit to an art exhibition at the New York Public Library with Mr. Fatade’s sister, who had been recruited to snap pictures, he dropped to one knee in Bryant Park and presented Dr. Alexander with a diamond engagement ring. “I was overwhelmed by shock and surprise,” Dr. Alexander said. Her joyous “yes” was preceded by a more profane version of “Oh, wow.”“I had no tears, but I had curses,” she said. “I’m definitely not the classic bride.”Dr. Alexander and Mr. Fatade were married July 28 at Mr. Fatade’s family church in Manhattan, St. Bartholomew’s, where the Rev. Peter D. Thompson officiated a traditional Episcopalian wedding for 86 guests. For that occasion, Dr. Alexander was a classic American bride: In her white column wedding dress by the designer Sarah Seven, she walked down a narrow aisle clutching a bouquet of white flowers, escorted by her father. When they were pronounced married, “we lifted up each other’s hands like we had won something,” she said.","Two days later, with 160 guests in attendance, they had a traditional Nigerian wedding ceremony at the Foundry, an events space in Long Island City. The bride and groom and their families wore colorful Nigerian wedding clothes and headpieces sourced from Africa, some of it designed by Anu Oye in Brooklyn. Anita Clegg, an alaga, or wedding M.C., officiated a ceremony that, by the time it wrapped, had included hours of celebratory dancing with friends and extended family.","Monica Shah was Dr. Alexander’s maid of honor at both events. The love that hovered over the couple at each moved and enchanted her. “They’re two very committed people,” said Dr. Shah, also a psychologist. “At both ceremonies, you could feel how much they love each other.”When July 28, 2023Where St. Bartholomew’s Church, ManhattanTwo Looks “It’s hard to pick which I loved more,” Dr. Alexander said of her two wedding ceremonies. Her white gown and her blue and gold outfit for the Nigerian wedding had what she called different personalities. But at the Foundry, “our colors were stunning. And I still looked like me.”Global Roots Mr. Fatade’s parents have been moving between the United States and Nigeria for decades. His father, a venture capitalist, now splits his time between Atlanta and Nigeria. His mother moved to North Bergen, N.J., just before the couple met in 2020. Dr. Alexander’s parents are both retired and, in addition to hosting Sunday dinners, spend time at home with their two grandsons.","Custom Blend For both families, a church wedding was important. At the Episcopalian wedding, the couple wove Trinidadian flourishes into a reception at the church, including soca music. At the Nigerian ceremony, they served a Caribbean fusion menu featuring jerk Cornish hen and red snapper. “We wanted a nice blend of both cultures,” Dr. Alexander said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/style/kimberly-alexander-ladi-fatade-wedding.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/10/fashion/08VOWS-BRYANT-PARK/08VOWS-BRYANT-PARK-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-08 04:00:26+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:16.893509+00');

'By Chloe Anello', 'style', '["A few months before her wedding, Veronica Ume-Ezeoke was scrolling through Pinterest when she stumbled upon an elaborate tulle, ruffled robe from Voir Bride, a Ukrainian brand. Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke already had a delicate lace robe to wear while getting ready for her July 2022 wedding, but she sent it to her sister anyway.","“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, could you imagine?’” Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke, 31, said. “My sister, a very facetious lady, was like, ‘Hideous. Ugly. Totally not you.’ And I was a little offended.”Turns out, Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke’s sister could picture her wearing it and bought it for her as a surprise. Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke, a senior associate at a health care tech company, had three wedding ceremonies to celebrate her and her husband’s different cultures — Nigerian, Korean and American.","An ornate robe felt right for getting ready with her bridal party for the American wedding. “I wanted to have this one moment of collective feminine energy and to pop champagne and be sexy,” Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke said. She’s not alone in wanting to bask in the getting ready aspect of the day.","Getting ready photos have long been customary, but according to Chi-Chi Ari, a photographer in New York, a larger emphasis has been put on them recently. “When you see this big production of getting ready on social media, brides see that and feel like they have to incorporate that into their weddings,” Ms. Ari said.","And they’ve become significantly more stylized, too, said Minh Cao, a Philadelphia-based photographer. “More thought goes into how that part of the day should be captured,” Ms. Cao said. “I’ve definitely seen the getting ready portion of the day getting more complex.”When hunting for an outfit to get ready in for her June 2021 wedding, Danielle Tullo La Testa noticed that most brides wore white button-down shirts and simple pajamas, rather than “standout robes.”“You’re getting ready for your wedding more than you’re doing anything else on that day,” said Mrs. Tullo La Testa, the founder of DLT Creative, a social media agency. “So with that idea, I wanted something unique and special, the same way my wedding dress was.”She commissioned a custom open-back robe with feathers, lace and a train from Lé Lauriér, a bridal designer in Brooklyn. Mrs. Tullo La Testa is also the founder and chief executive of Partier, a custom merchandising brand often used for wedding events, and she’s recently noticed other brides leaning into similar attire for their own weddings. There are also more options available for brides who want more glamour. “I think I’ve seen them pop up everywhere,” Mrs. Tullo La Testa, 29, said of the fancy robes. “I’m seeing them pop up in a smaller way on Etsy now, too.”Alisha Walt, 31, a legal coordinator for Gibson, a guitar company, chose a custom robe from Lé Lauriér over pajamas for her wedding last October. She didn’t want it to be “an everyday kind of thing,” she said. The robe “really took it to the next level for me, and it truly made me feel like it was my wedding.”Lauren Holovka, the designer behind Lé Lauriér, started her brand in 2018 and released her first collection of couture bridal robes, The Dress Before The Dress, shortly after. Ms. Holovka, 29, has noticed a significant boom in business in the last few years with more and more brides searching for couture getting-ready outfits. “Photographers tell me all the time, ‘We literally had to put a time slot in just for your bridal robe,’” she said.","Ms. Holovka, who has a team of six to 10 people, estimates that she creates around 150 to 200 bespoke bridal robes each month during busy season for clients around the world, including celebrities like Heather Rae El Moussa from the reality TV show “Selling Sunset” on Netflix and Teresa Giudice of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” Custom robes, which typically take about four to six months to make, range from $2,550 to $5,800, while ready-to-wear robes cost less than $1,000 and are not as elaborate.","Ms. Holovka doesn’t expect brides to wear these robes while having their hair and makeup done and recommends a separate robe for that. “For hair and makeup, I very much wanted to be in my element,” said Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke, who wore a white button-up shirt while getting her hair and makeup done. “And then I stepped into that bridal robe to change the mood and signal, ‘OK, it’s time to party now.’”While some robes can be just as luxurious as some wedding gowns, robes offer a bit is more versatility and can easily be worn again in the future, making it a worthwhile investment. Mrs. Tullo La Testa calls hers a “modern heirloom” and hopes to pass it down to her newborn daughter, Juliette, when she’s of age.","While Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke has offered her robe to friends who are planning weddings, so they have their “something borrowed,” she also envisions giving it to a daughter or niece in the future. Many brides re-wear their robes for maternity shoots as well, Ms. Holovka said, and some even return to the designer to repurpose them as Christening gowns for babies.","“I wouldn’t even care if I never wore it again,” said Mrs. Walt, who did end up wearing it on her honeymoon in Italy. “It was so special for the day. It was one of the best things that I’ve done.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/style/luxury-bridal-robes.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/fashion/16GET-READY-WED/16GET-READY-WED-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-14 04:00:21+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:17.56385+00');

its broadcast, Robin Rene Roberts and Amber Laign sat in the corner table of a restaurant a couple hundred feet away from the studio.","They were giddy because their wedding day was two weeks away, and they were excited to share their love story.","“I could not have imagined as a young girl growing up in Mississippi that I’d be sitting here with you in New York City, with my fiancée who is a woman, and freely, openly and passionately talking about it,” said Ms. Roberts, a host of “G.M.A.”“For it to be received as is,” she said, “is a gift.”Ms. Roberts wasn’t always so open about her relationship, having come out in a Facebook post in 2013, eight years after the couple started dating. And Ms. Laign wasn’t always comfortable stepping into the public eye. But now, the couple are embracing the spotlight. On Friday, Sept. 8, they married in their home in Farmington, Conn., and they sat down with The New York Times for an exclusive interview about their journey together.","They first met in 2005 because their mutual friends — Bert Schwartz and Alex Schlempp — set the two up on a blind date. But they had canceled on each other a few times.","“Bert had set me up before,” Ms. Roberts, 62, said. “And let’s just say it didn’t go so well, so his track record with me wasn’t the best.”Ms. Laign, 49, on the other hand, “just wasn’t in the mood.” So when she saw that Ms. Roberts did not go on air on the morning of July 26, 2005, she was relieved. She assumed that meant that Ms. Roberts was sick and would have to cancel their first date once again.","What had really happened was that Ms. Roberts had flown back to New York the night before, after covering the Tour de France with Lance Armstrong, and was exhausted. Technically, she wasn’t sick.","Before Ms. Roberts could cancel again, their friends nudged the two to go on the date. They knew the two women were just avoiding each other, and they had had enough.","“These were two friends who really knew us,” Ms. Roberts said, “and they were much more into us getting together than we were. I can’t wait to see them at the wedding.”That night, they finally met for drinks at the Library Bar at the Hudson Hotel in Midtown Manhattan — Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Schlempp included. Ms. Roberts had such a good time that she invited the group out to dinner. Although Mr. Schlempp couldn’t stay, and Ms. Laign had just met the other two in the group, she agreed to dinner anyway — “totally, completely stepping outside my comfort zone,” she said. “I’m a very shy person.” (They joked that she probably stayed for dinner because she was hungry. “I do have a great appetite,” Ms. Laign said.)Ms. Roberts is known for her compassion and warmth during television interviews. It’s the reason the two were drawn to each other after they first met. “She was just kind and warmhearted,” Ms. Roberts said of Ms. Laign.","That Saturday, Ms. Roberts would be traveling to Tahiti with friends. She wanted to see Ms. Laign before she left for vacation. She felt that calling her the next day was too soon, so she waited until Thursday to make plans for Friday.","“I let it go to voice mail,” Ms. Laign said. “I was so nervous, you know when you get that call and you see it and your heart starts racing?” She collected herself, and then called Ms. Roberts back. They went to the Eatery in Hell’s Kitchen for their second date.","The conversation was fluid, and when Ms. Laign told her friends how easy it was to talk with Ms. Roberts, they told her, “Well, that’s what she does for a living.”“And I was hurt,” Ms. Roberts said. “I wasn’t interviewing you for dinner!” But ultimately, Ms. Roberts’s questions allowed the two to learn a lot about each other, like their shared love for disco. “See, I learned something by asking my questions,” Ms. Roberts said with a laugh.","After Ms. Roberts returned from Tahiti, they went on several dates, but still hadn’t shared a kiss. About a month after their first date, in the elevator of Ms. Roberts’s apartment, she turned to Ms. Laign and said, “You know I like you, right?” (To which Ms. Laign responded with a soft “yes.”)“I felt like I was in high school,” Ms. Roberts said. “I’m like, ‘Man, you’re making me work!’”On Ms. Laign’s side, she said that she did not want to make a misstep, so she avoided flirting.","“I’m a really terrible flirter,” Ms. Laign said. “Still to this day,” Ms. Roberts added. (Asked if she herself is a flirt, Ms. Roberts said, “Oh, I’m good.”)A few weeks later, they finally shared their first kiss in Ms. Roberts’s apartment after some tequila on her balcony.","The couple had fun bonding over their differences. For instance, Ms. Laign said she didn’t know the first thing about sports. Ms. Roberts, who was an athlete in school and a longtime sportscaster, was accustomed to being around people who were passionate about them.","“It was refreshing,” said Ms. Roberts, who gave Ms. Laign quick rundowns on different sports’ rules. “I didn’t know who she was,” Ms. Laign added. She used to watch NBC’s “Today” show, not “G.M.A,\" so she wasn’t familiar with Ms. Roberts, who had made the move earlier in 2005 from a host on ESPN to an anchor of “G.M.A.” with Diane Sawyer and Charlie Gibson.","Asked if she likes sports now, Ms. Laign said, “I can hang.” Now, they go to matches at the U.S. Open and watch the Liberty basketball team at the Barclays Center.","Binge more Vows columns here and read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here.","From early on in their relationship, Ms. Laign has been a strong support system for Ms. Roberts through immense personal loss. This started in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, in August 2005. Much of Ms. Roberts’s hometown, Pass Christian, Miss., had been badly struck by the hurricane.","“I feel like I’m a natural caregiver,” said Ms. Laign, who grew up in Clayton, Calif. So when Ms. Roberts was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007, Ms. Laign stepped into the caretaker role without hesitation. And then again in 2012, when Ms. Roberts was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome, which required her to spend nearly six months off the air at “G.M.A.”“I was like, ‘Of course I’m going to be by your side.’ I would never, ever leave her,” Ms. Laign said.","So when Ms. Laign was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021, Ms. Roberts was able to return the caregiving.","“She taught me how,” Ms. Roberts said.","Ms. Roberts graduated from Southeastern Louisiana University with a bachelor’s degree in communication. Ms. Laign received an associate of occupational studies degree from Swedish Institute, College of Health Sciences. She is a founder of Plant Juice Oils, a women’s wellness store.","Although they first talked about marriage in 2014, on their way home from a trip to Hawaii, they seriously started considering it during the Covid-19 pandemic.","“It was just kind of one of those things that we talked about off and on over the years,” Ms. Roberts said. A lot of times, they would think, “We don’t need a piece of paper, we know our love is real,” Ms. Roberts said, facetiously mimicking themselves in a nasally, high pitched voice.","But during the pandemic, they lived together in their home in Farmington, Conn., from March to September 2020. Ms. Roberts was appearing on “G.M.A.” from the basement. They spent more time together in that time frame than they had in their entire relationship. They had tried living together early on in their relationship, but it was disrupting Ms. Roberts’s rigid morning routine, which involves waking up at 3:45 a.m. To this day, they’re still apart three nights a week — they each have an apartment on the Upper West Side, about 10 minutes apart.","Spending every day together during the pandemic was “awesome,” they said at the same time.","“When I had to go back in September and Amber stayed at home in Connecticut, it was hard,” Ms. Roberts said of 2020. That’s when they decided to commemorate their love with marriage.","They proposed to each other in December 2022 while they were sitting side by side in a booth at El Coyote in New Milford, Conn., one of their favorite restaurants. Ms. Roberts spontaneously stuck a “ring” — a piece of calamari — on Ms. Laign’s finger. And then Ms. Laign did the same in return.","They never even thought to get actual engagement rings afterward.","The couple married Sept. 8 in the backyard of their Connecticut home in front of 31 guests. Ms. Roberts’s childhood pastor, the Rev. Robert Jemerson, officiated.","Caroline Campbell, a violinist, played “Stand by Me,” Ms. Laign’s favorite song, for the couple’s entrance. In honor of Ms. Roberts’s mother Lucimarian Tolliver, who died in 2012, her father Col. Lawrence Roberts, who died in 2004, and Ms. Laign’s father Paul Laign, who died in 2020, the violinist performed a medley of their favorite songs: the gospel hymn “Blessed Assurance,” “What a Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong and “Chiquitita” by Abba.","Afterward, they partied with 250 guests at Farmington Gardens. The musical theme was disco, soul and R&B. Ms. Roberts posted a video on Instagram of her nephew, Jeremiah Craft, in a dance battle with fellow “G.M.A.” anchor Whit Johnson. The guest list included Billie Jean King, Spike Lee and George Stephanopoulos. Sam Champion, a former “G.M.A.” weather anchor, was the M.C. throughout the evening.","The brides wore custom Badgley Mischka gowns, and changed into white pantsuits during the reception. They hadn’t seen each other in their dresses until they walked down the aisle.","They had both planned surprises for each other. Ms. Roberts performed a special dance for Ms. Laign, which turned into a flash mob consisting of a dozen people. And in reference to their first date, when Ms. Roberts had asked Ms. Laign if she wanted to stay after drinks and have dinner, Ms. Laign got a phrase sewn into her gown: “Yes to dinner, always.”When Sept. 8, 2023Where Farmington, Conn.","Backyard Ceremony The couple married in front of a bench to commemorate Ms. Roberts’s mother. Her mother had read devotionals to the couple there. The bench, which is engraved with her mother’s name, was decorated with flowers. The yard was also adorned with moss as a nod to Ms. Roberts’s roots in Mississippi.","Bouquet Toss The couple threw their bouquets at the same time, inviting all single people onto the dance floor to catch them, rather than just single women. Ms. Roberts’s bouquet included a locket with a picture of her father on one side and her mother on the other. Before the toss, she remembered to remove the locket.","Love Wins At the reception, drinks were decorated with custom, edible sugar disks that read, “Love wins.” “The fact that people are so happy for us is a gift,” Ms. Roberts said. “And it’s not just a gift for us. It’s a gift for those who are in areas of this country who may have a parent or grandparent who doesn’t quite see it like this, but they see us, and they see that we just love each other. We’re very boring, but we just love each other.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/style/robin-roberts-amber-laign-wedding.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/17/fashion/11VOWS-ROBIN-ROBERTS/11VOWS-ROBIN-ROBERTS-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-11 21:21:38+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:19.414708+00');

'By Anna Kodé', 'style', '["One evening after a long day at work, Diksha Manocha was idly scrolling Instagram when she stumbled across something peculiar: an account for Join My Wedding, an online service that allows tourists to purchase tickets to weddings in India.","Ms. Manocha, 26, was in the thick of preparing for her own destination wedding — a three-day affair that would take place in the scenic city of Jaipur, “famous for its heritage, its beauty, its greenery and everything that can showcase a proper big, fat Indian wedding,” said Ms. Manocha, who lives in Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore.","She had always been one to try new things. So, after researching and confirming that the site was “legit,” Ms. Manocha registered her wedding, opening it to strangers from other countries to attend. A tourist from Brazil and her friend purchased tickets, and Ms. Manocha tasked her brothers with educating them on traditions, what to wear and where to go.","Looking back on the July wedding now, it was a risk worth taking, she said. Seeing strangers embrace her culture with such enthusiasm is an experience she will remember forever, said Ms. Manocha, a manager at a finance firm. “When I met them, they were full of joy and happiness,” she said. “They were interested to know everything.”Bollywood films have frequently depicted grand Indian weddings filled with dance sequences — take, for example, “Jodhaa Akbar” (a three-and-a-half-hour long feature centered around a royal marriage) and “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham…” (or nearly any movie starring Shah Rukh Khan, for that matter). The romantic drama series “Made in Heaven” on Amazon Prime follows a wedding planning company in Delhi, and there’s even a plotline involving one character profiting from inviting foreign tourists to the weddings in the newly released second season.","American media has also grasped onto Indian weddings to pulp for colorful scenes, like in the 2008 classic romantic comedy “27 Dresses,” in which Katherine Heigl changes into a sari in a cab, while rushing to a Hindu-Jewish wedding. More recently, Netflix’s “Murder Mystery 2” featured Adam Sandler in a cream-colored sherwani and Jennifer Aniston in a lehenga. Offscreen, Nick and Priyanka Chopra Jonas’s 2018 wedding at Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, publicized via Instagram posts and magazine spreads, led to countless jaw-drops (some coverage stirred controversy, too).","Join My Wedding, promoted by the founder, Orsi Parkanyi, as the “the Airbnb of weddings,” is capitalizing on the public interest in lavish Indian weddings by allowing tourists to purchase tickets to one of the most publicized, celebrated — and sacred — aspects of Indian culture.","And while the site’s offer can lead to feel-good moments of cultural exchange, like in the case of Ms. Manocha, some argue that it can also result in a flattening of the Indian wedding experience.","“The fetishization of Indian weddings and wedding tourism is a two-way street: the ‘seller’ gets money (and social status), and the buyer gets the product, namely, the experience of an Indian wedding without investing years of emotions in a friendship,” Parul Bhandari, a sociologist at the University of Cambridge and the author of “Matchmaking in Middle Class India,” wrote in an email.","Dr. Bhandari added that wedding tourism is part of the larger trend of selling experiences, comparing it to travelers attending tea ceremonies when visiting Japan.","Join My Wedding customers can choose to attend just one day of wedding events for $150 or two or more days for $250 (Indian weddings typically have multiple ceremonies that take place over three days, though some go longer). The majority of the fee, which Join My Wedding also calls a “contribution,” is kept by the couple, and the site takes a commission, the founder said.","Ms. Parkanyi, a Hungarian-Australian entrepreneur based in Lier, Norway, founded Join My Wedding in 2016. She had never been to an Indian wedding before creating the business, but “Indian weddings are world famous,” she said, pointing to Bollywood as what drew her attention to them. “It’s like a music festival,” she said.","Last month, the site had over 1,200 weddings registered that a traveler could choose from, and over 400 bookings have been made through it in total, according to Ms. Parkanyi. The business currently focuses on access to weddings in India, but Ms. Parkanyi, 40, said she hopes to expand to other countries.","“Every cultural element is right there at a wedding,” she said. “If I had just one day in any country in the world, I would want to just go to a wedding.”To become hosts, a couple must complete a questionnaire and nominate a “ceremony guide,” Ms. Parkanyi said. The ceremony guide, usually a close friend or family member of the bride and groom, is responsible for explaining the various ceremonies and festivities to the tourists, as well as answering any questions on what to wear and where to stay.","On the website, tourists can scan the various listings, which have images of the couple along with brief descriptions of their love story. “Join us for a grand affair filled with love, culture and warmth as we embark on a journey together with our beloved families,” one description reads. Another couple wrote that they “were classmates from kindergarten till high school. We fell for each other and decided to get married.” A few even include professionally filmed videos, that almost seem like promos for the couple.","In interviews, several host couples said inviting paying strangers was not a financial decision — especially considering the almost negligible amount made in relation to the total cost of a large Indian wedding — but more about sharing their culture or adding a distinctive component to their wedding.","Gaurav Passy and Pooja Tandon, who are both 33 and live in Delhi, got married in 2019 and ultimately decided to allow a couple from Mexico to join their wedding. Ms. Tandon, who took some convincing, is happy they did.","At one point, the guests told Ms. Tandon, a manager at an engineering firm, about how they noticed similarities between the ceremonies they performed at home with some of the Indian rituals they witnessed. “We call ourselves so culturally different, but that’s not the case,” Ms. Tandon said. “It was so heartwarming.”“It was a cultural collab,” Mr. Passey, a sales manager, said, adding that the wedding had over 400 guests, so it wasn’t too much trouble to add a few more. (Join My Wedding tries to cap tourists at half a dozen per wedding.) The couple donated the proceeds from their ticket sales to Covid health care response.","Around 250 people attended Yamini and Aditya Sharma’s opulent wedding in January, which took place at a venue in Jaipur called R Chandra’s Palace. The entire wedding cost about 30 million rupees, said Mr. Sharma, 27, who runs a construction equipment business, which is roughly equivalent to $360,000, so the comparatively meager profit from the ticket sales “doesn’t do anything for me,” he said.","Mr. Sharma had heard about Join My Wedding through a relative, and said he participated because he thought it would be “unique” to have a foreigner at his wedding. He said he also wanted to show off his pride in being Indian. “We always appreciate tourists in our country. So to provide them with the great ambience and experience of an Indian wedding, I thought that I should sign up.”For some Indian couples, Dr. Bhandari, the sociologist at the University of Cambridge, said, part of the appeal of having a foreign attendee at one’s wedding also has to do with the element of elevated status that it might portray to onlookers. “A non-Indian, particularly white person, attending one’s wedding is seen as a status symbol,” she added. “It communicates that the couple or their family have social networks beyond their country and by that token, demonstrates a sort of cosmopolitanism and ‘success.’”Emily Lord, 47, who lives in Sioux Falls, S.D., and works in programming for the Department of Veterans Affairs, attended Mr. Sharma’s wedding earlier this year. She already had a trip to India planned when she learned about Join My Wedding from a friend, so she decided to add it to her itinerary. “I just felt like a princess. I stayed in this room that was absolutely gorgeous,” Ms. Lord said. “And then I got to wear all these beautiful clothes.” When asked if she was concerned about appropriating another culture, Ms. Lord said she was more worried about being a minority in a new country. “I’m never the only white person in a room,” Ms. Lord said. “That’s only happened to me maybe twice in my entire life.”When it came to food, there were moments where other guests “would laugh at me and be like, ‘No, you can’t dip that in there.’ And I’m like, ‘It tastes good, try it,’” Ms. Lord said. “It felt like if someone came here and put ketchup and applesauce on their hot dog.”Another traveler, Sarah McDonald, a 30-year-old ​​geologist in Halifax, Nova Scotia, decided to buy a ticket for a wedding during her 2019 backpacking trip in India with a friend. Ms. McDonald recalled getting “called out” for not wearing a sari at one ceremony that they were told to do so for. “We were backpacking, so there was sort of no way that we were going to be able to get these tailored, beautiful gowns for the wedding,” she said. “We tried to buy saris, but when we were in our rooms trying to put them on, we couldn’t make it work. It’s a bit complicated. So we wore flowy skirts and pants that had some decorative, Indian-style embellishments.”Ms. McDonald said she didn’t feel any concern about coming into a traditional, sacred event as an outsider. “There were a lot of eyes on us, because we definitely stood out,” she said. “But I didn’t really feel anxious about breaking any customs or disrespecting any religious rituals.”In interviews, some travelers referred to traditional clothing as “costumes” and religious ceremonies as “Bollywood performances.” While the general absence of cultural sensitivity often occurs out of ignorance, Dr. Bhandari said that “race and ethnic identities can lend a sense of superiority and confidence to ‘experience’ someone else’s celebration.”Rochona Majumdar, a professor of South Asian studies at the University of Chicago, added that cultural experiences are often packaged to be consumed quickly. “There’s a certain entitlement here,” she said.","But another issue that arises, Dr. Majumdar said, is a “flattening out of Indian culture.” She added, “it’s a very big country, and weddings aren’t held in the same way everywhere.” She added, “For example, where I’m from in Bengal, people typically don’t dance in their weddings, and yet now you have a standard model of what an Indian wedding is, and it looks very much like watching Bollywood.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/style/indian-wedding-tickets-tourists.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/18/multimedia/TICKETED-INDIAN-WEDDINGS-02-lzfg/TICKETED-INDIAN-WEDDINGS-02-lzfg-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-21 09:00:17.241+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:19.943791+00');

So this week, after I watched a video or two about the fires sweeping through Maui, my For You Page was nearly all content from creators in Hawaii.","One central topic kept coming up: Should tourists stay away from the island of Maui after last week’s deadly fires? Was it OK to travel to places on Maui that were not hit directly? What about the whole archipelago of Hawaii? Would traveling put added strain on limited resources during the crisis?Kate Ducheneau, a TikTok creator from Lahaina whose family evacuated during the fires, told me it had been hard seeing tourists around the area. Her house is still standing, she said, but it suffered extensive damage.","The day after the fire, she went to Target to buy clothing for her family. “I was in line, just trying to get a Starbucks coffee,” she said, when she spotted a couple who appeared to be tourists. “They were wearing puka shell necklaces. They had their key to their rental car. They were joking about how they’re going to load up all their supplies and ‘go have a staycation.’” She burst into tears in line, she said.","On TikTok, where she’s gained thousands of followers after she started posting about the fire, she urged would-be visitors to go elsewhere.","“Do not come to Maui,” she said in a video that has been viewed more than two million times since it was posted on Sunday. “Cancel your trip. Now.”She told me she wanted to be very clear she’s not anti-tourist, but rather she hoped that tourists would respect that Lahaina needs time to heal and rebuild before they come visit.","“People are preying on trauma,” Kailee Soong, a spiritual mentor who lives on Maui in Waikapu, wrote on TikTok, where she has over 100,000 followers. Tourists, she added, “are in the way right now as people mourn the loss of their loved ones, of the places that burned down, of the history that was completely erased.”“The grief is overwhelming — and then for the tourists to just be snorkeling in the same waters that our people are in, it’s not right,” Soong told me in an interview.","My colleague Christine Chung and I wrote a longer piece this week for the Travel desk. A lot of conflicting messages are swirling around. The right thing to do depends on whom you ask. “No matter what, the rest of Maui has to keep going on,” Daniel Kalahiki, who operates a food truck in Wailuku on Maui, east of Lahaina, told Christine. “The island has already been shot in the chest. Are you going to stab us in the heart also?”One of the things TikTok does well is allow regular people living through major events to become newscasters. During Hurricane Ian in Florida last year, I talked to a number of people who livestreamed the storm for audiences of thousands online.","This is important as TikTok increasingly becomes the preferred search engine of younger generations. Clearly, you can’t believe everything you see online. But if I’m a potential tourist considering a trip to Maui right now, the people I really want to be hearing from are the regular folks whose lives would be affected by my trip. And those people are on TikTok.","Here’s what else is happening online this week.","Werner Herzog is narrating a book of A.I. poetry.","They’re reviewing movies on TikTok. Just don’t call them critics.","Britney Spears is getting back in the saddle.","Social media is buzzing about a fake movie. Again.","Party City has joined the big skeleton wars.","A note for chiropractors.","Somewhere in the first two sentences of many stories about TikTok — including this newsletter! — there’s a mention of the app’s potent algorithm.","That’s why it’s going to be really interesting when TikTok users in the European Union gain the ability to shut that algorithm off. That’s a result of the E.U.’s Digital Services Act, which requires social media companies to let users turn off recommendation algorithms.","There are many reasons to be concerned about the effects of TikTok’s algorithm. That said, a big part of TikTok’s draw is that it is extremely good at showing you exactly what you want to see. If you’re a Swiftie, it will serve you an unending feed of Swiftie videos. If you’re flirty and into pottery, you’ll get ceramicist thirst traps.","Many of us say we want the social media giants to have less visibility into our lives and desires. We’re also hooked on videos that reflect those desires right back at us. Without the algorithm, users will see an undifferentiated feed, amalgamated from the interests of other TikTok users.","I’m certain some people will try opting out; I’m less sure that they’ll like what they see. —Callie Holtermann"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/style/hawaii-tok-wants-tourists-to-stay-home.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/15/multimedia/HAWAII-TOK-02-ghlb/HAWAII-TOK-02-ghlb-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-08-18 17:22:08+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:20.214484+00');

Oh, and dating apps are for networking, The Wall Street Journal says.","If you can’t tell, social networks are having a bit of an identity crisis.","Facebook, once the center of the platform universe, has somehow become the place I go to sell off my old furniture. (If you live in the New York area, I am trying to offload a very nice desk. Priced to move!) As I mentioned in last week’s newsletter, TikTok is increasingly used as a search engine. And Twitter is, well, X. I find myself using it less and less with each passing day.","It doesn’t help that for years now, the name of the platform game has been shameless imitation. Snapchat’s stories are the canonical example, aped so effectively by Instagram that it’s easy to forget where the idea came from in the first place.","More recently, Spotify is leaning into TikTok-style vertical videos, and TikTok is starting its own subscription music service to compete with Spotify. Meta, as you probably know, created an entire clone platform, Threads, to feast on the carcass of post-Elon Musk Twitter. (Also, remember Bluesky?) Musk, for his part, plans to turn X into “the everything app” for messaging, finance and beyond.","He’s certainly not the first person or company with that goal. The tech industry seems to believe there’s a wide appetite out there for a platform that does it all — the best and most useful parts of the social networks and other apps we constantly toggle between every day.","For me, this magical turducken app would combine TikTok’s algorithmic power for serving me hyper-specific videos, the dopamine rush of getting likes on Instagram, the erstwhile ease of using Facebook to invite your friends to a party, the weirdness of Tumblr of yore and, honestly, LinkedIn just as it is. Oh, also Venmo — but everyone’s transactions have to be public so I can stalk them.","The thing, though, is that we, the users, are already out here engineering our own everything apps by inventing and retrofitting additional uses for existing platforms. That’s how you get LinkedIn functioning like a dating app. Or, in the reverse, dating apps becoming a pretty decent place to network.","All apps are everything apps. We built them ourselves.","Here’s what else is happening online this week.","We thought you should know: There is something called #GraveTok.","Samantha Jones is back, baby!When a date rejects you because of your follower count.","See you at Fyre Festival 2. (L.A. Times)Threads is struggling to retain users. (Business Insider)Threads wishes it had a thread this good.","Bama Rush is back, and according to the Opinion columnist Tressie McMillan Cottom, it’s the same as ever.","In the week after the Women’s World Cup, soccer fans doggedly tagged Nike on social media — just not in the way the company might have hoped.","Fans were irate that Nike failed to offer a replica jersey for Mary Earps, the English player who was recognized as the tournament’s best goalkeeper. “She’s in the FIFA Women’s World Cup final & we can’t buy her jersey,” one fan wrote on X. “Absolutely insane.”Nike did not release goalkeeper jerseys for any of the 13 teams it sponsored in the tournament, including England. But as Earps emerged as one of the tournament’s standout players, the uproar led to a motion in British Parliament and several salty comments from Earps herself.","The online pressure just might have paid off. On Wednesday evening, a spokesperson for Nike told me and my colleague Elizabeth Paton that the company would release “limited quantities” of the jerseys.","Fans appear excited by the news, but it may be bittersweet. When you go after a company online, the best-case scenario is that it will adjust course. Nike did. Now, Earps fans have to decide if they still want to fork over money to the company they spent the past week criticizing.","—Callie Holtermann"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/style/social-media-apps.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/24/fashion/Newsletter-64e780a7/Newsletter-64e780a7-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-08-25 16:58:11+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:20.723805+00');

Kircher', 'style', '["Last week, I saw more posts than I could count citing a study that claims Aug. 24 is the day of the year when the most people call out of work sick (or “sick”).","For what it is worth, I have not thoroughly vetted this study. It was conducted by an employee tracking company that offered few details about the scope of its findings, and it’s the sort of too-slick data point that makes me a little wary. But, hey, anecdotally, I believe it. It’s the last gasp of summer. Maybe your office is extra quiet. Maybe your city’s energy feels a little lazier than usual. Maybe it’s just you.","There is a pet theory I’ve long held about the internet. I will disclose upfront that it has absolutely zero scientific merit. The only peer review it has received is me telling my actual peers about it. You are now all my friends.","My theory is that the summer makes for a boring internet. It’s the worst time of year to be online. My feeds of late have felt like they have digital tumbleweeds rolling by.","Which isn’t to say this week hasn’t had its moments. Below, you can read about how former President Donald Trump’s mug shot rapidly became a meme — which, if you know anything at all about the internet, you saw coming from a mile away.","I’ve also recently become obsessed with DJ Mandy, the best/worst D.J. on the internet. Insider called her mash-ups “intentionally gawky.” To even call them mash-ups is an insult to the art of mash-ups. Whatever they are, they’re great. They hurt and satisfy my brain in equal measure.","There’s also this piece from 404 Media about how Amazon is riddled with AI-generated mushroom foraging books that could get somebody killed. It has me terrified in new and fun(gi) ways. (Sorry, sorry.)Even my TikTok likes of late are sleepy. A recipe for potato salad. Tips for how to transfer my credit cards points to an airline rewards program. A video from a stylist who helps people determine what colors look best on them. Yawn!Looking through my likes I realized I’d unintentionally been watching a lot of “Call the Midwife,” a years-old TV show I’m now digesting in short clips from accounts devoted to bootlegging TV shows and movies. The show is heart-wrenching, but not exactly the weird and hyperspecific content I want from TikTok.","Anyway, see you all online next week. Here’s hoping we all get over our late summer malaise.","Here’s what else is happening online this week.","Meet the influencer taking over men’s tennis.","The folding chair used in the Alabama riverfront brawl became a meme — and then a symbol of resistance.","What’s going on with dissociative identity disorder TikTok? (The Verge)Rizz alert. (Wall Street Journal)A new Illinois law requires the parents of underage social media influencers to set aside their earnings. (ABC News)Don’t forget to enjoy the view.","  (TikTok)It has been hard to miss Trump’s mug shot in the past week, that scowling, off-center photo that my colleague Vanessa Friedman described as “a historic image that will be seared into the public record and referred to in perpetuity.” Online, the mug shot is everywhere: It has been memed, yassified and de-aged.","Lately, a truly weird filter has taken off on TikTok that allows people to insert their own facial features into the mug shot. Here’s an example that has more than two million views. People who are fans and opponents of Trump alike are posting videos of in which their faces softly melt into the outline of the mug shot, often with the song “Locked Up” by Akon in the background.","Apparently it’s not enough to repost or even slap a new caption on a viral image anymore. To compete in today’s meme ecosystem, you have to put yourself in the middle of the action.","— Callie Holtermann"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/style/the-internet-takes-some-time-off.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/31/fashion/Newsletter-64f0a650/Newsletter-64f0a650-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-01 13:29:08.2+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:21.187381+00');

the saga of the Tabi Swiper.","The story goes like this:After a second date, a man named Josh went home with a woman named Alexis Dougé for the evening. The following morning, after Josh left, Alexis discovered that her Tabi Mary-Janes — a pricey shoe from the brand Margiela with a polarizing cloven toe — were missing. Alexis posted a TikTok video recapping the situation. It didn’t take the internet hive mind long to identify Josh, who had just given his girlfriend a pair of the same shoes. After a protracted public shaming, Josh came clean and gave Alexis her shoes back. The end!My colleague Jessica Roy interviewed Alexis about the whole mess. Josh, perhaps unsurprisingly, declined to be interviewed.","I’m glad Alexis got her shoes back. There is nothing worse than that powerless and unsettling feeling you get after realizing something has been stolen from you. (I’m still mourning some prized rain boots that were snatched from my gym locker.) But the whole situation has me thinking about Josh as the latest in a line of bad date villains who have been put on blast for the internet to judge.","I’m thinking here about West Elm Caleb, a man who in 2022 found himself TikTok’s main character after a number of women came forward to accuse him of bad dating behavior. Before Caleb was Couch Guy, whose only offense was not getting off a sofa with sufficient enthusiasm when his long-distance girlfriend surprised him in person.","These stories quickly take on a life of their own. Internet vigilantes began tracking Caleb’s real-time location and calling West Elm to demand that he be fired. And the women who accused him soon began getting death threats.","Josh, by his own admission, stole a pair of shoes. That’s not right, he shouldn’t get away with that. But where’s the line? “He took some shoes — he didn’t commit a murder,” Jessica said.","Dougé told Jessica she was constantly being recognized: “They’ll say, ‘Glad you got your Tabis back!’” She also said she had received a surprising onslaught of online hatred.","There’s no easy solution to this pattern. Social media platforms sometimes have the power to deliver justice, but the dark side of the equation seems to be inescapable: vigilantism and harassment for all involved.","Thanks to TikTok’s algorithm, which favors the wild and crazy, it won’t be long before another main character comes along and gets the Couch Guy/West Elm Caleb/Tabi Swiper treatment. Until then, keep an eye on your boots.","Here’s what else is happening online this week.","Montana’s attorney general wants to ban TikTok. Is the state ready?The glamorous, lonely lives of those private chefs you see online.","One way the internet is remembering Jimmy Buffett.","The cool thing about mail.","What if Nintendo’s Toad sang “Temperature” by Sean Paul? You can stop wondering.","For months, I’ve been obsessed with a very particular TikTok genre where people roll bottles down stairs to see if they’ll shatter. Soda bottles. Condiment bottles. Wine bottles. Bottles stuffed with hundreds of tiny balls. Any kind of bottle that will ooze or explode everywhere when it inevitably shatters.","There’s an ecosystem surrounding these videos, too. People film themselves reacting to the bottles. They are strangely satisfying to watch: Oh, that one is gonna make it."," Nope, that cap is gonna pop off right … about … yup, there it goes!This isn’t necessarily a new genre, but perhaps it’s new to you. The biggest accounts — I’m a fan of @RachaPotes on TikTok — have racked up millions of views. Let’s be honest, the videos are conceptually very dumb and a little bit bizarre. That’s what I like about them. Don’t overthink it, just let the sound of shattering glass plinking against stone calm your racing mind.","Have feedback?

Maybe you were complaining about your spouse over a cappuccino in your neighborhood coffee shop. Or loudly talking over the din of the subway about your boss. You love your spouse, and genuinely like your boss, but you just needed to vent a little. Who among us, right? The next day, you open up TikTok to find somebody recapping your conversation in excruciating detail — including the location and your shirt color. Enough detail that your boss or spouse would easily be able to ID you.","This week, I watched an influencer do just that on TikTok. (I’m not going to link in the interest of mercy, but the creator has over 150,000 followers and the video has been viewed nearly 2 million times.) The video’s creator describes overhearing a group of bridesmaids speaking ill of a bride. The creator describes the bridesmaids’ hairstyles, the dresses they wore and even a specific drink that was served at the event — all details she gleaned from eavesdropping. If this video was about your wedding, you’d know immediately.","My immediate reaction: I hope the bride never sees this. Followed by: There’s no way she isn’t going to see this. That’s the way algorithms work, after all. TikTok’s secret sauce is serving up hyper-specific content based on what it thinks you’ll want to watch. In many cases it knows your contacts and location and interests. The “You” in For You Page is very literal.","Turning unsuspecting strangers into social media content is not a new thing. Perhaps you remember the 2018 saga of #PlaneBae, where a woman live-tweeted the interactions — including photos, though she blurred their faces — of a man and a woman sitting in front of her on a plane, dramatizing a meet cute for hundreds of thousands of people watching live online.","By the time the #PlaneBae news cycle ended, the consensus was that the whole mess was creepy and an invasion of privacy — a lesson we clearly still haven’t learned. And how could we, when the drama of strangers, real or imagined, is ripe for content. It’s free. It’s happening right in front of you. It’s a proven virality gold mine.","In 2021, a woman named Marissa Meizz made lemons into lemonade after a stranger overheard her friends discussing excluding her from a birthday party. The stranger posted about it on TikTok and the video eventually made its way to Meizz. In response, she founded No More Lonely Friends, a social community devoted to IRL meetups where people can make new friends.","That’s a happy ending to a story that could easily have been a lot darker. But just because Meizz made the best of it doesn’t mean she should have ever been put in that situation in the first place. As the reach and distribution capabilities of platforms, like TikTok, get even more efficient and far-reaching, we’ve got to reassess the rules of engagement. So much of social media has always been about turning whatever is in front of you into content. That’s the whole point, right? Sharing your life, or some filtered version of your life, as it’s happening. But in those situations, you’re in charge. You decide what version of yourself to present and how much of yourself to share. Strangers who get turned into content don’t have the same control. Be careful out there.","Here’s what else is happening online this week.","We’re texting for work now.","TikTok shop has arrived.","Dietitians on TikTok are telling you what to eat. Many are being paid by the food industry. (The Washington Post)Naming a group chat is not for the faint of heart.","How often do you think about the Roman Empire?According to a recent TikTok trend, some people — more specifically, some men — are thinking about it a lot. “Every day” and “constantly,” these men reply when the women in their lives inquire. The women appear more or less baffled.","What’s going on here? Some historians have argued that there’s a uniquely masculine quality to the warfare and politics of ancient Rome, but I’m not convinced. In other videos with a broader sample, plenty of men say that they don’t think about it all that much. And there are certainly women doing deep and valuable work on the subject (The excellent “SPQR” was written by Mary Beard.)Friends, Romans, countrymen: Help us get to the bottom of this. Send an email to iho@nytimes.com and tell us if you’ve got Augustus stuck in your head.","—Callie HoltermannHave feedback?

first blind dates began, it wasn’t long before some people — mostly men — tried to go out of order so they could talk to the person they were most attracted to.","“There’s a seat right here,” one of the event’s organizers said, steering a wayward attendee back into the designated flow.","Speed dating is no easy feat, requiring the conversational stamina of a filibuster champion, the brevity of an auctioneer and a positive mood to fight the boredom of repetition. Drinks were encouraged.","“I’m a very personable person — I hate texting, I love phone calls,” said N’dack Fleming, 28, who added that she was ready to leave behind her “hookup phase.” “So I was like, OK, this experience is a very personable experience.”The event, called We Met IRL, was created by Maxine Williams as a balm for those who have found it difficult to navigate a sometimes unsavory dating scene in New York City, where endless swiping and lukewarm flings can convince even the most introverted that it’s time to leave the apartment. This summer, We Met IRL was just one of several events that nudged singles out into the real world, uniting them through common interests or kitschy themes, sometimes the more contrived, the better.","Singles events have long asked people to place their hopes for romance in the hands of strangers, promising attendees — if nothing else — the chance to get out of their comfort zones. Many of these events held in New York this summer centered on activities, like ax throwing, or shared interests, like a love of reading.","At a singles party for queer people of color hosted by the queer collective Raw Honey at the Sultan Room in Brooklyn last month, more than 200 attendees showed up to kick off cuffing season. Each person was asked to pick a colored wrist band: Red signaled you were there only to make friends, yellow identified you as polyamorous, and green meant you were single and down to mingle.","Gabrielle Hitchens, the founder of the collective, said that she knew it could be hard for queer people of color “to find each other and connect,” so she wanted to provide a destination for them to do so in a party setting. Between dancing and drinking, many in the room seemed to hit it off, with at least one pair confirming they had a date planned in the days ahead.","Cambria Evans moved to New York City in 2021, and she said she hadn’t yet been able to fully explore the queer community as a bisexual woman in Brooklyn. When she saw a flier for the Raw Honey event on Instagram, she thought it would be a great way to get out of her comfort zone.","“I did see a bunch of people that I was definitely attracted to, but I was definitely too shy to talk to them,” Ms. Evans recalled a few days after the party, which she attended alone. “I am doing things one thing at a time.”A brightly lit room in Williamsburg filled with dog treats, toys and kibble might not be the most obvious setting for flirting and romance. However, dozens of people gathered last week at Boris & Horton, a dog-friendly cafe in Brooklyn, to do just that.","It was a “Must Love Dogs” singles mixer hosted by the Blink Date, a dating app founded by Taly Matiteyahu that schedules 10-minute phone dates for its members with potential matches. A lot of mingling happened among the dozens of guests, but at first, it was mostly the dogs introducing themselves.","Vladimir Manosalvas, who referred to himself as “single like a Pringle,” said he came to the event alone with the intention of meeting dogs and only dogs: “Dogs are love, dogs are life and even though I like people, I mostly came to this mix-and-match event for the dogs.”Allie Shoemaker, who was at the cafe with her two dogs, Itty Bitty and Doodle, came to the event to look for a potential match but didn’t have high expectations. She quoted a Carrie Underwood song that summed up her dating experience: “The more boys I meet, the more I love my dogs.”“The peace I feel right now, that I always wanted to feel with a partner, I feel with them, and that’s OK,” she said.","It’s safe to say that many of us still yearn for a classic meet-cute that online dating cannot achieve. Singles mixers dangle the idea that you might find the one (or at least the person you want to cuff through the fall and winter) over drink specials and a niche theme. The only thing you need is an event link to place you and your future partner in the right place at the right time.","Send your thoughts, stories and tips to thirdwheel@nytimes.com."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/style/singles-events.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/21/multimedia/18WHEEL-EVENTS-01-hvzt/18WHEEL-EVENTS-01-hvzt-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-18 12:00:42+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:23.973788+00');

York’s East River. A minor slip might have been embarrassing. A splash? Nothing short of an international incident.","It had been raining since early morning. Damp onlookers watched the prince toss a few juvenile oysters in a bucket, then wade through waist-deep water until he reached the shore.","Relief was palpable among staff of Billion Oyster Project, a nonprofit aiming to restore oyster reefs to New York’s waterways. The prince’s visit with the organization on Monday had been years in the making: It was postponed last September after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.","This time around, the staff’s preparations included ordering new waders, the type of waterproof overalls worn by fly fishermen. “We were like, what size waders does the prince wear?” Jessi Olsen, the corporate partnerships manager for Billion Oyster Project, said.","“He looked like a natural,” Agata Poniatowski, the organization’s public outreach manager, said. “I believe he’s been in waders before.”Prince William was visiting New York for two days that coincided with Climate Week, a summit on climate action that takes place alongside the United Nations General Assembly. He met with the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, Monday night and on Tuesday, Prince William will announce finalists for the Earthshot Prize, awarded by the climate-focused charity he founded in 2020.","His first stop, though, was a pile of shells on Governors Island. The prince arrived on a silver T-boat, a 28-foot-long passenger vessel. He was accompanied by security personnel with life vests layered over their navy blue suits.","Around 3:30 p.m., he walked into a tennis court-size enclosure to the southeast of the island, where he was surrounded by mounds of oyster shells up to eight feet high.","The shells had been donated by restaurants including Raoul’s and La Marchande, their contents already slurped out by diners. The shells then arrived at Governors Island to be cleaned (and separated from accidental detritus, like hot sauce packets).","Founded in 2014, the project aims to restore one billion live oysters to a harbor where the mollusks once thrived. Some shells are placed directly into New York Harbor to be taken up by oyster larvae, and others are fostered in oyster nurseries. The oysters are intended not to be eaten but to improve the harbor’s biodiversity and to protect the city against flooding.","From a six-foot pile, the prince plucked a shell and rubbed it between his fingers, as if contemplating its potential. According to Pete Malinowski, the executive director of the Billion Oyster Project, it has 130 million oysters down and 870 million to go.","By 4 p.m. the prince was whisked on a blue-and-white golf cart to Pier 101, where the same boat was waiting to carry him to Brooklyn Bridge Park. He maneuvered down a narrow, slippery gangway to the dock. A Coast Guard boat churned through the waves ahead of him — two more bobbed nearby.","Lasting just over an hour, the prince’s visit was hushed, orderly and tightly choreographed — noticeably different from some other displays of climate activism that took place in the city this month.","During the U.S. Open, protesters, one of whom glued his bare feet to the cement, interrupted the semifinal between Coco Gauff and Karolina Muchova. At New York Fashion Week, protesters walked onto the runway at the Coach show. And this weekend, at least 16 climate activists were arrested during a protest at the Museum of Modern Art.","Prince William, who was kept carefully beyond earshot of reporters, could not be asked for comment on the different approaches.","Mr. Malinowski, the Billion Oyster Project director, said he was not aware of the MoMA protest. “I think everyone has to do their part, however they can do it,” he said.","He emphasized that the project teaches young people how to make hands-on improvements to the health of the planet. Staff members teach students at the New York Harbor School, a public high school on Governors Island, about aquaculture, ocean engineering and marine policy.","“There’s not a lot of ways for young people to have a positive impact on the planet,” Mr. Malinowski said. “Most of what we’re taught is how to minimize our negative impact.”Emma Brech, 22, a student who lives on Long Island, had traveled to Governors Island before dawn, hoping for a glimpse of Prince William. The prince’s attention to the climate crisis “gives me more hope for the future,” she said.","As it rained for hours, with no sign of the prince, Ms. Brech huddled under an umbrella printed with the Union Jack. Her patience was rewarded when Prince William waved to her briefly on his way off the island.","“Selfie?” she called out. No response."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/style/prince-william-new-york-east-river.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/18/multimedia/PRINCEWILLIAM-OYSTER-VISIT-jphc/PRINCEWILLIAM-OYSTER-VISIT-jphc-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 10:53:46+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:24.362146+00');

'style', '["“Most of the time, I’m halfway content.”Those words are Bob Dylan’s, and they were delivered one night last week by Brooke Shields during her sold-out debut show at the Café Carlyle, the intimate Manhattan supper club where Bobby Short, Elaine Stritch and Debbie Harry have performed.","It was five months after Ms. Shields had returned to the spotlight with “Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields,” an acclaimed documentary that chronicled the ups and downs of a career that got its start in the 1970s, when she was a child model and actress marketed as a sex symbol.","A number of celebrities came out to see her at the venue, which is blocks away from the Upper East Side apartment where she grew up. At a table close to the stage were the actors Naomi Watts, Billy Crudup and Laura Dern. Nearby sat Mariska Hargitay, whom Ms. Shields has worked with on “Law & Order: SVU.” The crowd also included two men who had done cabaret at the Carlyle: Isaac Mizrahi, who designed the loosefitting orange dress Ms. Shields was wearing, and Alan Cumming.","Whether by design or chance, Ms. Shields, 58, has reflected the mood of the times across her nearly five-decade career. In the louche, druggie ’70s, she starred (at age 11) in “Pretty Baby,” the Louis Malle film about a romantic relationship between an adult man and a child prostitute. In the striving, just-say-no ’80s, she graduated from Princeton and wrote a self-help book for teenagers in which she discussed her decision to remain a virgin.","In the next decade she starred on Broadway (in a revival of “Grease”), displayed a talent for pratfalls in a hit sitcom (“Suddenly Susan”), and married and divorced a tennis star (Andre Agassi). In 2001, she married the comedy writer and filmmaker Chris Henchy, with whom she has had two children, and returned to the Broadway stage in “Chicago.” She has also found time to write memoirs and host a podcast, “Now What.”And Ms. Shields pointed out during the show that somewhere along the course of her varied career: “I performed at Sea World. With Lucille Ball.”Her Café Carlyle residency is scheduled to run through Sept. 23. Every night is sold out. On Tuesday, she opened with “I Think We’re Alone Now,” making it into an ironic lament about how she has rarely felt alone since her mother decided she would be a star.","“I practically came out of the womb famous,” she said, during a spoken-word interlude. “They tell me the doctor asked for a selfie.”She also went through periods when her career seemed to be over: “The other day,” she said from the stage, “I was in the airport and the flight attendant came up to me and said, ‘Oh my God, you’re Caitlyn Jenner!’”In “Fame Is Weird,” a song written for the show by Matthew Sklar and Amanda Green, she moved from her encounters with the public to her experiences with fellow celebrities. In the intro, she said she had turned down Donald J. Trump when he asked her out on a date, but soon conceded that she had consented to Elizabeth Taylor’s request that she pre-chew her gum.","“I chewed it first,” Ms. Shields said, “so I got the better end of the deal.”She also recounted being mean girl-ed by some of the world’s best-known women. When she met Bette Davis at the Oscars, she said, “Hi, I’m Brooke Shields,” to which the star replied, “Yes, you are.” A similar encounter occurred when Ben Stiller brought her to Madonna’s house, Ms. Shields said. The greeting she received from Madonna was curt: “Oh, you.”In many ways, the show seemed like an effort by Ms. Shields to work through her ambivalence about having fallen closer to earth after the years of childhood and teenage stardom. In the second half, she roasted and paid tribute to her mother, Teri Shields, who in the ’70s and ’80s became a focal point for the culture’s misgivings about stage parenting and the sexualization of children in Hollywood.","“She has been in the press almost more than I have,” Ms. Shields said, “and, probably, you all have your opinions of her.”She went on to note that life with her mother, who died in 2012, wasn’t all bad.","“There was a lot of laughter and so much fun,” she said. “She would do really crazy things. She would see a dog tied outside of a store, waiting for their owner to come back, and she would get right down in front of the dog to say, ‘They’re never coming back.’ It was just so sick. It’s dark. But really funny.”She also acknowledged her mother’s alcoholism. “We named a cocktail at the bar for her. Actually, we named several for her,” Ms. Shields said, before getting serious about how much she missed her. She added that one reason she wanted to play the Carlyle was that it was a place her mother had taken her when she was young. “She would be really proud,” she said.","With that, she launched into Mr. Dylan’s melancholy “Most of the Time.”Ms. Shields, who appeared to have a cold, sounded a bit like Bob Dylan as her throat began to give out. She then moved into material about the trials and tribulations of being a wife to Mr. Henchy, who was seated in the audience, and the mother of two teenage daughters, Rowan and Grier. While delivering Tina Dico’s “Count to Ten,” she apologized to a man seated close to the stage, who was catching much of her spit.","Toward the end, she sang “Faith,” a 1987 hit by someone she knew, George Michael. She delivered the lyrics with conviction while also using the song to make a cheeky reference to the nights when she stepped out before the paparazzi in the role of the public girlfriend to Mr. Michael and Michael Jackson.","After the applause, the fashion designer Christian Siriano offered a quick review: “She was great, even though she clearly has Covid.”Moments later, Ms. Shields emerged from her dressing room and went through some quick hellos with friends and well-wishers. A waiter asked her what she would like to drink. “Tequila,” she said, before moving to a corner table for a chat with a reporter.","Told of Mr. Siriano’s thoughts, she said, “I don’t have Covid!” But she said she did have a respiratory ailment that had landed her in the hospital a few days before the show.","Her vocal coach brought her cough drops. Publicists hovered. Ms. Shields explained that her cabaret show began taking shape in the spring. Working with the writer and director Nate Patten, as well as with the musical director Charlie Alterman, she said she wanted to put together an evening that would involve telling her own story truthfully while making it a source of comedy.","She was aware that this was a difficult moment to humanize the people who decided it was appropriate for her to appear in a movie at age 11 as someone whose virginity was auctioned off. Yet her mother was still her mother, and she loved her.","“Ambivalence is where real life happens,” she said. “I mean, the point of it all is that we’re not one thing or the other. We’re human beings, and we’re fraught.”Ms. Shields was asked about her experience with Mr. Trump.","“I was making some movie in the late-90s,” she said. “My phone rang and it was him. He said, ‘You and I should date. You’re America’s sweetheart, and I’m the world’s richest man. People will love it.’ At which point I stifled laughter and said, ‘Thank you, I’m very flattered, but I have a boyfriend and I don’t think he would appreciate me stepping out on him.’ And he said, ‘Well, I think you’re making a big mistake.’ I said, ‘Well, I’m going to have to take my chances.’”Did she not know that George Michael was gay? And did they really go on a date?“A few,” she said. “He was very respectful of my virginity.”“Read the book!” a publicist yelled, referring to “There Was a Little Girl,” the 2014 memoir in which she tells the tale.","Ms. Shields added that, despite the appearance that her relationships with Mr. Michael and Mr. Jackson seemed merely for show, she had real bonds with both of them.","“We had so much fun,” she said. “I wasn’t just a purpose, as a beard. It actually was more than that. The conversations, the fears, the discussions.”The talk turned to her podcast — in which she has spoken with Stacey Abrams, Rosie O’Donnell, Chelsea Handler and Kris Jenner — and the one person she has been itching to get: Britney Spears, who hasn’t given an interview in years.","“I tried very hard to find a way to be the first actual interview,” Ms. Shields said. “And I haven’t gotten it. But I am the only person who could do justice to the reality of the story. Whatever it is.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/style/brooke-shields-cabaret-broadway.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/19BROOKE-SHIELDS-01-pwgj/19BROOKE-SHIELDS-01-pwgj-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 09:01:50+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:24.593772+00');

days before Daniel Lee’s sophomore outing for Burberry, something unexpected happened in the Bond Street subway station. The signs turned blue — Burberry blue, the new very-bright blue that Mr. Lee has decided to make synonymous with his brand — and, instead of reading “Bond Street,” read “Burberry Street.”The Tube takeover, in honor of the opening of Burberry’s redesigned Bond Street store, probably seemed like a brilliant idea on paper. So fun! So alliterative! So symbolic! (Bond Street = London landmark; Burberry = London landmark). The problem was the hordes of travelers who, not yet aware of Burberry blue, got confused and couldn’t figure out where they were.","Sitting in the Burberry show, held in Highbury Fields, North London, an entirely different part of the city, I kind of knew how they felt.","Mr. Lee had been tasked with nothing less than a major reboot of the Great British Brand, with emphasis on the British part. He started with that blue; a new logo that brought back the Prorsum knight, the mounted gallant whose banner, in English, reads “Forward”; and, in his first collection, playing around with the brand’s signature plaid, inflating the pattern to enormous proportions and giving it a grunge-y spin. In his pre-collection earlier this summer, he added a dose of sophistication, torquing it into waves at hemlines in an intriguing way.","Then he changed direction.","This time around, the trench was the star of the show: slick and buttoned-up, big at the shoulder, bound at the hips. Also a print featuring the brand’s hardware — chains and locks and carabiners — snaked itself over silk shirts and scarf dresses, the backs of leather coats, and trousers. (The hardware, in its physical incarnation, was also all over the bags and shoes.) Some dresses had zippers along the seams that could be undone at will to open a sleeve, or raise an eyebrow at exposure to come.","There were some pretty one-shoulder disco-at-the-garden-party dresses with frilly tiers, some great military jackets made from ruched chiffon. But the mood, and palette, was more poker-faced, despite a troika of explosive florals and a blue strawberry print that looked as if someone had dosed the catering stands at Wimbledon.","The TikTok-fodder accessories from last season, like a knitted duck beanie (at least one of which was modeled by a guest this time around) and the rabbit’s foot-on-steroids were nowhere to be seen. It was as if, after catering to the Gen Z set, Mr. Lee had said “All right then,” parked those ideas rather than building on them, and moved his attention to the grown-ups. Whom, it seems, he views as an altogether more cynical bunch, both when it comes to the tropes of “Britishness” and the Burberry archive.","Mr. Lee closed his show with a shirtless male model wearing only a pair of low-slung pants in that Bond Street — sorry, Burberry — blue and a belt with a big Prorsum knight buckle. It was a striking choice. Clothes? Pshaw! Strip ‘em away, and it’s the branding that matters.","Maybe he’s right. Maybe that’s where we are now, in our relations with the nation states in which we live and the labels that dress them. But there’s a depth of emotion that is missing."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/style/burberry-daniel-lee-london-fashion-week.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/19BURBERRY-LFW-08-qhtv/19BURBERRY-LFW-08-qhtv-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 07:47:16+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:24.727813+00');

'By Elizabeth Paton', 'style', '["Working in fashion is no fairy tale — just ask the independent designers in London. They may give the city its reputation as a hub of fearless creativity, but in times of economic upheaval, it is tougher for smaller labels to stay afloat. Once-buzzy names like Christopher Kane and Halpern went out of business this year. And this fall, the fashion week schedule seemed much lighter than in seasons past.","Several rising stars chose not to show their collections, including Nensi Dojaka, S.S. Daley and, after a last-minute cancellation, Dilara Findikoglu. But there was still much to be excited about, with some of the most talked-about shows from newer members of the fashion vanguard on the schedule: the dreamy draping on gowns at Di Petsa and Standing Ground, and the collision of skater grunge and Cornish milkmaids at Chopova Lowena (the label behind the cult carabiner-pleated kilts that seem to be everywhere). And then there was Priya Ahluwalia, who presented sublime prints inspired by unsung heroes of color, past and present, which were based on reporting in The New York Times’s “Overlooked” series.","Plenty of members of the London fashion establishment were also on hand to deliver big moments. Jonathan Anderson came out to play with hoodies and shorts molded from clay, all hunched shoulders and rippled pockets that exaggerated the swagger of youth on the street. Roksanda, London’s queen of color, sent out airy gowns in lilac and lime inspired by monastery frescoes from her native Serbia.","Molly Goddard deconstructed undergarments to reveal the internal structures that hold them — and us — together, to charming effect. And Erdem’s collection, inspired by Deborah Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire, also touched on the idea of the undone. Specifically, the lived-in elegance of the English aristocracy was reflected in oversize coats made from spliced waxed Barbour jackets and Chatsworth house textiles, as well as cocktail dresses made from curtains that once belonged to Debo, one of the late, great chatelaines of Britain.","London may be down, but it is definitely not out. Here is what we saw — and heard — that turned our heads this week.","One figure stalked the London runways this season, and that was the scarlet woman. At 16Arlington, she wore feathery, skintight latex; at Chet Lo, in keeping with the designer’s signature knitting technique, she was cherry red and spiky to the touch. At JW Anderson, she was playful in crochet, and at Supriya Lele and Simone Rocha, she was elegant and ready for after-dark play. The designs were an antidote to all the quiet luxury chat of late. A good red dress will always turn heads. Bye-bye beige.","Ms. Rocha’s show at the English National Ballet studios was strewn with roses, including real stems sewn into the sheer paneling of her dresses, and flowers painted onto models’ faces and limbs. Satin hair bows and ribbon trails danced along the floor. On the models’ feet? Platform Crocs encrusted with chunky crystals and pearls that were inspired by the artist Cy Twombly’s plaster cakes. And the accompanying handbags the models carried looked good enough to eat.","Richard Quinn’s show was dedicated to his father, who died in June. Mr. Quinn is known for his showstopping gowns, and the workmanship this season, including the thousands of crystal droplets that hung like tears, and delicate mesh dresses with embroidered, boned skirts that looked like bird cages, was couture-level. When a weeping Mr. Quinn stepped out for the finale, his mother took him in her arms. The audience then joined her in giving the designer a standing ovation.","On Monday, after weeks of speculation, Chioma Nnadi was confirmed as the successor to Edward Enninful at British Vogue (where Mr. Enninful was editor in chief). Ms. Nnadi, 44, will become the first Black woman to lead the fashion title when she takes up the recast role of head of editorial content next month. Currently, she is the editor of the American Vogue website, and a longtime favorite of Anna Wintour. Her new gig will be a homecoming of sorts, as Ms. Nnadi is London-born.","Matty Bovan knows how to turn heads. He delivered the set of the week when he had his front row guests come backstage for dinner while his models got runway ready. Amid a frenzy of hair and make-up touch-ups, guests ate lobster pot pie and drank Tanqueray cocktails in the crypt of St. Martin-in-the-Fields church, an arm’s reach from models, like Ashley Graham, who were wearing Mr. Bovan’s collaged amalgamations of fabric and form.","Foday Dumbuya, the founder of Labrum, is one to watch. Mr. Dumbuya, who won the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design this year, uses his label to tell stories about African art, fashion and history. This season, his eyes were on the Nomoli figurines of Sierra Leone and Liberia. They were printed on textured shorts suits and rain macs, as well as Samba sneakers and white rubber clogs, as part of a partnership with Adidas. He has just been nominated for the New Establishment men’s wear award, a new category at this year’s Fashion Awards. Watch this space.","For his sophomore show for Burberry, Daniel Lee opted to paint the town blue. Specifically, the British fashion house took over the Bond Street tube station, where platform signs were replaced during fashion week to say “Burberry Street” — a move that baffled scores of tourists and foreigners, who missed their stops.","Not one, but three new museum exhibitions devoted to fashion opened in London last weekend.","“Gabrielle Chanel: Fashion Manifesto,” at the Victoria and Albert Museum, tracks how the woman called Coco became the architect of the modern woman’s wardrobe.","At Somerset House, “The Missing Thread: Untold Stories of Black British Fashion\" tells the story of Black creativity from the 1970s to the present day that was misrepresented or excluded from the mainstream industry narrative, with a particular focus on the archive of Joe Casely-Hayford, who died in 2019.","And at the Design Museum, an ambitious new retrospective centers on pieces from the first collections of some of the city’s best-known designers who were supported by the British Fashion Council’s Newgen talent program. Or, in the case of Alexander McQueen, replicas: Following his 1993 show, the designer left garments, including a pair of his famous “bumster” pants, in garbage bags near a dumpster outside a nightclub because he didn’t want to pay the cloakroom charge. He only remembered the next morning. The clothes were never seen again.","Sarah Mower, the curator of the retrospective, which is called “Rebel: 30 Years of London Fashion,” said that she wanted it to be as much about the culture surrounding the clothes as the pieces in the show. Hence the exhibition is staged with areas dedicated to student design ateliers and grubby nightclub queues, as well as the backstage of a runway show. It is deeply nostalgic but also full of excitement for what might come next in the London fashion scene."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/style/london-fashion-week.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/20/fashion/20LONDON-FASHION-COMBO/20LONDON-FASHION-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 19:38:18+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:25.34382+00');

'By Joseph Bernstein', 'style', '["One afternoon in May 2020, Julia Allison sat in a hot spring near Joshua Tree National Park, crying. A media strategist and tech-world socialite — who in her former life as a New York City journalist and media personality pioneered the sort of internet-driven microfame that we now call “influencing” — Ms. Allison was going through yet another breakup. She wanted to know: What was the point of it all?“This was not the plan,” she remembered thinking. “Thirty-nine and single. What has my life come to?”Then Ms. Allison had an unusual epiphany, even for Joshua Tree: She needed to consult the Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law School, Noah Feldman.","Like Ms. Allison, Mr. Feldman first rose to prominence in Lower Manhattan in the aughts, as a wunderkind constitutional law scholar at N.Y.U. (In 2003, at 33, he advised the Iraqis in writing their Constitution after the U.S. invasion.) Also like Ms. Allison, Mr. Feldman had been unlucky in love, a bachelor since his 2011 divorce.","The two had never talked, but a mutual friend had described Mr. Feldman to Ms. Allison as “the world’s most fascinating man.” Through the friend, she had Mr. Feldman’s number, which she dialed from the hot spring. He picked up, and Ms. Allison asked him the meaning of life. They spoke for 90 minutes.","“Neither of us can remember what Noah said, but I know it was so profound,” Ms. Allison said.","Now, three and a half years later, after a courtship that has been, while not precisely a secret, at least conspicuously discreet, Ms. Allison and Mr. Feldman are engaged.","On the surface, it was an unlikely match. Ms. Allison, 42, is a 10-time Burning Man attendee who had lived in California for a decade; her friends include start-up chief executives and psychedelic psychotherapists; she considers Bali her spiritual home. Ms. Allison described a period of her dating history as “10 years of relationships with polyamorous D.J.s.” (Ms. Allison said she also dated the former Democratic congressman Harold Ford Jr."," when she was a college student at Georgetown.)Mr. Feldman, meanwhile, embodies the East Coast establishment. The son of an M.I.T. professor and a Harvard lecturer who graduated first in his class from Harvard, Mr. Feldman, 53, speaks five languages, has written nine books and is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. (Mr. Feldman has also been a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine.) His first wife, Jeannie Suk Gersen, with whom he has two teenage children, is also a professor at Harvard Law School and a public intellectual.","“People I dated seriously, subsequently, were people of substance,” Mr. Feldman said in a recent interview in his office. “Distinguished in their professions.”Ms. Allison, sitting arm in arm with Mr. Feldman, smiled.","“Serious people,” she said in a stage whisper.","But Ms. Allison’s call came at a time, early in Covid restrictions, when Mr. Feldman — then nearing 50, teaching remotely and spending much of his time alone at home — was questioning the basics of human connection.","“I was not at an optimistic point in my romantic life,” he said. He remembered wondering, “Will anyone ever meet any human ever again?”The pair said they spoke every day for three months after that first call, often for hours at a time. Mr. Feldman invited Ms. Allison to Maine, where he owns a home.","It took some convincing. Ms. Allison was ambivalent about a bicoastal romance, and about the East Coast in general. Though she felt their chemistry was obvious, she was committed to California. Ms. Allison had moved there after a half decade in the late 2000s in which she became a recurring character in the New York gossip pages and was profiled by The Times as a kind of neo-Candace Bushnell — a dating columnist whom people both loved and loved to hate. An attention economy savant, Ms. Allison was perhaps best known as a foil for Gawker, which obsessively, and sneeringly, covered her social life. In exchange, she gained a kind of toxic fame, both hyperlocal and completely global thanks to the internet, which was a harbinger of the culture to come.","“She was too early,” said Taylor Lorenz, the Washington Post tech columnist and chronicler of social media influence. “She predicted it all.”Scarred by the experience, Ms. Allison has been living mostly out of the spotlight ever since. Early in their phone calls, she asked Mr. Feldman not to Google her.","“It’s not a representation of who I even was then, let alone now,” Ms. Allison said.","But eventually, she got on a plane. At the Portland airport, from his car, Mr. Feldman caught sight of Ms. Allison for the first time.","“I saw Julia dancing, alone, in a sundress on this tiny little triangle of grass in the middle of the airport,” he said. “It was a beautiful, moving image of somebody who was sourcing joy entirely internally.”They spent five days together, picking out produce at the farmers’ market, lying in the grass, and, as Ms. Allison put it, “kissing on Noah’s boat.”“I was completely magnetized by this man,” she said.","Still, there was an acculturation process — particularly for Mr. Feldman, who is not really the dance-like-no-one-is-watching type. To begin with, Ms. Allison was immersed in a scene, centered on Burning Man, about which Mr. Feldman knew nothing.","“Many of Julia’s friends have jobs I didn’t know existed until I met Julia,” Mr. Feldman said. “One is a fire dancer. She also has a friend named Purple — he only wears purple, and his métier is bodywork.”“Noah is learning how to have fun,” Ms. Allison said. “But he’s a fast learner.”Ms. Allison took Mr. Feldman on several pilgrimages — acid tests, really — to make sure he could loosen up. First the pair went to the Indonesian island of Bali, where Ms. Allison lived for a year from 2017 to 2018 doing what she referred to as a “yoga and meditation sabbatical,” and which she said she paid for with earnings from her investments in cryptocurrency. (Mr. Feldman was familiar with the island in part through the work of the anthropologist Clifford Geertz, who wrote about the social dynamics at play in Balinese cockfighting.) Mr. Feldman was tense at first, but cycling the village roads north of Ubud, he began to feel himself pleasantly removed from the rigidly intellectual culture of Cambridge, Mass.","“It may be as far away as you can go from Boston,” he said.","Next, in the fall of 2022, came the final exam: Burning Man, the weeklong event where tens of thousands of people gather to camp and revel in the Nevada desert, and worldly accomplishments aren’t supposed to matter.","“To say Noah was having trepidation about Burning Man would be a major understatement,” Ms. Allison said. “He understood it was a requirement. If you’re going to be with me, you have to go to Burning Man. He was vibrating with anxiety.”There, it was Ms. Allison’s turn to behold Mr. Feldman. The law professor had agreed to M.C. some events for Ms. Allison’s camp, which she described as a “matriarchy.” One session featured a woman in a large headdress leading the audience in a mind-body therapy that involved rapidly tapping certain points on the body. As Ms. Allison entered the tent, she saw Mr. Feldman in front of the crowd, tapping himself and repeating the mantra, “I love and accept myself unconditionally.”“It was the best moment of my life,” she said.","Still, for all the changes Mr. Feldman has made, it was Ms. Allison who agreed to pull up stakes. She moved to Cambridge in November of 2021, and last month, she began a master’s program at the Harvard Kennedy School. She said she hoped to work on issues that matter to her: environmental justice, gender issues and animal rights.","Because of her course load, she missed Burning Man this year for the first time in a decade — possibly a sign of kismet in and of itself.","And she has moved into Mr. Feldman’s 5,000-square-foot mansard-roofed home, which she has, with her fiancé’s intermittently enthusiastic participation, redecorated.","“It was a sad, beige house for a sad, beige bachelor,” she said.","Ms. Allison’s changes include whimsical pink wallpaper with a pattern of monkeys and leopards; thick velvet drapes; Balinese statuary; antique chandeliers throughout the house; and a formidably deep, blue velvet couch in the living room, intended to encourage a kind of sensuous lazing that is not typically associated with Cambridge.","Now, Ms. Allison calls the house “the Bohemian Embassy,” and she sends guests a mission statement ahead of time. “Our home is more than dwelling,” the message reads. “It is a confluence of diverse minds and spirits, a space of exploration and enlightenment.” Ms. Allison hopes to turn the house into a place where the free-spirited sensibility of Burning Man can mix with the cerebral culture of Cambridge.","“Noah is a sharp edge that needs to be softened; he is a square that needs to be rounded,” Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, said of his longtime friend. (The two have been close since they were Rhodes scholars together at the University of Oxford.)“This woman is a gift to him, a guy who has been walking a narrow pathway toward extraordinary success all his life,” he continued. “And she was on the side of the road in this wondrous field, filled with wildflowers, and she got him off the path, to dance.”On a recent, humid August evening, the couple hosted a Shabbat dinner to put those hopes into practice. (Mr. Feldman, who is working on a book about the nature of contemporary Judaism, grew up modern Orthodox. Ms. Allison said that she planned to “join Judaism.”) The guest list featured friends of Ms. Allison’s — among them a professional intimacy coach, an entrepreneur who built a high-tech chair for meditation and a professional relationship coach — as well as two friends of Mr. Feldman’s, a physicist and a sociologist.","After a dinner of plank-grilled salmon, prepared by Mr. Feldman, and several glasses of Pouilly-Fuissé, the group retired to the living room. Mr. Feldman, wearing a rakishly unbuttoned pink oxford shirt, reclined on the sofa, where the meditation chair entrepreneur draped her legs across his lap. (Ms. Allison’s Burning Man friends place a premium on physical touch and soft surfaces, a phenomenon they refer to as “bringing the squish.”)Ms. Allison sat on her heels on the floor in front of them, her full-length pink floral dress gathered around her. Topics of conversation included the potential for MDMA to treat trauma, the 19th-century German sociologist Max Weber and the nature of love.","Starielle Hope, the intimacy coach, said that at first she had been skeptical about the match.","“To me they were so different,” she said. “He is a man who is part of a hierarchical system, and she is a woman who is seeking an unconventional life in balmy climates.”Ms. Allison laughed. “These two worlds could do so much together,” she said.","The physicist, reclining in an oxblood Eames lounge chair, offered that the hippies had saved physics, to murmurs of assent. As the evening progressed, he performed sleight of hand.","This summer, Mr. Feldman and Ms. Allison went on a four-country trip to Europe to scout wedding locations. But the couple hasn’t yet set a date. Ms. Allison said that she was simply too busy with school to properly focus on the wedding she envisions.","“I have to plan an event worthy of waiting until 42 to get married,” she said."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/style/julia-allison-noah-feldman.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/20/multimedia/20JULIA-ALLISON-01-wgpl/20JULIA-ALLISON-01-wgpl-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 16:00:18+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:25.884829+00');

rarely seen. “The most famous designer you’ve never heard of,” New York magazine crowed in 2014.","At only 30, he was said to be the man behind the renaissance of Margiela couture, after the brand’s founding designer left the house. A few years later, he was rumored to be the secret sauce in Phoebe Philo’s Céline collections. Then he was spotted at Calvin Klein, helping reinvent it under Raf Simons. His name kept coming up in reference to top designer jobs, but he never took a bow at the end of the runway. He was rarely photographed. He didn’t hang out with celebrities.","“You can’t keep such a talent under wraps,” Suzy Menkes wrote in British Vogue. Except he did.","Until now.","In late 2021 Mr. Blazy, now 39, became the creative director of Bottega Veneta, after its previous designer, Daniel Lee, who had reinvented the brand in only three years, departed under a cloud of rumors about misbehavior and high employee turnover. Mr. Blazy, who had been Mr. Lee’s No. 2, inherited not just his headline gig, but a house shrouded in innuendo and in need of yet another sprinkling of fairy dust. What did he do?He changed leather into denim, flannel, ribbed cotton and knit and fooled everyone. He pulled the rug out from under assumptions in the most gracious way and made the everyday into precious objects that only the wearer really understood. He created a world — one where nothing is quite as it seems — and populated it with an entire assortment of passers-by. He played sleight of hand with the hierarchy of taste.","And he did it so effectively that this month Bergdorf Goodman in New York, which always devotes its fashion week windows to what Linda Fargo, the senior vice president for fashion and store presentation, described as “the best fashion of the season,” filled three of its windows with Bottega — and only Bottega. Two years into the job, Mr. Blazy hasn’t just redefined a brand, he has defined a direction.","Lately there has been a growing rift in the fashion world between designers who make content and designers who make clothes. The content crew considers fashion as a subset of entertainment; the clothes crew sees fashion as a service.","The appointment of Pharrell Williams as creative director of Louis Vuitton men’s wear was in many ways the apotheosis of the content phenomenon, in which what matters is the spectacle and how it resonates through the world. The garments serve as souvenirs that allow you to buy into the experience and advertise your belonging.","Mr. Blazy has become the epitome of an alternative approach: a designer who puts himself second to the products, the people who make them and the people who buy them. “He doesn’t see himself in the driver’s seat of the company,” said François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, the group that owns Bottega Veneta. “He sees himself in the middle of the car.”Which is not to say he doesn’t know exactly where everyone is going.","“I said I wanted to go against the stream of the monovision,” Mr. Blazy said, talking about his initial pitch to Mr. Pinault. He was in his office in the Bottega Veneta headquarters in Milan, wearing a white Patagonia T-shirt and faded jeans.","He told Mr. Pinault he thought Bottega should focus on craft, rather than design; that it should be “a house, not a brand.” That may sound like semantics but is the difference between a garment that advertises its point of origin and a garment that slips seamlessly into a wardrobe. And it was very different from the approach of Mr. Lee, who had made Bottega so associated with a single color — a bright, herbalicious green — that you could identify a piece from blocks away. It also explains a lot about how Mr. Blazy approaches not his job, but the world.","When he moved into his office, which was a white box, he had the walls repaneled in wood tinted a rich brown so they looked like a “chalet in Chamonix,” and the room felt more domestic. Now it is anchored at one end by a seating area with an Isa Genzken Nefertiti head on a pedestal and, at the other, by a long table for meetings. The table has a bowl of Ricola lemon mint lozenges, but no computer.","“I did not open a computer for the last six months,” Mr. Blazy said. “I have two, but I don’t use them so much. I sketch a lot and talk a lot and look at books, and I have a phone.” On the floor, below enormous windows, were 16 different piles of paper, each one corresponding to a different collection or project: perfume, new store concepts, the fanzines he creates with people he admires (most recently the British designer Hussein Chalayan, which involved Mr. Chalayan playing with pen and ink, watercolor and glitter to draw pieces from Mr. Blazy’s last show).","On the walls were a series of artworks. Mr. Blazy collects first drafts. It started, he said, because that’s all he could afford, and he liked the idea that they were “the first expression of something.” Then, he said, he couldn’t stop.","“It’s not that I need to have more more more,” he said. “But two or three times a year I try to find something that makes me happy to live with. I would rather have my money on the wall than in the bank.”When he likes something — Marlboro Lights (he smokes a pack a day); stracciatella (the ice cream with tiny shavings of chocolate that he loves so much he had a special rug designed in its image for his last show; it is now in his office); the Gaetano Pesce chairs he commissioned for the show before that — he whispers, “It’s wonderful,” and his eyes light up like a 10-year-old seeing snow for the very first time.","“He can get inspired by anything,” said Pierre Debusschere, the image and music director for Bottega, who is a close friend. It is not a coincidence that one of Mr. Blazy’s favorite sites in Milan is the Church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro, which features a “false apse” that from the front appears to recede into the distance but up close turns out to be a flat wall painted in trompe l’oeil.","The way Raf Simons, the co-creative director of Prada, who has been Mr. Blazy’s boss twice, and is one of his closest friends, puts it is: “Matt is very free in his head. He has no fear of showing anything he believes in creatively. He always had so many ideas: Add latex kitchen gloves! What about a marching band jacket? Some made completely no sense, and some were so genius I would say, ‘Of course, we are going to do that.’”“In the past I’ve been proposed a few beautiful houses,” Mr. Blazy said, talking about job offers that came his way before Bottega Veneta. He wouldn’t name names, saying only that “one was very beautiful, about craft, one was very commercial but still about fashion, and one was a smaller house that I thought could be reactivated without being passé. But I never felt it was the right time. I saw a lot of designers taking stuff quickly, and for me it was important to build myself first. I wanted to know my job. Know myself.”Mr. Blazy grew up in Paris. His father is an expert in pre-Columbian art, and his mother a historian and researcher; he has an older brother who is an airplane pilot and a twin sister who works in Singapore. He was a rambunctious kid — so much so that when he was 13, his parents sent him to a Marist school in the French countryside, and when that didn’t take, to Pangbourne College, a military boarding school in England for a year. (He said he liked it.)He thought about going into archaeology but ended up at La Cambre, the fashion school in Brussels, because his mother thought it would be good for him to have a skill; Julien Dossena, the creative director of Rabanne, was in his class; Anthony Vaccarello, the creative director of Saint Laurent, was a year above. His graduate collection was about Claudie Haigneré, the first Frenchwoman in space, who became the minister of science, and involved “big fur coats covered in silver fabric,” Mr. Blazy said. “I had a lot of fun.”Mr. Simons liked the collection so much he offered Mr. Blazy a job at his namesake label as a men’s designer. Another designer named Pieter Mulier was already working there, and he and Mr. Blazy soon became a couple.","“We did everything together,” Mr. Simons said. “Go to fabric fairs in Paris, go to the movies, go on vacation.”Four years later, however, and still in his 20s, Mr. Blazy jumped to the Margiela Artisanal collection, that brand’s equivalent of couture. That’s where he began to experiment with the idea of transformation; using one kind of material (plastic hair combs) to represent another (fringe).","“I could really use my passion digging, being curious,” he said. But, he said, he was worried he would be pigeonholed as a conceptualist, so he ended up hopscotching to Céline, when Phoebe Philo was creative director, to work on the more commercial precollections and, from there, to Calvin Klein, where he teamed up with Mr. Simons and Mr. Mulier once again.","It was, Mr. Blazy said, like a “high school reunion. It was very romantic. We’re going to meet new people, we’re going to live in New York.”He and Mr. Mulier rented a weekend place in Connecticut and got a rescue puppy called John John.","But then the Trump election happened, and the Calvin collections became less about the American dream than the American nightmare, somewhat to the dismay of PVH, the conglomerate that owned Calvin Klein. Mr. Simons and his inner circle were fired abruptly after two years.","“It was hell,” Mr. Blazy said. “Like when you have your boxes on the street. It’s something you see in movies, and then you are the main character.”He thought about leaving fashion. Instead he ended up going to Los Angeles to help the artist Sterling Ruby with a collection he showed during the Pitti Uomo trade fair, in Florence.","That’s when Daniel Lee, who had been the design director at Céline when Mr. Blazy was there and had just been tasked with updating Bottega Veneta, came calling. And though Mr. Blazy had reportedly gotten fed up with Mr. Lee’s erratic leadership and resigned following a show in Detroit (he declined to discuss the situation), when Leo Rongone, the chief executive, was looking for Mr. Lee’s replacement, “It was clear we had the right person already here.”Mr. Blazy approached Bottega Veneta with two goals: First, to challenge himself to make something that is wearable. “Because we are expensive, it should be an investment,” he said. And second, to interact with the world we live in. “Timeless is a word I just cannot hear anymore,” he said. “It’s more about a responsibility we have as designer to offer something that lasts.” But also is not boring.","The first thing he did was reduce the size of the design teams so that everyone could sit around the same table. Then he involved the craftspeople (the leather workers and fabric developers) in every conversation.","“He knows everyone’s name,” Mr. Rongone said. “He listens to everyone.” He brought a “new mood” to the studio, Mr. Pinault said. That’s how those leather jeans — “the first thing I asked for on the first day in the first meeting,” he said — came about.","The first response was “not possible,” Mr. Blazy said. Then the teams started going through test after test — about 30 to 40 of them, he said — until one day his staff brought him a sample, “and I thought it was cotton,” he said. “I’ll always remember that day.” Those “denim” jeans, which cost $6,900, sold out in two weeks, Mr. Blazy said.","Mr. Blazy believes in products that serve a function, like the Andiamo bag, a practical intrecciato style that Mr. Rongone said has become Bottega’s best-selling item, and products that are unique, like a “sardine bag” from the last collection that comes with a Murano glass handle shaped like a Brancusi fish. No two handles are exactly alike (though there is a more accessible brass version). Twenty-five such bags were produced, costing $11,000 each, of which Bergdorf got three — “and they sold immediately,” Ms. Fargo said. At this stage, said Mr. Pinault, Bottega is close to becoming the third largest brand in the group, just after Gucci and Saint Laurent, and vying with Balenciaga.","“Even their most commercial pieces are special,” Ms. Fargo said. “We’re all in on it.”Mr. Blazy recently got his own apartment in Milan, after surfing a series of Airbnbs. (Mr. Mulier, now the creative director of Alaïa, and Mr. Blazy split up earlier this year; they are friends and share custody of the dog, though the breakup is still too hard for him to talk about.) The apartment, at the top of a 1960s Modernist building, looks a bit like a houseboat inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright: dark wood, slanted ceilings, with a step up on one side to a tiny balcony that is covered in greenery.","“I walked in and thought, ‘This looks familiar,’” Mr. Blazy said. It turned out he was renting the same apartment Mr. Simons had rented for a time during a stint as creative director of Jil Sander from 2005 to 2012.","He shares the flat during the week with Mr. Debusschere. They have music planning meetings in the kitchen late at night over drinks, and more corporate meetings in the morning, looking over the roofs of Milan and drinking coffee. Mr. Blazy often brings art from his house to his office, and vice versa. He shot the most recent Bottega ad campaign in the courtyard of the apartment, featuring Mariacarla Boscono and his very stoic looking doorman.","Lately he has been thinking a lot about nature. “I’m interested in fish,” he said to his team. “Can we look at birds? I saw this woman in the street. She was walking with double shorts. I think it’s interesting. Can we try? Maybe it’s too perfect. Can we try to make it less perfect?” And so on.","When they are in the studio, he said, he asks his team, “Would you wear this?” Sometimes they say no. Then, he asks them, “Why did you design it?”Last season he began styling his shows himself, which he will do again this season. “I would rather make my own mistakes,” he said.","He is glad he took his time in stepping forward. “Because now, even if I doubt, I know a question mark can become not just ‘I don’t know,’” he said. “It can become an adventure.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/style/matthieu-blazy-bottega-veneta.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/21/multimedia/20BLAZY-01-pbvq/20BLAZY-01-pbvq-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 09:00:35+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:26.913771+00');

Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, announced on Monday a relaxation of the “informal dress code” in the chamber.","The outcry was swift, with 46 Republican senators signing on to a letter condemning the shift. “Allowing casual clothing on the Senate floor disrespects the institution we serve and the American families we represent,” they wrote.","But even though the Senate prides itself on a tradition of decorum, expectations of dress in the chamber have been largely governed by norms, rather than by written rules.","That flexibility has allowed for notable deviations from the buttoned-up status quo throughout the years. In the late 1990s, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi instituted Seersucker Thursday as a nod to the days before air conditioning, when Southern senators introduced their colleagues to the miracle of seersucker, a lightweight, puckered fabric that helped make the muggy Washington summer more endurable. (Seersucker Thursday was also a reminder, according to Mr. Lott, that “the Senate isn’t just a bunch of dour folks wearing dark suits.”)The most recent guidance, which fell to the Senate’s sergeant-at-arms to enforce, called for business attire while on the Senate floor. For the most part, that has been interpreted by men to mean suits (navy and gray are favorites) and ties (often red or blue, depending on party affiliation). Women have gravitated toward pantsuits or jackets, but a 2019 amendment to the dress code opened the door to sleeveless dresses and was quickly embraced by senators including Kyrsten Sinema.","Shortly after Mr. Schumer’s announcement on Monday, Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who has traditionally favored Chanel-style suits while representing Maine in the nation’s capital, joked that she planned “to wear a bikini tomorrow to the Senate floor.”Had she followed through, she would have almost certainly taken some of the heat off Senator John Fetterman, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who just months into his freshman term pivoted from suit and tie to hoodie and basketball shorts.","Here’s a look at how the august upper chamber of the United States Congress has evolved from the days of powdered hair to pastel wigs."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/style/senate-dress-code.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/20/multimedia/SENATE-FASHION-PHOTOS-01-plwf/SENATE-FASHION-PHOTOS-01-plwf-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-21 11:02:27+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:28.170655+00');

richest person, the author tries to make sense of the billionaire entrepreneur he has shadowed for two years — sitting in on meetings, getting a peek at emails and texts, engaging in “scores of interviews and late-night conversations.” Musk is a mercurial “man-child,” Isaacson writes, who was bullied relentlessly as a kid in South Africa until he grew big enough to beat up his bullies. Musk talks about having Asperger’s, which makes him “bad at picking up social cues.” As the people closest to him will attest, he lacks empathy — something that Isaacson describes as a “gene” that’s “hard-wired.”Yet even as Musk struggles to relate to the actual humans around him, his plans for humanity are grand. “A fully reusable rocket is the difference between being a single-planet civilization and being a multiplanet one”: Musk would “maniacally” repeat this message to his staff at SpaceX, his spacecraft and satellite company, where every decision is motivated by his determination to get earthlings to Mars. He pushes employees at his companies — he now runs six, including X, the platform formerly known as Twitter — to slash costs and meet brutal deadlines because he needs to pour resources into the moonshot of colonizing space “before civilization crumbles.” Disaster could come from climate change, from declining birthrates, from artificial intelligence. Isaacson describes Musk stalking the factory floor of Tesla, his electric car company, issuing orders on the fly. “If I don’t make decisions,” Musk explained, “we die.”By “we,” Musk presumably meant Tesla in that instance. But Musk likes to speak of his business interests in superhero terms, so it’s sometimes hard to be sure. Isaacson, whose previous biographical subjects include Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs, is a patient chronicler of obsession; in the case of Musk, he can occasionally seem too patient — a hazard for any biographer who is given extraordinary access. At one point, Isaacson asks why Musk is so offended by anything he deems politically correct, and Musk, as usual, has to dial it up to 11. “Unless the woke-mind virus, which is fundamentally anti-science, anti-merit and anti-human in general, is stopped,” he declares, “civilization will never become multiplanetary.” There are a number of curious assertions in that sentence, but it would have been nice if Isaacson had pushed him to answer a basic question: What on earth does any of it even mean?Isaacson has ably conveyed that Musk doesn’t truly like pushback. Some of his lieutenants insist that he will eventually listen to reason, but Isaacson sees firsthand Musk’s habit of deriding as a saboteur or an idiot anyone who resists him. The musician Grimes, the mother of three of Musk’s children (the existence of the third, Techno Mechanicus, nicknamed Tau, has been kept private until now), calls his roiling anger “demon mode” — a mind-set that “causes a lot of chaos.” She also insists that it allows him to get stuff done.","It’s a convenient assessment, one that Isaacson seems mostly to accept. “As Shakespeare teaches us,” he writes, “all heroes have flaws, some tragic, some conquered, and those we cast as villains can be complex.” Well, yes — but couldn’t this describe anyone? What is there to say specifically about Musk himself?For that we can turn to Isaacson’s reporting, of which there is plenty. (Another thoroughly reported biography, by Ashlee Vance, was published in 2015 — four years before SpaceX started launching Starlink satellites and seven years before Musk acquired Twitter.) Isaacson even managed to get Errol, Elon’s intermittently estranged father, to talk — though mostly what Errol offers are rambling bigoted comments (while insisting he isn’t racist) and self-aggrandizing tales (at least one of which turns out to be “provably false”).","Errol has two children with his stepdaughter. As for Elon, he has 10 children with three women, one of whom — Shivon Zilis, who bore his twins in 2021 — is an executive at one of his companies. (Another child, Musk’s first, born in 2002, died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome when he was 10 weeks old.)“He really wants smart people to have kids,” Zilis said of Musk, who offered to be her sperm donor so that, Isaacson adds, “the kids would be genetically his.” At the time, Grimes and Musk were expecting their second child, a girl. Musk didn’t tell Grimes that he had just had twins with one of his employees.","But the details of such domestic intrigues are, in the book and in Musk’s life, largely beside the point. He is mostly preoccupied with his businesses, where he expects his staff to abide by “the algorithm,” his workplace creed, which commands them to “question every requirement” from a department, including “the legal department” and “the safety department”; and to “delete any part or process” they can. “Comradery is dangerous,” is one of the corollaries. So is this: “The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.”Still, Musk has accrued enough power to dictate his own rules. In one of the book’s biggest scoops, Isaacson describes Musk secretly instructing his engineers to “turn off” Starlink satellite internet coverage to prevent Ukraine from launching a surprise drone attack on Russian forces in Crimea. (Isaacson has since posted on X that contrary to what he writes in the book, Musk didn’t shut down coverage but denied a request to extend the network’s range.) Musk decided that he was saving humanity from a nuclear war. When Ukraine’s vice prime minister texted him to say that Starlink service was “a matter of life and death,” Musk instructed him to “seek peace while you have the upper hand.”Counseling the Ukrainians to “seek peace” sounds especially rich coming from someone who is “energized,” Isaacson says, by “dire threats.” But then the overall sense you get from this biography is that for all of Musk’s talk about the world-changing magic of “the algorithm,” he ultimately does what he wants. He will order his companies to scrimp fanatically on some things while insisting that they spend lavishly on others. At Tesla, Musk’s obsession with the minutiae of automotive design inflated costs and drained the company of cash. At SpaceX, instead of spending $1,500 for the kind of latch used by NASA, an engineer figured out how to modify a $30 latch intended for a bathroom stall. When Musk acquired Twitter last year, he eliminated 75 percent of the staff.","Since Musk’s acquisition, hate speech on the platform has proliferated while ad sales have plunged. Reading this book, one begins to wonder if the old bird-site will be Musk’s Waterloo. “He thought of it as a technology company,” Isaacson writes, “when in fact it was an advertising medium based on human emotions and relationships.” Isaacson believes that Musk wanted to buy Twitter because he had been so bullied as a kid and “now he could own the playground.” It’s an awkward metaphor, but that’s also what makes it perfect. Owning a playground won’t stop you from getting bullied. If you think about it, owning a playground won’t get you much of anything at all.","ELON MUSK | By Walter Isaacson | Illustrated | 670 pp. | Simon & Schuster | $35"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/09/books/review/elon-musk-walter-isaacson.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/24/books/review/24Isaacson-MAIN/24Isaacson-MAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-09 16:17:24+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:28.363773+00');

CoetzeeThe South African writer J.M. Coetzee’s novels are slim, and so, by and large, are his characters — they’re Modiglianis, not Boteros. The most wraithlike, a saintly hunger artist, is the protagonist of his novel “The Life and Times of Michael K,” which won the Booker Prize in 1983.","When an ample person does show up in Coetzee’s work, moral stigma is often attached. Take the hapless “plump” boyfriend in “Diary of a Bad Year,” from 2007, or the lesbian daughter of the canceled professor John Lurie, in the riveting novel “Disgrace” (1999). She’s a farmer. Lurie takes her fleshiness as a sign she’s fled the strictures of civilized intellectual life. Coetzee isn’t known for his humor, but Lurie takes a parched stab at a joke: “Sapphic love: an excuse for putting on weight.”Coetzee’s gravid new novel, “The Pole,” presents readers with another of his rawboned and priapic older men, unable to dampen the lust that plagues and shames them. This time he is Witold Walczykiewicz, a concert pianist from Warsaw whose name has so many w’s and z’s and c’s in it that many people simply call him “the Pole,” as if he were a talking erection. (Coetzee’s name is similarly hard to pronounce. I discovered last week, even though I had my intonation from a good source, that I’ve been saying it wrong for years. It’s koot-SEE, not koot-SEE-uh.)Witold is 70, with a mane of silver hair. He’s craggy, severe, cadaverous. He records for Deutsche Grammophon. Hulked over his piano, he is said to resemble both an enormous spider and Max von Sydow. “The Pole” is about what happens when he travels to give a concert in Barcelona. There he becomes besotted with Beatriz, a name out of Dante. She’s a wealthy, graceful and married arts patron. He begins to pursue her, from near and far. She thinks: “An old man in love. Foolish. And a danger to himself.” She does not need him in her life. Or does she?This is a simple thread on which to hang beads of perception. Coetzee, who is 83, retains a sure touch. This is a convincing late-period novel. If it doesn’t rank with this Nobelist’s finest work, it is no embarrassment. It’s a pared-down book that avoids the excess philosophizing that has dragged down some of his more recent novels.","Among this book’s themes is the nature of austerity itself. Witold is a well-known and controversial interpreter of Chopin, and a stony one. He does not transport his audiences, and he is said to rarely smile. Coetzee too is famous for his stoniness, as felt in his disinterest in scene-setting. But there’s a dryly funny moment in this novel in which you sense the author sending himself up. Describing a pleasant autumn day, he writes: “The leaves are turning, et cetera.” That “et cetera” is impatient Coetzeen for “yada yada yada.” Like urine drawn from a catheter, Coetzee’s descriptions are a thin stream.","Mortality has been on Coetzee’s mind since he was scarcely in middle age. His men fear falling into sexual nonentity. Beatriz, who is two decades younger than Witold, isn’t immune to such concerns. Her husband has affairs; they no longer share a bed. She thinks about Witold’s hands. Does the size of men’s hands give them an advantage at the piano? Her thoughts progress:She has not given much thought to hands before, hands that do everything for their owners like obedient, unpaid servants. Her own hands are nothing special. The hands of a woman who will soon be 50. Sometimes she discreetly hides them. Hands betray one’s age, as does one’s throat, as do the folds of one’s armpit.","In her mother’s day, a woman could still appear in public wearing gloves. Gloves, veils, hats: last traces of a vanished epoch.","This is a book about conversation, about what one says versus what other people hear. It’s a book about translation. Witold and Beatriz are forced to converse mostly in English, a second language for each of them. A lot is lost in translation. Unable to communicate his love to his satisfaction, Witold eventually turns to writing.","This is also a book about philanthropy and charity. The world is in flames and our notion of a noble deed is flying in a disgruntled pianist?The novel asks: What does it mean to lead a good, or successful, life? How much of an impression does one have to make? Witold is an artist. He asserts his worth. He says things like, “Happiness is not the most important … the most important sentiment.” (The ellipses are Coetzee’s.) “Anyone can be happy.”Beatriz is intelligent and well educated, but she fears she is not taken seriously. Here again, hunger and seriousness intertwine. While he was born in Poland during World War II, she was born in 1967. “In 1967 no one in Europe had to eat cabbage soup: no one in Poland, no one in Spain. She has never known hunger. Never. A blessed generation.”She is proud of her sons. She thinks, “Is it enough to have propelled two such well-fed, energetic young male beings into the world?” Perhaps it isn’t. Perhaps this is why she becomes entangled with Witold. Or maybe it is simply existential pity, or insecurity. Past a certain age, every attempt at bedroom romance is an experience one can file under the heading “Naked and Afraid.”THE POLE | By J.M.

Alexandra Jacobs', 'entertainment', '["POCKETS: An Intimate History of How We Keep Things Close, by Hannah CarlsonThis review of Hannah Carlson’s cultural study of pockets was grievously delayed. Why? Your critic lost her keys … again. No, they weren’t AirTagged.","Before the little jinglers were located, shoved in a side compartment of the carrier my family had used to adopt two distracting kittens, I was positive they’d been dropped in the parking lot of the animal shelter, two hours away upstate, and was anxiously strategizing how to coax the overworked staff into conducting a search.","But a friend, whose wife is always losing things, had reassured me that the keys would be found closer to home. “They’re usually in a pocket,” he said with the natural calm of someone whose clothing comes generously outfitted with them. In other words, a man.","“Pocket sexism” is a central tenet of Carlson’s book, whose topic might sound so mundane as to be a parody, à la that musical number about stools in Christopher Guest’s 1996 masterpiece “Waiting for Guffman.” Like envelopes or test tubes, pockets are defined by empty space. Without contents they are nothing but potential: a merely ornamental pocket being commentary at best, deeply frustrating at worst. They are waiting for stuff.","Carlson, a lecturer in dress history at the Rhode Island School of Design, painstakingly traces how the acquisition of pockets was — and to some extent still is — a rite of passage in Western culture for boys but not girls. “She has THINGS TO HOLD, like rocks and Power Rangers,” she quotes one mother imploring clothing manufacturers in a viral tweet about the deficit in her toddler’s wardrobe. “She’s resorted to putting stuff down her shirt.”For at least 100 years, American magazines, fiction and art depicted with affectionate wonderment the oddments young lads might Tom Sawyerishly shove into the sides of their pants, from pennywhistles and knives, to marbles and bottle caps, to a live rat or turtle. But not their own hands, authority figures scolded, as this would bring them all too close to the genitals — though such a gesture eventually came to signal “insouciance and outlaw cool.”James Dean and his jeans!, I thought immediately. They’re not in these pages, far more highbrow and thoughtful than your standard-issue fashion monograph; nor are the members of the Lollipop Guild in “The Wizard of Oz,” thrusting thumbs down into their functional breeches after their feminine counterparts, the Lullaby League, twirl away in decorative tutus.","Walt Whitman is here, upending and offending the upright Victorians with his revolutionary frontispiece portrait for “Leaves of Grass,” hand defiantly in pocket. So is Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, swimming with his clothes stuffed full of biscuits. Unlike female kangaroos, human women (and other historically second-class citizens) have alway had a harder time securing storage close to their person. Emily Dickinson was one of the few who argued successfully with her dressmaker to get a compartment for pencil and paper. She “had a room of her own — and a reliable pocket,” Carlson writes.","Such modifications are rare in America, where the feminine silhouette has been so sacrosanct that even the coats of the Women’s Army Corps in World War II lacked adequate storage. “Did even a pack of cigarettes threaten to disfigure the breast, making it lumpy and misshapen, a sort of metaphor for servicemen’s worst fears — that after joining the army, women would no longer be recognizable as women ?” the author wonders.","And yet the small addition of a pocket can represent freedom in its most resonant sense. The author tells of runaway slaves tailoring their garments to better elude capture: adding “functional space useful in flight while also critically transforming a mean livery of slavery — pocketless coats — into more distinguished, worldly garb.”Pockets have long amounted to privilege, and once you start noticing their presence, or their conspicuous absence, you won’t be able to stop. “Deceitful men all their 20 pockets aren’t enough for their lies” Molly Bloom thinks in the final soliloquy of “Ulysses,” as another friend (female), who once took the trouble to sew some into a vintage fleece jacket, reminded me. In her memoir of Susan Sontag, Sigrid Nunez wrote of the older woman perplexed by purses and refusing to carry one.","But the line between purse and pocket is porous, which makes for some taxonomic confusion. Handbags can also be legally searched by police, in instances when pockets can’t, and may even serve as weapons (think of the neo-Nazi ambushed by “The Woman with the Handbag” in the famous Swedish photo). I have watched in fascination as the fanny pack has migrated militaristically upward to become a unisex crossbody sling.","As technology advances, any body-adjacent storage seems increasingly antique. Carrying around anything but the absolute essentials (“to date, no one has invented a digital form of the handkerchief,” Carlson points out) has gone from marker of prosperity to commonness. We’re already well on our way to pocketlessness with smartwatches and digital wallets; in the future, maybe we’ll just incline our heads at the door rather than being burdened with keys.","In the meantime, if the popular read-it-later app Pocket doesn’t aggregate this article, I’ll eat my hat.","POCKETS: An Intimate History of How We Keep Things Close | By Hannah Carlson | Illustrated | 320 pp. | Algonquin Books | $35"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/10/books/review/pockets-hannah-carlson-fashion-history.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/15/books/10CARLSON-REVIEW/00BOOK-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-10 09:00:38+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:29.483769+00');

projects are vast creatures of shocking complexity,” a real-estate developer none-too-humbly notes early in Hill’s new novel, “Wellness” — “intricate, unruly, asynchronous, a little baroque.” Given the vastness of the 600-page book that follows, one can’t help imagining the author is supplying a would-be ars poetica of his own.","Compared with Hill’s kaleidoscopic, best-selling debut, “The Nix,” with its dives into 1960s radicalism, gaming culture and contemporary campus politics, “Wellness” seems at first to promise something more grounded and lived-in. Set in 2015, it chronicles the mid-marriage malaise of Jack and Elizabeth, he a photographer and adjunct art professor, she the proprietor of, well, Wellness, a company once dedicated to debunking fad diets and other health scams but now in the business of tricking people into happier lives through the deployment of placebos. (Her signature product is a fake love potion that claims to improve troubled marriages.) The couple’s sex life has stagnated; they’ve spent their savings on a fancy, as-yet-unbuilt condo in the Chicago suburbs; and their 8-year-old son Toby’s struggles with socializing and impulse control are stressing them out.","The ingredients are in place for a Franzen-esque exploration of The Way We Live Now, and, at least for a while, this is what the book delivers. Elizabeth befriends a younger mother at Toby’s school who evangelizes for polyamory in terms that will be familiar to readers of Esther Perel; another new friend leads a group dedicated to the law of attraction and the practice of manifesting their desires. Jack argues with his father about Ebola conspiracy theories on Facebook and is subjected at his university to an only-just-implausible new regime in which a professor’s pay is tied to the amount of social media engagement he generates.","Hill’s treatment of various forms of contemporary groupthink approaches but isn’t quite parody (except in the case of the law of attraction group, who are soon unmasked as vicious, and oddly moralistic, idiots). The novel reproduces at great length many of the most irritating aspects of contemporary white-collar life — teeth-grinding human-resources jargon and tech speak, vapid behavioral psychology — sometimes to poke mild fun at it, but often in seeming earnest. “So the brain — which is still operating a Paleolithic simulation set atop our 21st-century world — does a cost-benefit analysis: It will only spend the energy needed to cure you when it is certain there is enough energy to go around, when it is certain you are safe from harm,” Elizabeth’s mentor explains. After another page of this, Elizabeth deduces: “Information overload is the new hungry lion.” Hill cites his sources in an extensive bibliography at the end — pages and pages of books and articles both popular and academic, from “Sex at Dawn” and Jaron Lanier to a wide array of scientific studies about picky eating among infants and toddlers, as though he’s anxious we might think he’s making any of this up.","It’s a tall order to wrestle so much secondhand material into something emotionally resonant, and, intentionally or not, the same pop psychology Hill examines — with its tendency toward simple, all-encompassing solutions — pervades the novel’s own logic. Franzen’s moralism can be irritating, but at least his pervasive skepticism gives him a solid foundation from which to critique the culture he writes about. Hill’s disposition is fundamentally sanguine — if one’s pay gets linked to social media hits, the solution is to go viral.","As in “The Nix,” though, Hill is less interested in getting to the bottom of the modern predicament than he is in constructing an elaborate, back-story-laden plot machine that will, after hundreds of pages, solve all its characters’ problems with a series of satisfying clicks. In both novels, Hill intertwines past and present with militaristic precision, revealing the ways his characters’ histories come to bear inexorably, unambiguously on their present lives. “Every life has a moment like this, a trauma that breaks you into brand-new pieces,” Hill writes in “The Nix,” and though I have my doubts about the truth of this credo, his work consistently bears it out. If you indirectly cause a police officer to become grievously injured in the 1968 Chicago police riots, you better believe he’s going to be a judge in your case after you throw rocks at a presidential candidate in 2011.","In “Wellness,” despite the gestures toward a broader analysis of the world’s workings (as in a breathless summation of Elizabeth’s family’s rapacious and racist wealth accumulation, or a chapter explaining how social media algorithms work), the character’s lives are governed almost entirely by coincidences and misunderstandings. Jack’s obsession with early internet pornography is mistaken for a brilliant art project; Toby reveals that he failed the famed “marshmallow test” on purpose in a misguided attempt to please his mother. In Hill’s philosophy, Occam’s razor is never applied.","The eternally looming progenitor of this kind of simultaneously mechanistic and sentimental storytelling is, of course, Dickens. But despite creaky (often deeply pleasurable) formal conventions, the great 19th-century novelists ushered in the modern novel by imbuing their narratives with psychological ambiguities that can’t be fully resolved, even by the revelations that superficially conclude their plots.","Hill, on the other hand, is so dogged about connecting narrative dots that he loses sight of the messiness of lived reality. As in serialized television, or movies like “Babel” and “Crash,” the suspense in his books is generated almost entirely by the withholding of important information about characters’ pasts and motivations, often at the expense of psychological plausibility, like when an important long-term relationship is revealed to have begun, unbeknown to one of partners, as a sociological experiment. Hill’s use of this form of narrative trickery is especially egregious given the novel’s roving third-person narration, which purports to access both Jack and Elizabeth’s perspectives.","There are lovely passages in “Wellness” that prove Hill capable of clear, intelligent writing — as when Jack visits the Art Institute of Chicago and close-reads Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” and an obscure painting called “The Prairie on Fire,” “a scene from the Kansas prairie painted by someone who had never been to Kansas, based on a novel by someone who had also never been to Kansas.” Hill’s storytelling abilities are impressive, if maddening, and underneath all the moving parts, his novels vividly capture lonely Midwestern childhoods and real yearning for connection and understanding.","What’s frustrating is that, characteristically, even this moment of artistic appreciation turns out to have an ulterior motive. Jack’s trauma, it appears, involves both a reproduction of “American Gothic” and … a prairie fire. The reader feels as Elizabeth does upon realizing she’s recreating her toxic dynamic with her father in her marriage. “How elegant,” she thinks. “How perfectly, stupidly, dreadfully elegant.”Andrew Martin is the author of the novel “Early Work” and the story collection “Cool for America.”WELLNESS | By Nathan Hill | 608 pp. | Alfred A.

the Earth,” brilliantly combine the granularity of realism with the timeless, shimmering allure of myth. His new novel, “North Woods,” promises — and delivers — more of the same.","It begins with a pair of young lovers in colonial New England escaping wrathful judgment in their Puritan village. They flee into the wilds of western Massachusetts, chased by “solemn men … with harquebuses cocked in their elbows.” This is Hawthorne given an injection of breathless Edenic bliss: “Mica dusted her heels like silver. Damselflies upon her neck. Flying squirrels in the trees above them, and in the silty sand the great tracks of cats.” The lovers successfully abscond, yet “North Woods” is not about them. It is about the foundation stone they lay at the chapter’s close, and the yellow house that comes to occupy the spot.","The rest of this impossible-to-summarize novel introduces us to inhabitants of that house over the ensuing three-plus centuries. One of them is Charles Osgood, a Revolution-era Loyalist and autodidact whose memoirs, subtitled “Reminiscences of an Apple-Man,” chart his lifelong “pomomania” — an obsession with apples that leads him to farm a luscious variety he christens Osgood’s Wonder.","When Charles dies, the house passes to his spinster daughters, Alice and Mary, whose fractious relationship ends in tragedy. After them, it goes to a motley succession of owners and visitors who include an abolitionist; a landscape painter; a wealthy manufacturer bent on turning the property into a luxury sportsman’s lodge; and his schizophrenic grandson, whose medical travails are chronicled by a World War II-era lobotomist. Later still, we meet an elderly amateur historian who becomes convinced that bodies are buried on the property.","As for the house, it thrives, lapses into disrepair, is abandoned and revived, all the while serving as a not-quite-silent witness to the lives — and deaths — of its occupants. “North Woods” has an affinity with such object-across-time narratives as Annie Proulx’s “Accordion Crimes,” or the 1998 film “The Red Violin,” which followed the many owners of a Stradivarius over four centuries. A third of the way through, Mason unexpectedly introduces ghosts, aligning his abode with fictional haunted houses from Hill House to the Overlook Hotel.","“North Woods” is a hodgepodge narrative, brazenly disjointed in time, perspective and form. Letters, poems and song lyrics, diary entries, medical case notes, real-estate listings, vintage botanical illustrations, pages of an almanac, modern-day nature photographs, a true-crime detective story, an address to a historical society: Mason stuffs all this (and more!) into his bulging scrapbook of a novel. That “North Woods” proves captivating despite its piecemeal structure is testament to Mason’s powers as a writer, his stylish and supple narrative voice.","The novel lives in its oddments, arrayed for us by an author-collector well versed in pre-modern fruit farming, folk medicine and popular songs through the ages. And language. Mason sprinkles early chapters with archaic words (“higgler,” “pippin,” “paradiddles,” “flams”), and his ear for antique idioms is pitch-perfect. Osgood recalls the rowdy crew he assembled to help him clear land, decrying their “drunkenness and villainy” and lamenting that “no iron fist could stay such ruffians forever.” A few chapters (and half a century) later, a traveling Boston gentleman observes, about New England country homes, that “out here, no one tears down — one just adds upon, agglutinates, house to house, shed to shed, like some monstrous German noun.” By the time the 2020s roll around, at novel’s end, we have received an edifying tour of the history of American speechways.","Grandiose plans, vehement loves, crass betrayals and shocking transgressions play out in this house. In one of the most affecting segments, the property falls in the 1830s to a landscape painter, William Henry Teale, whose letters to his friend, a renowned writer, hint at an affection that exceeds the bounds of acceptability, and point toward a crushing regret.","Mason hits notes of comedy as well. When a local medical practitioner ministers to the young Osgood, prescribing the inhaling of rancid sheep milk to cure his apple mania (Mason, himself a trained physician, knows the history of quackery), the boy observes that “it is not mad to think of fruit.” To which his brother responds: “Sniff, man.”Across nearly 400 pages we get involved in each of these lives, then move on; the only abiding players in this drama of ineluctable transformation are Nature and Time. Mason maintains a naturalist’s focus on flora and fauna, on the dissolution of bodies and on biological processes as seasons yield to years and to centuries. In one whimsical passage, the erotic entanglement of a vacationing couple before a cabin fireplace in 1956 is juxtaposed with the “sex romps” of two scolytid beetles, described in hilarious detail — “What perfume! Threo-4-methyl-3-heptanol! Alpha-multistriatin!” Their larvae are lodged in the bark of the firewood that the couple bring with them, carrying a malignant spore that in time will kill all the chestnut trees around the yellow house.","From this profusion Mason draws narrative intricacies I can only nod at here. A Bible belonging to a Black family in Canada, a letter written by an anonymous Native American captive, a box of home movies, old bones surfacing in the mud of spring. Documents, artifacts and stories recur across centuries, creating dramatic ironies and invoking ghosts both metaphorical and literal. How to describe Mason’s sui generis fiction? Think of E.L. Doctorow crossed with Wendell Berry, then graced with a Nabokovian predilection for pattern, puzzle and echo.","The last ghost to haunt these enchanted woods — taking the story into the 21st century and peering forward — is a botanical researcher who notes the insignificance of individual human fates. “Indifference,” she reflects, “is what one might call the great lesson of the world.” And yet, the narrator continues, “she still expects a pause, some kind of recognition or acknowledgment.”The secret of “North Woods,” its blending of the comic and the sublime, lies in the way Mason, deftly toggling between the macro and micro, manages to do both. He not only acknowledges cosmic indifference but celebrates it, even as he pauses to recognize the humans who experience jubilation and heartbreak as they wend their way toward oblivion.","This is fiction that deals in minutes and in centuries, that captures the glory and the triviality of human lives. The forest and the trees: Mason keeps both in clear view in his eccentric and exhilarating novel.","Rand Richards Cooper is the author of two works of fiction and a contributing editor for Commonweal.","NORTH WOODS | By Daniel Mason | Illustrated | 378 pp. | Random House | $28"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/books/review/daniel-mason-north-woods.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/01/books/review/19Mason-review/19Mason-review-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 09:00:19+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:31.093801+00');

'By Dwight Garner', 'entertainment', '["FATHER AND SON: A Memoir, by Jonathan RabanThe problem with being a book critic, Dorothy Parker wrote, is that the work gets in the way of your reading. Jonathan Raban’s posthumous memoir, “Father and Son,” is a book I would have tracked down even if this weren’t my job.","Raban, the British travel writer, novelist and critic, a longtime resident of Seattle, died in January at the age of 80. His death stung because he was the kind of writer we don’t have in quantity. Raban was dry, an articulate amateur, a gentle misanthrope. He was eager to crack euphemism on the snout. He was a man of parts, one who acquired new interests without relinquishing old ones. He was a sailor, and his byline promised crisp winds and flat, salty water ahead. It’s our luck that he left this lively and bittersweet memoir behind.","This is really two books that are stacked, like mozzarella and tomato, in one pile. The first is a sharp memoir about illness and recovery. Raban had a stroke in 2011, at 68, that left him shrunken, lopsided, drooling, unable to walk. He’d been stupid about his health. It wasn’t necessarily that he was a big wine drinker and a lifelong smoker. (Indeed, after his stroke, he smoked an Upmann demitasse cigar on the drive to the emergency room.) It was that he’d left his high blood pressure unmedicated. I find myself furious at him for this. This is surely a displacement of my fury at my own father-in-law, who had a ruinous stroke after the same neglect.","The second book is an account of his parent’s marriage, and of his father’s experience in World War II. Raban’s father was among the British soldiers rescued at Dunkirk, and he saw a good deal of action elsewhere, including the Battle of Anzio. The illness memoir is the better half because it relies on firsthand experience. We find ourselves inside the mind of an outraged, indefatigable commentator on life. The material on his father can’t help seeming distant by comparison, even though it relies on letters and other primary documents. Raban never quite finds the links between father and son that would suggest a continuity of soul between them. Forgive me if I scant the parental and war material in this review.","Raban had been feeling poorly for hours, nearly an entire day, before he allowed his daughter to drive him to the hospital. His balance had been uncertain. His hand had gone to sleep. He’d forgotten to tip at a restaurant. When his doctors chided him for not coming in sooner, because time matters with stroke treatment, he replied: “If I reported to a hospital every time I felt slightly unwell, I’d be a permanent resident there.”Raban’s mental faculties were largely unimpaired by his stroke, though he became worse with numbers. But one side of his body was paralyzed. He would need to learn to walk again, dragging a slow foot along behind him. He would need to learn to manage what caregivers call “transfers” — getting from wheelchair to toilet, or into cars. The stroke “catapulted me,” he writes, “into this new terrain of age and decrepitude.”He felt lucky to be alive, however, and even buoyant. Being hospitalized awakened the travel writer in him. “Strangeness,” he writes, is always “a surefire source of pleasure.” He lived largely inside his head already. If he could still write, read, see friends and drink the occasional bootleg glass of red wine, perhaps all would be, within reason, well. As George Bernard Shaw wrote in 1918 to a playwright friend who’d had a leg amputated, “For a man of your profession two legs are an extravagance.”Raban chafed at the condescension of caregivers, with their baby talk. (“Do you want to go potty now?”) But he revered the good ones. He found himself unaccountably emotional. “Somehow, the stroke seemed to have replenished tear ducts that had lain dry for 60 years like the parched creek beds of a Montana summer suddenly running with water again,” he writes, “and in the next few months I’d find myself starting to blub at the slightest sentimental provocation.”His wit was unimpaired, for sure. He writes: “When you find your eyes misting over at the sight of Judi Dench in some long-outdated episode of ‘As Time Goes By,’ it may be time to call for professional help.” Upset to be asked about his bowel movements, because it seems beside the point, he replies: “OK, then. Mine are always paragons of their kind.”This memoir has a lot to say about the consolations of reading. He finds himself revisiting the work of Tony Judt, the historian and essayist who, like Raban, was a British expatriate. Judt had a crueler fate. He died at 62 from Lou Gehrig’s disease. Raban had once been a committed foe of electronic books, but his stroke changed his mind. Speaking about Judt’s book “Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,” he writes:In print and paper, Judt’s book was just short of a thousand pages — not quite a Gibbonian “Decline and Fall” length, but getting on that way. Hard to read in bed with two hands, let alone one. The near weightlessness of Kindle books endeared them to me now as it never had done before, and “Postwar” in electronic form happened to lay out its paragraphs as if they were independent building blocks, with full double spacing at their tops and bottoms, which drew my attention to how self-contained each stage of Tony Judt’s argument was designed to be.","He critiques stroke memoirs. He disliked Jean-Dominique Bauby’s “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” finding it “implausible on more levels than I could count.” The best, in his view, is Robert McCrum’s “My Year Off,” about which he writes: “There is not a word of woo-woo in it, and its English tone of matter-of-fact irony and ordinary modesty make it the most companionable first-person stroke account that I’ve read.” That description fits Raban’s own book.","The sections about his parents are most alive as a love story. They were newly married when Raban’s father went to war. He was away for three long years. Raban describes how their hopes and desires played out through their correspondence. “It was where they made love; discussed income tax; painted, wallpapered, furnished and planted their new home; chatted about everything from politics to changing nappies; it was where they lived in and for each other.”Reading these letters, Raban writes, “I tremble for the flesh-and-blood couple who will have to live up to the ideal they are setting for themselves in their writing when they eventually meet again in person.” I was moved by this detail: Every night at 10 p.m. while he was away at war, the couple kept a regular “tryst” — they would both think intensely about the other at that moment.","Raban worked on this book for 12 years after his stroke. Every writing day, he asked himself two questions: “What have I lost?” and “Am I fooling myself?” He found both “maddeningly unanswerable,” but the result of his labors makes the responses clear: a) very little, and b) no.","FATHER AND SON: A Memoir | By Jonathan Raban | 323 pp. | Alfred A.

ShewAshley Shew was teaching a class on cyborgs when she became one.","In 2014, when she was in her early 30s, she was diagnosed with bone cancer; she underwent a partial-leg amputation, after which she was fitted with a prosthetic foot and leg. A chemo drug affected her hearing, so she was also prescribed hearing aids. A philosopher of technology who teaches humanities courses to future engineers, doctors and nurses at Virginia Tech, Shew felt as if her new prosthetics had transformed her into a real-life version of the synthetic humans she’d been lecturing on: a self-described “technologized disabled person — a cyborg, a cripborg.”Shew’s new book, “Against Technoableism” — a term she coined — is a kind of introductory seminar on the ways that our hyper-technologized age approaches disability. “When I became an amputee, people kept reassuring me (actually, reassuring themselves) that with advanced and wonderful prosthetic technologies, I would be back even better than ever,” Shew writes, “superhuman, enhanced, a 10-million-dollar bionic woman.” She finds one of the clearest expressions of this titular attitude in the words of Hugh Herr, a double amputee who designs (and uses) futuristic bionic limbs at the M.I.T. Media Lab. “I don’t see disability,” Herr has said. “I see bad technology.”Shew acknowledges the transformative role that tech plays in her life; in her author photo, she affectionately cradles her unattached prosthetic like a ukulele. But in this series of short, wonderfully lucid essays, she argues that technoableism — the popular depiction of tech as a wholesale cure for disability — does real damage by positioning the disabled body as fundamentally broken. The goal of existing technologies is too often rehabilitation into the mainstream — the amputee ought to walk “normally,” the deaf person speak, the autistic person have “quiet hands” — and it’s up to engineering to get them there. Within this framework, any possibility of a joyful disabled life, lived without the need for improvement, is unimaginable.","Shew eventually affixed googly eyes to the toes on her prosthetic foot so that it could “stare back” at her, and she employs this same playfully confrontational style in her writing. This style also reflects the crossroads at which disability discourse now finds itself: at once a movement steeped in the vernacular of the extremely online; an emerging field of scholarship with its own academic vocabulary; a civil-rights call for sweeping policy change; and a marginalized identity on par with race or gender. As a result, a lot of disability writing today (Alice Wong’s “Year of the Tiger”; Elsa Sjunneson’s “Being Seen”) blends structural analysis, internet-chatty cultural criticism, scathing social-justice indictment and confessional narratives of medical trauma. “Against Technoableism” is an important addition to the genre.","Shew’s stand-alone chapters can be read in any order, reflecting what she calls the book’s “crip aesthetics”: “Why should people be forced to move linearly through the text?” I wondered if the book’s forceful reminders of its central arguments throughout might be another aspect of this “aesthetic” — useful repetitions for someone reading through the distractions of A.D.H.D., the fog of a chronic illness or poor eyesight. As is the case so often with both technology and disability, what at first presents itself as a flaw may ultimately be a feature, not a bug.","Andrew Leland is the author of “The Country of the Blind: A Memoir at the End of Sight.”AGAINST TECHNOABLEISM: Rethinking Who Needs Improvement | By Ashley Shew | 148 pp. | W.W.

Vauhini Vara', 'entertainment', '["I graduated from high school in 2000, the year Jhumpa Lahiri won a Pulitzer Prize for her first book, “Interpreter of Maladies,” a collection of stories about well-off Indian immigrants and their children. I loved it. It was the first time I’d read fiction that bore some resemblance to my own privileged, suburban, Indian American life.","It couldn’t have been a coincidence that, for a college creative-writing class a couple of years later, the first piece of fiction I turned in was about an Indian American girl visiting Hyderabad for her cousin’s wedding. In the span of seven single-spaced pages, the story mentioned arranged marriage, saris, rickshaws and chai. Surely, I thought, this was what I, as an Indian American writer, was supposed to be writing about — Lahiri was the only model I had.","Then I started to read more widely: George Saunders, Joy Williams, Lorrie Moore, Denis Johnson. These authors wrote weird, darkly funny stories that resonated with me. Lahiri, with her restrained chronicles of the Bengali Brahmin bourgeoisie, started to seem limited by contrast. While some of her depiction of Indian American life reflected my experience, I was becoming more aware of what didn’t.","That wasn’t my only reservation. I noticed that critics and friends seemed to judge Saunders, Williams, Moore and Johnson for their prose alone, while knowing little, if anything, about their backgrounds. With Lahiri, her ethnicity seemed always at the forefront. On NPR, an interviewer described a sad Indian woman in one of her stories, then asked Lahiri, “Is that your mom?” Everything I read about her seemed to be about her background — the Indianness of it all — rather than her writing.","I stopped imitating Lahiri and started imitating others. In graduate school, I brought to one of my first creative-writing classes a story about a pair of teenage best friends that ended with the girls running down the street shouting “Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!” The professor found this ending extraordinary, until other students pointed out — with incredible gentleness, under the circumstances — that they’d read almost those exact lines in a well-known story by Moore.","There was another thing I ripped off from Moore and other writers I admired: their whiteness. In one of my stories, a pair of sisters (white) visit their aging grandmother (white) at her house on a lake, after the death of their mother (white). In another, a C.E.O. (white) goes missing, and a bunch of his employees (white, mostly) go searching for him.","My limited reading experience had given me the impression that stories about people of color had to be about being a person of color. I still wasn’t well-read, and in the work I knew by writers of color, questions of identity were central. This was true not just of Lahiri’s stories, but also of the most popular ones by other writers of color: Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz, ZZ Packer, Amy Tan.","One day, my friend Jenny Zhang, who would later publish the acclaimed story collection “Sour Heart,” asked me why I didn’t write more about characters who were Indian American, like me. I explained that it was because I didn’t want to have to populate my fiction with arranged marriages, saris, rickshaws and chai. But, Jenny asked reasonably, what made me believe that I would have to do that?I’m not the only writer of my generation who has bristled at Lahiri’s version of Indian American experience. In 2021, the novelist Sanjena Sathian, writing in The Drift, criticized what she called Lahiri’s “aesthetics of respectability,” in which Indian American characters behave as model minorities, while offering “PBS-quality cultural instruction” to white people — as when, in one story, a (white) woman mistakes “Bengali” for a religion and is gently corrected by her forgiving (Indian) boyfriend.","Yet lately it has occurred to me that Lahiri came of age in circumstances very different from mine or Sathian’s. Lahiri’s family moved to Rhode Island in 1970, when there were 51,000 Indian immigrants in the United States — and far fewer than that in Rhode Island. In an essay Lahiri later wrote about the state, she said that her family “didn’t fundamentally belong” there, recounting that her mother once received nine pieces of racist hate mail while working at the elementary school Lahiri had attended. Responding with forbearance to American ignorance about Indians — as Lahiri’s characters tend to — might have been a matter of social survival for the Indian Americans in her life.","I was born in 1982, in a small city in Saskatchewan, Canada, but by the time I started high school, my family had moved to the Seattle suburbs. We arrived in 1995, before Seattle’s tech boom had gotten underway — Jeff Bezos had just founded Amazon out of his home garage near the Bellevue Square Mall where my sister and I shopped. But the presence of Microsoft nearby meant that there was already a fast-growing Indian community. One uncle had been the first Indian employee at Microsoft; another would play a major role in building Amazon’s Kindle; an acquaintance of friends of my parents, Satya Nadella, would become Microsoft’s C.E.O.","Being Indian American was neither the most important fact of my life nor a particular source of tension. My parents switched back and forth between Telugu and English and didn’t mind that my sister and I answered in English. Some of my closest friends had Chinese, Taiwanese and Panamanian roots. At their houses, hearing languages other than English wasn’t unusual.","By the 2000 census — the year Lahiri won her Pulitzer — the number of Indian immigrants in the United States had increased 20-fold since 1970. That those around me didn’t define me solely on the basis of my ethnicity doubtless made it easier for me to define myself on my own terms. Lahiri was describing the world in which she’d grown up, not the one in which I had.","In my mid-20s, after that conversation with Jenny, I decided to write about Indian Americans again. I began a novel, “The Immortal King Rao,” whose titular character, a future tech C.E.O., is an immigrant to the United States from the region of India where my family comes from — not Lahiri’s upper-crust northern milieu but the agricultural south, where my mother was raised by a veterinarian father and my father in a family of coconut farmers. I also started writing the stories that appear in my new collection, “This Is Salvaged,” featuring Indian Americans in multicultural communities. One character is an alcoholic, another an aspiring phone-sex operator; none are model minorities.","It took me more than a decade to finish both books. In the meantime, people from the Indian diaspora were becoming much more visible in American culture: the actors Mindy Kaling and Aziz Ansari, the musicians Charli XCX and Norah Jones, and the politicians Nikki Haley and Pramila Jayapal. At the same time, books were proliferating in which life in the Indian diaspora was part of the landscape without being the principal subject, including Abraham Verghese’s “Cutting for Stone” (2009), Tania James’s “Aerogrammes” (2012) and Akhil Sharma’s “Family Life” (2014).","By the time Sathian wrote about Lahirism, Indian American literature was already moving beyond it. Sathian herself published a novel that year called “Gold Diggers” — a literary sendup of the model minority myth involving a potion made of stolen gold — which was optioned by Kaling for TV.","Even Lahiri seemed to have tired of Lahirism. In 2012, she moved to Rome and began writing in Italian, including “In Other Words\" (2016), an essay collection in which she noted that she’d started creating characters “without a particular cultural identity.” Her most recent novel, “Whereabouts” (2021), also written in Italian, is a loose, meandering first-person narrative with a protagonist whose identity is so abstract that she isn’t even given a name.","Since then, the diversity of Indian American fiction has only continued to grow. In Sarah Thankam Mathews’s “All This Could Be Different” (2022), about a woman’s post-college life in Milwaukee, her narrator’s Indian American identity figures prominently, but so does her identity as someone who dates women, who lives in the Midwest and who is generally baffled by adulthood. Here’s a line from a sex scene in the novel: “I did not stop rubbing her clit, which had swollen like a raisin in payasam.” What is payasam, and how might a raisin swell in it? If you know, you know; if you don’t, there’s Google.","The other night, I opened my copy of The New Yorker and found a story by Lahiri from her new collection, “Roman Stories,” which comes out in October. The narrator is an unnamed Italian man considering an affair with a foreign, also unnamed, stranger. I admired a lot about it. It was also nothing like my writing, or Sathian’s or Mathews’s. I slept well that night and, in the morning, went back to my desk to write.","Vauhini Vara’s novel “The Immortal King Rao” was a finalist for the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Her new book, “This Is Salvaged,” a collection of stories, is out this month."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/books/review/jhumpa-lahiri-and-me.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/24/books/review/24Vara/24Vara-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-18 09:00:32+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:31.879923+00');

I want to get this out of the way because in general I have such tremendous admiration for the man: that debonair eminence of ye olde New Journalism who is both a living landmark of Manhattan and his own best character.","It’s a writerly tic, the retro habit of referring to women by the color of their hair, but as noun rather than adjective. “A slender and attractive brunette.” “A slender and stylish honey blonde in a ponytail.” “A gregarious young brunette.” “A perky and heavily perfumed brunette in a red cocktail dress.”At least silver foxes, of which the natty Talese, 91, is a prime example, get the courtesy of being compared to a clever animal.","If occasionally feeling as if you’re trapped in a Peter Arno cartoon is the price of admission to a new work by Talese, sign me up. But only one chunk of his latest book, “Bartleby and Me,” from which the above quotations are drawn, can fairly be called new. That is Part 3, the story of Nicholas Bartha, the Romanian émigré and doctor who blew up his multimillion-dollar Upper East Side townhouse in 2006, killing himself in the process, rather than sell it and let his ex-wife have the proceeds, as a judge had ordered.","What happened after the resultant 900,000 pounds of debris were cleared away involves “a glamorous 40-year-old Russian-born blonde named Janna Bullock,” the real-estate developer and fixture of Page Six whom Talese, also an Upper East Sider, refers to, more originally, as “the contessa of flippers.” It’s a plot for the ages, and right in his own backyard.","Named in homage to the classic short story by Herman Melville, “Bartleby and Me” alludes both to Talese’s own status as a self-described “old scrivener” and to the humbler figures that have most captured his interest over a long career: doormen, chauffeurs, cooks, clerks, cleaners, cops, alley cats, the last marcher in a parade. (This is a writer who seems to assemble biographical files even for pieces of limestone.) Jack Vergara — a veteran waiter at the neighboring Links Club who noticed the smell of gas emanating from the doomed townhouse, called Con Ed, and insisted only a cold breakfast be served to club members that morning — is the kind of indelible “subsidiary character” in which Talese specializes.","Indeed, Talese’s relative indifference to celebrity is what ensured his own. Long before “quiet quitting” there was Bartleby’s phrase “I would prefer not to,” and that’s the essence of what Talese first replied to Harold Hayes, the editor of then-mighty Esquire, when asked to write the profile that would become perhaps the most venerated in magazine history, “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold” (1966). The article would inspire countless lesser talents to circle whatever famous subject they couldn’t corner for 40 minutes over a Cobb salad and contort the result into a florid narrative for the glossies.","Part 2 of “Bartleby and Me” is the story behind the Sinatra story, and even the story behind the story behind the Sinatra story: a chart of Talese’s notes published in the same issue, wherein the author cusses out and expresses his mistrust of Hayes.","Revealed are a few tools and tricks of the Talesian trade, among them the 7-by-3 cardboard squares, salvaged from his laundered dress shirts, that he uses for notetaking, sometimes from the privacy of a bathroom stall. (Talese’s habit of neglecting to use a tape recorder, along with special interests that could be called prurient — massage parlors and motel voyeurism among them — has led some journalism watchdogs to bark.) Another, more compelling tic: his familiar method of linking disparate individuals in a sort of baton-passing from chapter to chapter.","Part 1 is about Talese’s tenure at The New York Times, where a more seasoned reporter once advised him, “Young man, never interview anyone over the phone if you can help it.” (Compared with email, text and Gchat, of course, the phone now seems like a holy relic.)Renowned for his epic book about this newspaper and its leaders, “The Kingdom and the Power” (1969), an ur-text of media studies, Talese here pans over its underlings and undersung — the linotype operators and printers, a substantial number of them “deaf mutes,” who would repair for drinks to Gough’s Chop House in actually ink-stained four-corner hats; and copyreaders, those “private, pensive and pondering individuals.” He zeros in on one of them, Alden Whitman, who became a chief obituary writer (he called himself the “happy oarsman on the Styx”), whom Talese also profiled for Esquire, with considerably more access than Sinatra gave. The piece got Whitman a seat next to Johnny Carson on “The Tonight Show.” These were different times.","Talese has tried, and by many lights failed, at straightforward memoir before, namely the 2006 rambler “A Writer’s Life.” “Bartleby and Me” is more of an ambler, in which he appears to give his finger to the form by filigreeing a couple of his ironclad hits and then tacking on a new gargoyle of a tale. He’s done it his way, and one can imagine him and Sinatra’s ghost sharing a song-and-dance number, a couple of satisfied sailors on the town.","BARTLEBY AND ME: Reflections of an Old Scrivener | By Gay Talese | 320 pp. | Mariner Books | $28.99"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/17/books/bartleby-and-me-review-gay-talese.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/multimedia/17Talese-review-zchv/17Talese-review-zchv-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-17 15:00:20+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:32.18377+00');

'By Jason Farago', 'entertainment', '["Some authors you love for their fire; some you love for their ice. J.M. Coetzee, the South African-turned-Australian novelist, has spent half a century engaged with the biggest questions of human reason and human dignity, but his novels are not what you’d call grand. They’re sleek, unadorned, unfailingly precise; most top out at 200 pages or so; the sentences have been knapped to their sharpest. Stylistically, his novels are quite brisk. Morally, they are heavyweights.","Coetzee was born in Cape Town in 1940, into a family of what he has called “recusant Afrikaners”: They spoke English rather than Afrikaans at home. By the 1980s his spare, stinging prose had won international acclaim as one of literature’s strongest responses to apartheid, though more militant South African writers were dubious of his ambiguity and discretion. He’s now won every literary gong available (a Nobel in 2003, two Bookers before that), and has as good a claim as anyone to be the most significant living author in English — a language about which he has lately grown ambivalent.","If you’re new to Coetzee, we’d better start with the most obvious matter: It’s pronounced kuut-SAY, two syllables, rhyming with “day,” not with “idea.” The J stands for John, and the M — well, we now know it stands for Maxwell, but for decades he let people believe it was Michael. That accidental alias is the first of many personal and literary feints, and he has always leavened the seriousness of his prose with metafictional evasions.","His 15 novels (along with three volumes of autobiography that might as well be fiction, plus essays on censorship, race, linguistics and psychology) include head-on realist fictions of South Africa during apartheid and after. But there are also Coetzeean stand-ins both male and female, characters who migrate from one plane of existence to another, and more shattered fourth walls than on HGTV’s “Flip or Flop.” The books written since his move to Australia in 2002, especially, have the schematic beauty of Heinrich von Kleist’s marionette theater. (This abstraction is one reason that the movie versions of Coetzee’s novels are universally terrible — the “Disgrace” with John Malkovich truly lives up to its title — while more oblique adaptations, such as operas of “Waiting for the Barbarians” and “Slow Man,” have fared better.)I’m sure it says something about me that my favorite novelist is known for works of unrelieved seriousness, psychological extremity and reliably joyless sex. He’s the very last writer you should go to for lush description or richly drawn landscape. (Here is an example of scene-setting in “The Pole,” his new novella: “It is a pleasant autumn day. The leaves are turning, et cetera.”)But Coetzee is no misanthrope and no Gloomy Gus: a reputation that may come more from his aversion to interviews and prizes than his fiction anyway. As with his early hero Samuel Beckett, there’s an essential truth — even, believe me, an optimism — in the muscles of Coetzee’s fat-free prose. (Also like Beckett, Coetzee has a dark humor that’s very underrated; when you are buried to your neck in sand, you gotta laugh.) Here’s where to start.","After two early novels with some showy, youthful acrobatics (twinned narratives, numbered paragraphs), Coetzee published the intense, dislocated “Waiting for the Barbarians” (1980). From its first line — “I have never seen anything like it: two little discs of glass suspended in front of his eyes in loops of wire” — we are plunged into a third-tier dusty frontier town of some authoritarian empire, so far from the capital that even sunglasses are a novelty. The local magistrate has been a dutiful, if concupiscent, colonial administrator. But the fanatical Colonel Joll (he with the sunglasses) becomes obsessed with heading off a supposed barbarian invasion. His campaign of terror forces the magistrate into a moral dilemma that will cost him much more than his job.","This book is lean and mean; as regards dystopian brutality, it makes “The Handmaid’s Tale” look like “Little Women.” But Coetzee’s paranoid and segregated empire is not an allegory for apartheid South Africa — indeed, that was what irritated his South African critics most. Yes, the true “barbarians” are the empire’s men, but there’s a larger and more troubling universality to Coetzee’s torturers, and to our own desires to read about them. “The dark, forbidden chamber,” Coetzee wrote in a 1986 essay for this publication, “is the origin of novelistic fantasy per se.”You should read “Life & Times of Michael K” (1983), the rangy parable of dignity and diminishment for which he won the first of his two Bookers. Michael K is a gardener in Cape Town whose mother is a housekeeper in ill health. They try to leave the city for the Swartberg Mountains, but she does not survive the journey, and K falls into a bad dream of bureaucracies and brutality. Unlike in “Waiting for the Barbarians,” here we are in contemporary South Africa — except this South Africa has fallen into civil war, where whites-only suburbs have been ransacked and the apartheid-state flag flies over detention camps. (K’s race is never specified outright, though the context makes clear he is of mixed white, Black and Asian heritage.)This was 1983. Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu were still in prison; international boycotts were successfully targeting South African athletes and artists; the apartheid state was fighting not only its Black majority, but guerrillas in Namibia and Angola. A civil war was hardly unthinkable, and the one Coetzee imagined was as stupid as it was violent, running on well after the oppressors had lost the will to fight. (Even more than the imperialists in “Waiting for the Barbarians,” the whites in “Michael K” know they are doomed.)Slow-witted but unwilling to yield, K abandons society and lives, barely, off the land — shriveling into a size-zero Crusoe who must embrace insignificance as the price of being free. It is a strange exaltation of freedom, this small life of K’s. And yet in reducing one man to the pith of animal existence, Coetzee wrote one of the few books I know that merits the most clichéd of all praise: life-affirming.","Breathless, bedraggled, her petticoat heavy with saltwater, the castaway Susan Barton washes ashore on an island off the coast of Brazil, but two men are already there: the Englishman Robinson Cruso (no E), and his man Friday (no tongue). The trio are rescued. On the voyage home Cruso dies. Marooned in London, Susan has nothing but “all that Cruso leaves behind, which is the story of his island.” She tries without success to write, while Friday — Cruso said slave-traders had mutilated him; Susan has her doubts — seems to have no language at all. They must turn to a morally dubious and deeply indebted ghostwriter: one Daniel Foe, whose views on literature and the market for true stories will cleave her forever from Cruso’s isle.","I am ever and always in love with “Foe” (1986), which, from a bare plot summary, may sound like one of many the-empire-writes-back sequels of the English canon — Jean Rhys’s “Wide Sargasso Sea” (an Antillean “Jane Eyre”), Peter Carey’s “Jack Maggs” (an Antipodean “Great Expectations”). Two generations of comp-lit students have gorged now on the novel’s irresolvable tangle of speech and writing, gender and colonialism, and wrung every drop of theory from its fewer than 160 pages. But “Foe,” written in an extraordinary ventriloquism of 18th-century English, is so much more than a postcolonial just-so story, and much more, too, than a reverse Robinsonade.","Who is an author, and who has a “life story”? From its three-letter title on, Coetzee’s shortest and greatest novel is about how art and life will always be at odds. It’s about the irresistible seductions of bankrupt writers, and literature’s insufficient promise to show you another world. And above all, this inexhaustible novel is about how to hold onto your true self when new media — the novel in the 18th century, the TikTok account in the 21st — want to warp your life into a narrative for sale.","Coetzee has written three volumes of autobiography — but no less than the novels, these ostensible memoirs (all narrated in the third person, a “he” held at arm’s length) have a shifty relationship with the truth. “Boyhood” (1997) relates the author’s life from ages 10 to 13, with unhappy days at school and a deep alienation from his father relieved through rapturous trips to the Karoo, the Western Cape’s arid farm country. “Youth” (2002) follows a 20ish Coetzee to London, where he strikes out with the ladies.","The last, best, and strangest of the three is “Summertime” (2009), which ostensibly covers the 1970s, his return to South Africa and his initial efforts at fiction. But it seems the author named on the cover is already dead; the book comprises five interviews with former lovers, students and acquaintances, conducted by a biographer of “the late John Coetzee.”For the 50-something professor David Lurie, a mastery of English Romantic poetry seems to offer an ethical exemption for seducing one of his students, whose degree of consent we could generously call ambiguous. The affair is exposed; Lurie loses his job (after a terrifically drawn scene of a university tribunal, with all the dark comedy of Kafka); he leaves Cape Town to join his daughter, Lucy, on her farm in the Eastern Cape. But then comes another act of sexual violence, far more brutal than his own transgression — and as Lucy considers her well-being, her father must cleanse the gangrenous foundation of his moral life.","Unlike his equivocal 1980s fictions, “Disgrace” (1999) demanded to be read in light of contemporary South Africa: a new multiracial democracy, engrossed in the public hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. When David begs his daughter to go to the police, Lucy insists she must not report her gang rape “in this place, at this time … this place being South Africa.” I can’t lie, this book is bleak — but so is “Oedipus Rex.” There can be a beauty in bleakness, and the austere fatalism of “Disgrace” has made it one of the most debated novels of the last 30 years.","It netted Coetzee Booker No. 2 (as with the first time, he did not bother to pick it up) and a public renown he manifestly disliked. It also elicited angry opposition in South Africa: from the top of the African National Congress, who decried its “racism” to the U.N., and from white conservatives who thought they were the real victims. Today, though, its more immediate value may lie in its scrutiny of gender: “Disgrace” is, of course, a proto-MeToo novel, all about the desires and deficiencies of men, and the public and private cancellations they may bring upon themselves.","“Disgrace” also inaugurates a major theme of Coetzee’s later writing: the relationship of humans to animals, examined with a philosopher’s rigor in “Elizabeth Costello” and in his short fiction. If Lurie finds even the slightest absolution — or grace, the title’s not-quite-opposite — it is in a veterinary clinic, caring for animals in a world where men are dogs.","In his novels Coetzee evades, contorts, ironizes; in his nonfiction, he has the exactitude of the surgeon. “White Writing: On the Culture of Letters in South Africa” (1988), the most original of his several collections of essays, studies the novels of “people no longer European, not yet African,” and the national and racial mythmaking of white novelists working in both English and Afrikaans. (The bulk of the novels he studies, by authors such as Sarah Gertrude Millin and C.M. van den Heever, were written before the institution of apartheid in 1948.)There are syrupy miscegenation tragedies, there is repellent crypto-anthropology about the lazy natives and the industrious Dutch, yet Coetzee’s key object of study is the plaasroman, or “farm novel” in Afrikaans. In these settlers’ pastoral tales, the South African soil is mythologized and feminized, but it’s a harsh and “infertile” Earth Mother that seems to reject even the dead. I value “White Writing,” especially, as a model for how a critic should engage with racist works from the past: no dismissal, no excuses either, just a calm and unflinching exposure of their fatal contradictions. “Our craft,” as Coetzee writes here, “is all in reading the other: gaps, inverses, undersides; the veiled, the dark, the buried, the feminine; alterities.”Coetzee has had a fascinating third act since immigrating to Australia in the 2000s; his books have grown more experimental and philosophical, blending fiction with nonfiction and often defying traditional novelistic structure. The most important of his Australian novels — a book of real power and deep mystery — is “The Childhood of Jesus” (2013), the first in a trilogy of peculiar and deadpan stories about a boy and a man making new lives in a world “washed clean.”Like everyone in Novilla, the featureless town they have arrived at by boat, Simón and David are refugees whose memory has been erased, mastering the rudiments of a new language. (That language is Spanish — and recently, as a little personal protest against the hegemony of English, Coetzee has been releasing his novels in Spanish more than a year before they come out in the original.) Simón introduces the boy to a woman, Inés, and in an outlandish parody of the Annunciation convinces her that she is David’s mother. But David’s behavior … well, it’s not quite divine. He’s an entitled brat with a serious hangup about mathematics, propounding a mystical belief that numbers are “islands in a great black sea of nothingness,” beyond the reach of arithmetic.","This book, and the two that follow it, are quixotic, in the original sense: “Don Quixote,” or at least a children’s adaptation of it, figures centrally in David’s personal gospel. Even more than “Waiting for the Barbarians,” this one snaps all allegorical readings before you can say Noli me tangere. Yet “The Childhood of Jesus” brings home so many of the themes that have animated Coetzee since 1970: above all, the tension between emotion and reason. There is an ardor that can lie behind even the greatest austerity."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/article/jm-coetzee-best-books.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/15/books/review/00Essential-COETZEE/00Essential-COETZEE-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-19 18:30:18+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:32.496581+00');

Harris', 'entertainment', '["A group of prominent novelists, including John Grisham, Jonathan Franzen and Elin Hilderbrand, are joining the legal battle against OpenAI over its chatbot technology, as fears about the encroachment of artificial intelligence on creative industries continue to grow.","More than a dozen authors filed a lawsuit against OpenAI on Tuesday, accusing the company, which has been backed with billions of dollars in investment from Microsoft, of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train its popular ChatGPT chatbot. The complaint, which was filed along with the Authors Guild, said that OpenAI’s chatbots can now produce “derivative works” that can mimic and summarize the authors’ books, potentially harming the market for authors’ work, and that the writers were neither compensated nor notified by the company.","“The success and profitability of OpenAI are predicated on mass copyright infringement without a word of permission from or a nickel of compensation to copyright owners,” the complaint said. The complaint, which was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, said that while OpenAI does not publicly declare which works it uses to train its models, the company has admitted to using copyrighted material. The complaint also said that OpenAI’s ChatGPT is capable of producing summaries of books that include details not available in reviews or elsewhere online, which suggests the underlying program was fed the books in their entirety.","The Authors Guild lawsuit is the latest in a series brought by writers against OpenAI. It is likely to generate attention because of its high-profile plaintiffs, who include best-selling novelists from a range of genres, among them David Baldacci, Jodi Picoult, George R.R. Martin, George Saunders and Michael Connelly.","Douglas Preston, a novelist who joined the lawsuit, said he was shocked when he asked ChatGPT to describe minor characters in his books and it spat back detailed information that wasn’t available in reviews or Wikipedia entries for the novels.","“That’s when I looked at this and said, ‘My God, ChatGPT has read my books, how many of my books has it read?’” he said. “It knew everything, and that’s when I got a bad feeling.”A representative for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November, authors, publishers and retailers have been trying to rein in the rampant and increasingly disruptive incursion of A.I. in the industry. Already, there has been a rise in A.I.-generated books on Amazon, including travel guides and books on plant and fungi foraging, which prompted the New York Mycological Society to issue a warning to avoid A.I.-generated guides.","Amazon has taken steps to monitor and curb the influx of A.I.-generated books. This month, it posted new guidelines for self-published authors, requiring them to disclose whether they had used A.I. to create texts. It also limited the number of titles users can upload to its self-publishing platform each day, to three. Amazon does not currently disclose which books are created by A.I. to its customers, but it may do so in the future, according to an Amazon representative.","A handful of other lawsuits have been filed in recent months by writers against OpenAI and Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram. This month, Michael Chabon, Ayelet Waldman and Matthew Klam were among a group of writers who collectively sued OpenAI and Meta, which has also developed A.I. technology, for copyright infringement.","In a filing last month for another suit brought by authors, lawyers for OpenAI moved to dismiss the bulk of plaintiffs’ claims, and argued that using texts “for innovations,” including training A.I., constitutes fair use.","Copyright questions surrounding A.I. remain unresolved, and experts are divided over whether authors’ claims of infringement will hold up in court. Some argue that if an A.I. program is ingesting copyrighted works for training but creates new works that are substantially different, that constitutes fair use. Others, however, believe the authors’ argument is likely to prevail.","“They’ve scraped all this content and put it into their databases without asking permission — that seems like a huge grab of content,” said Edward Klaris, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property and media law. “I think courts are going to say that copying into the database is an infringement in itself.”Mary Bly, who publishes historical romance novels under the name Eloisa James, said she joined the Authors Guild suit because she worried that if writers failed to draw boundaries around their work, technology companies would continue to plunder and imitate them.","“This lawsuit is important because it establishes a line in the sand,” she said. “If you’re going to train things in the future on my books, you need to license them. You can’t just take things.”"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/books/authors-openai-lawsuit-chatgpt-copyright.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/19/books/19AIlawsuit-1/19AIlawsuit-1-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 12:51:16.588+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:33.053771+00');

-0.05054336413741112]', 'By A.O. Scott', 'entertainment', '["THE FALL: The End of Fox News and the Murdoch Dynasty, by Michael WolffMichael Wolff’s new book is a chronicle of very recent events that starts with something that hasn’t happened yet: the death of Rupert Murdoch, who as of this writing is 92 and very much alive. A prologue in the form of a deadpan mock obituary — by far the most sober and judicious stretch of pages in this cornucopia of innuendo and convoluted prose — sets up a headlong tumble through 18 months of uncertainty and upheaval at Fox News and among its custodians in the Murdoch family. A story of chaotic corporate stewardship and generational conflict unfolds in the shadow of a looming actuarial certainty.","Wolff knows what you might be thinking: “Yes, yes,” he acknowledges, “here is quite a bit of the raw inspiration for ‘Succession,’ that roman à clef soap opera about you-know-who and his family and their empire.” But despite the obvious parallels between the Roys and the Murdochs, Wolff offers “The Fall” as “a TV newsroom sitcom” rather than a family tragedy. A gritty reboot of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” you might say.","In Wolff’s view, playing the saga for laughs is a risky choice: “To treat the Fox phenomenon and the Murdoch family as a cultural confection ripe for comedy,” he writes, “may be dangerously close to liberal sacrilege.”Maybe. You could also argue that laughing at Fox News — and at Donald J. Trump, the subject of Wolff’s recent best-selling trilogy and a major offstage character in “The Fall” — has been a cherished liberal pastime for years. Not that Wolff, who likes to play peekaboo with his own ideological leanings, has anything but contempt for a media mainstream (The Times very much included) that he sees as imprisoned by soggy left-leaning sentiments.","In any case, it’s not that he thinks Fox (or Trump) is a joke, but rather that his professed ability to suspend political judgment allows him to be amused by the inner workings of power rather than appalled by its outer manifestations.","He is less interested in the “public position” of Fox News than in its “private life”; or, as he puts it elsewhere, “what is in its heart, or churning in its stomach.” This psychoanatomical method — picking brains and poking at entrails — is more or less how he approached the Trump administration in “Fire and Fury” (2018), “Siege” (2019) and “Landslide” (2021). Like Trumpland, Murdoch World presents him with a sprawling, raucous spectacle, equal parts farce, melodrama and gangland potboiler.","“The Fall” updates “The Man Who Owns the News,” Wolff’s 2008 portrait of Murdoch, and refracts the public record through a lens of gossip, backbiting and trash talk. He rarely quotes a named source (Roger Ailes, who died in 2017 and whom Wolff recalls fondly in a prologue, is a notable exception) — a defensible practice, perhaps, when dealing with so many backstabbers and underminers.","But he doesn’t rely on clearly individuated anonymous sources either. Instead, assertions of fact and judgments of character emerge through a hazy collective consciousness. Lachlan Murdoch is a “chucklehead”; his brother James is a “hothead”; Laura Ingraham is a “drunk”; Sean Hannity is “a moron.” Who says so? In the last case, it’s Ailes, but otherwise it’s impossible to tell. “Family and friends.” “Close Murdoch retainers.” When Kimberly Guilfoyle settles into a private plane on the way to Ailes’s funeral, Wolff writes: “What was also clear, if you wanted it to be, was that she was wearing no underwear.” In this case the source seems to be the reader’s own dirty mind.","If you’ve been following the news, you know the story told in “The Fall,” and you know how it ends. What suspense there is arises from questions that start out trivial and end up moot. How much will Fox pay to settle a lawsuit brought by Dominion, one of the voting-machine companies at the center of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election? What Fox star will be fired? In case you’ve already forgotten, the answers are $787.5 million and Tucker Carlson.","As we wait for those shoes to drop, Murdoch’s fourth marriage, to the former model Jerry Hall, is coming to an end, and his relationships with the children from his second marriage — James, Lachlan and Elisabeth — are in a state of perpetual churn. There isn’t quite enough drama to be wrung out of the month-by-month narrative of a year and a half, so Wolff rehashes earlier episodes of palace intrigue and family dysfunction and offers a pocket history of Fox in the Trump era.","Apart from the ascendance of Trump himself, those years saw the ouster of Roger Ailes and the sale of Murdoch’s movie and non-news television holdings to Disney. In Wolff’s telling, Ailes, who had run Fox as a toxic, highly profitable personal fief within Murdoch’s empire, was brought down not by the women he had harassed and demeaned, but by Rupert’s sons, who, along with their other siblings, each pocketed $2 billion in the Disney deal.","The source of their vendetta was the dissonance between their genteel liberal values and Fox’s bellicose conservatism. James, portrayed here as a blustering idealist, is quoted as wanting to make the channel “a force for good.” Wolff treats this sentiment almost like a punchline, as evidence that the Murdoch children are “comically at odds with the Fox brand.”That’s true of Rupert, too, whose politics Wolff characterizes as Reagan-Thatcherite boilerplate: “generally anti-left, pro-business, suit-and-tie stuff.” Under Ailes, Fox News turned into something else, a volcano of cultural paranoia and racial resentment often euphemized as populist. Wolff’s pages on Carlson, while often insightful, tend to skate over how heavily Carlson’s appeal leans on overt white supremacist language. But he isn’t wrong in noting that, by firing Carlson in the wake of the Dominion settlement, Fox “effectively accepted the liberal case against itself.”Throughout these pages, Murdoch is quoted heaping scorn on Trump (“an idiot,” a “fool,” “plainly nuts”); the real subject of “The Fall” is the schism between the former president and the network that had served as his de facto propaganda arm. “Who was bigger? The Fox monopoly backed by the will (and money) of the most powerful man in the history of media, or the former president and television personality who had become the most famous man on the planet?”This isn’t just a two-man contest. One of Wolff’s motifs is the mutual contempt between Ailes and the Murdochs. He regarded them as “snobs” and not “real Americans.” They — including Rupert — increasingly regarded the network as an embarrassment, albeit a profitable one. “The money continued to roll in — and Fox continued to poison every aspect of the Murdoch family’s presence in the world.”In turning against Trump, Murdoch was also pushing back against Fox itself. “With Murdoch committed to the no-more-Trump cause,” Wolff writes, “it seemed here was a real test about who was stronger: owner or newsroom.”“Or, really, owner or audience.”Like Rupert Murdoch’s death, the 2024 presidential election hasn’t happened yet. Neither have any of the Trump trials that may precede it. Without predicting how all that will go — why scoop himself? — Wolff bets against Fox, and backs up the wager with some convincing media analysis. Cable news is a shrinking platform with an aging audience, and Murdoch, the last of the old-school press barons, isn’t known for his mastery of digital media. As Wolff observes, “the Fox world, the Fox power, the Fox effect, the Fox heavy foot on 21st-century America had come because of its conservative mind-share monopoly” — a dominance challenged by “a younger, techy right-wing world.”The fall of Fox News — or at least the end of its hegemony — may thus be inevitable, even without the Murdoch drama. The dirt-dishing and tea-spilling makes for queasy fun, and the clash of big personalities is diverting, but compared to the gaudy circus of Trumpworld, this show feels a little tame.

'By Sam Sifton', 'food', '["Good morning. I roasted a pig in a box, as I realize I’ve been doing for close to 20 years. I had a perfect Coke float with vanilla ice cream, in a tall paper cup with a long spoon and a wide straw. I cooked without recipes — elegant salads built on rounds of late-summer tomatoes, chopped cheese quesadillas, Boston mackerel crudo — and I read a ton of books. There was fishing most days, adventures in the woods, plenty of naps. The rough-winged swallow babies across the way left the nest, learned to feed themselves and departed for Florida with their parents.","Thus passed a fantastic vacation. I’m thankful to my pals and colleagues for covering for me while I was gone, and I’m thrilled to be back.","What great cooking’s ahead of us. My colleague Eric Kim developed this ace recipe for karaage, Japanese fried chicken (above), after eating the chef Kaoru Ayabe’s version at 750 Myrtle Diner in Brooklyn. It’s a perfect weekend feed, the chicken marinated in ginger, soy and sake, then dipped in egg, coated in cornstarch, and fried slowly at 320 degrees until there’s a firm golden crust around the moist and flavorful meat.","Featured RecipeView Recipe →Watch Eric develop the recipe in this delightful and informative video on our YouTube channel, and then cook it yourself for dinner. Add a mushroom miso soup if you want more than just the chicken.","The Jewish new year begins this evening at sundown: Rosh Hashana, a time of inner renewal, sweet celebration. Big meals are customary for each night of the holiday, and if you’re still in need of ideas for what to cook, I present to you our very best Rosh Hashana recipes.","Like, maybe Joan Nathan’s recipe for brisket? You could make that Saturday morning early and it’d be perfect for the evening meal. Or there’s Joan’s recipe for baked fish with pomegranate sauce, which she adapted from one cooked by the Iraqi artist Oded Halahmy. Honey cake? Tsimmes? Challah for sure.","Heading in another direction entirely, you might consider Sohla El-Waylly’s new recipe for pizza salad — literally a pepperoni pizza in salad form. She fries strips of pepperoni until they’re crisp, then uses the spicy rendered fat to fry bread crumbs seasoned with the flavors of New York slice shops: oregano, garlic and red-pepper flakes. These go on top of a crisp salad of romaine lettuce, black olives, pepperoncini, red onion and milky mozzarella tossed in a grated tomato vinaigrette.","Whatever you do, cook! Thousands and thousands of recipes are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. The weekend is a perfect time to experiment with new flavors and techniques, and to bring the delicious into your life and the lives of those around you. Yes, you need a subscription to read our offerings. Subscriptions are what make this whole enterprise possible. If you haven’t already, I hope you will consider subscribing today. Thanks.","Reach out if you run into trouble with our technology: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you. Or if you’d like to pay us a compliment or tell me off personally, drop a line to foodeditor@nytimes.com. I can’t respond to every letter. But I read each one I get.","Now, it’s a far cry from anything to do with filling jelly doughnuts or making duck confit, but I ran into some great reading while I was away. There were relatively new releases — among them, the fantastic “Crook Manifesto” by Colson Whitehead and a huge-hearted beauty, “The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store,” by James McBride. Please read them.","But I found some deep cuts, too, if you’re interested in the dustier shelves in the library. “Loon Lake,” by E.L. Doctorow, for instance, published in 1980 (and reviewed in The Times by Christopher Lehman-Haupt). That’s a great American novel right there, strange and magical and weird.","Finally, I picked up some incredible miso at the farmers’ market in Brunswick, Maine, from Go-En Fermented Foods in Whitefield. If you get a chance to do that yourself, jump at it. Go-En is the business. I’ll see you on Sunday."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/dining/chicken-karaage-pizza-salad-and-a-golden-knot-of-challah.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/07/multimedia/EK-Chicken-Karaage-gvfq-copy/EK-Chicken-Karaage-gvfq-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-15 12:00:02.954+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:34.003767+00');

Nigerians prepare it differently from Ghanaians, who make it differently from Liberians. There are versions from Senegal, Cameroon and Sierra Leone. The debate over which is superior is always passionate, sometimes deadly serious. Each one is the best and only jollof rice.","An example: A few years ago, around Christmas, my colleague Helene Cooper prepared jollof rice for the Washington bureau of The New York Times. Helene was born in Liberia. She posted a picture of her dish on the social media site then known as Twitter, calling it “the real and righteous Liberian jollof rice. It is unequaled. West African pretenders with your rival nonsense, sit down.”Helene’s jollof rice won raves in the District that evening, but today I want to turn your attention to Yewande Komolafe’s jollof rice (above). (Yewande grew up in Nigeria, so it’s not for Helene.) Hers is a lovely recipe, perfect for making on a lazy Sunday afternoon, to serve with fried plantains, braised goat or just some chicken thighs tossed in salt, pepper and neutral oil, then roasted crisp.","Featured RecipeView Recipe →With Sunday dinner taken care of, we can turn to the rest of the week. …I love Ali Slagle’s easy recipe for herb-marinated seared tofu, with its bright, herby sauce. Add sliced celery, maybe avocado, some nuts and seeds? I think I will.","Another winner from Yewande: skillet chicken with peppers and tomatoes. The peppers and some onions melt down into a silky sauce brightened by sherry vinegar and cherry tomatoes, a perfect foil to the bone-in chicken, excellent with rice and, in my house, an oven-warmed baguette.","Weeknight dinners don’t come better or more easily than with Ali’s midnight pasta with roasted garlic, olive oil and chile, a version of pasta aglio e olio. It’s a little more complex than the original on account of the roasted garlic, but it’s no real chore if you make it in a toaster oven in the morning before work, while you’re reading The Times. (Y’oughta!)Melissa Clark’s recipe for crispy chickpea stew with greens and lemon is exceptional, with pops of salty feta, slicks of tender greens and the marvelous crunch of the fried chickpeas sprinkled on top. Best of all on a Thursday night: It takes only one pot.","You can close out Ali week with her lovely recipe for pastrami-spiced steak with charred cabbage — a really delicious, Canadian-adjacent dish that’s perfect alongside a drift of mashed potatoes. Fall’s coming!There are many thousands more recipes to cook this week waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. Yes, you need a subscription to read them. Subscriptions support our work and allow it to continue. So if you haven’t already, I hope you will consider subscribing today. Thanks extremely.","If you run into difficulties with our technology, reach out to us: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you. Or if you’d like to give us an apple or a worm, write directly to me: foodeditor@nytimes.com. I cannot respond to everyone. It’s a lot of mail. But I read every letter I get.","Now, it’s nothing to do with stinky cheeses or the sound of onions sizzling in butter, but I wanted to share a few more titles I took down over the course of my recent vacation — books worth reading, little gifts every one.","Here’s Siri Hustvedt’s 1996 novel “The Enchantment of Lily Dahl”: passionate, funny and mysterious. Also, Deepti Kapoor’s “Age of Vice,” an epic, luxe thriller set in contemporary India, published this year. I liked Scot Lehigh’s “Just East of Nowhere,” too, a dark coming-of-age tale set in a struggling Maine coastal town, also published this year.","Finally, let’s get super freaky, with Mordecai Richler’s “St. Urbain’s Horseman,” published in 1971. Time-travel to that decade’s weirdness, excess and wants, with plot and comedy to spare. Enjoy one or more of those, cook your jollof and I’ll see you next week."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/17/dining/the-joy-and-friendly-jostling-of-jollof-rice.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/24Nigerianrex1-copy/merlin_156459840_f874ce2c-2a73-4c58-b4e4-15cf91169bbb-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-17 15:00:02.907+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:34.529025+00');

and celebrities. Most restaurants don’t even last that long the first time. The new location, occupying prime real estate in Hudson Yards, is bigger, grander and yes, less intimate, on purpose. “When I thought about another BondSt I wondered what would make sense, especially in this space,” Mr. Morr said. “I can’t recapture the intimacy of three floors in a townhouse so I decided to make it totally different.” Designed by Jeffrey Beers, there’s a main dining room, a tropical patio sheathed in bamboo, a bar, an omakase counter and two rooms for private parties. The menu combines the food served at BondSt now with new grilled items like a Japanese Wagyu rib-eye, and old signatures like the tuna tarts. Marc Spitzer, a partner and executive chef, oversees operations. Brett Singer, who has been at BondSt for 10 years, and Daniel Su, the executive sushi chef, are in charge of food. With restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow as a partner, BondSt is poised to add Miami and London branches in the next couple of years.","BondSt Hudson Yards at the Shops and Restaurants at Hudson Yards, 20 Hudson Yards, Level 5 (West 32nd Street),  bondstrestaurant.com. Tucked into the mezzanine at Antoya, a Koreatown steak house, is this serene new spot done with gilded details that reflect a royal Korean dynasty. The chef, Taewoo Kim, offers a tasting menu for carnivores featuring prime rib, short rib, oxtail, bone marrow and barbecued galbi; $125 for seven courses. Kyungmoon Kim (no relation to the chef), a master sommelier, pairs Korean wines and spirits with the food.","37 West 32nd Street, 212-695-0021, wangbinyc.com. The Brooklyn collaboration between the restaurateur Gabriel Stulman and the chef April Bloomfield has opened. The menu in the nautical space, with vintage artifacts, features starters like brandade with fines herbes, Zuni Café’s anchovy celery, and mussel salad with roasted fennel and aioli. A brief selection of mains includes black sea bass with mushrooms and celeriac, and roast chicken for two.","228 DeKalb Avenue (Clermont Avenue), Fort Greene, Brooklyn, sailor.nyc. The T refers to Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake who, along with Nexus Luxury Collection and 8am Golf, are behind this sprawling 22,000 square foot sports bar. Golf simulators, duck pin bowling and 35 televisions for watching sports are some of the features. Expect a burger, tuna sashimi and a lobster roll; craft cocktails, beers and wine, alcoholic and non, are served to drink at a long bar, high-tops, low tables and lounge chairs.

The second floor counter for 10-course tasting menus ($195) at the restaurateur Tony Park’s Korean steak house, in the townhouse that was once home to Felidia, has opened. The chef in charge, Kim Jeong-Muk, had been at Myomi in Seoul. A counter with 12 seats is where he will serve a seafood-leek pancake, carabineros shrimp with tomato gochujang, and duck with sunchokes, artichokes and soybean paste.","243 East 58th Street, 212-970-8888, anto.com. Named for an owner’s cute dogs, Neo and Leeloo, this low-key addition to choices in Brooklyn offers an imaginative menu that stocks up at local farms, then stops along the Mediterranean. A fougasse; socca with littleneck clams; Spanish mackerel crudo, with tomato, saffron and pistachio; and ricotta gnudi, with chanterelles, sage and corn, are some examples. Meatier choices include American Wagyu sirloin with leeks, foie gras and Sauternes jus for a relatively gentle $37. The restaurant is owned by Christophe Moser and Claudio Angelli. Mr. Moser’s son, Sean, is the sous chef.","284 Grand Street (Roebling Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, no phone, neeloobk.com. This pub run by the partners in the Dead Rabbit in the financial district has opened in the Moynihan Train Hall. A vintage look and drinks that include tweaked classics, like the Pullman Sleeper (in the manhattan style) and the Martini Express (a take on the espresso martini), and, of course, Guinness, are poured. Food comes from other purveyors in the train hall. It’s conceived as a template for expansion to other transit hubs.","Moynihan Hall, 421 Eighth Avenue (33rd Street), irishexit.com.","This new lunchtime cafe serving panini, salads and bowls, has opened in the garden in the newly redone 1984 Midtown skyscraper designed by Philip Johnson.

This past summer they added a no-frills outpost in Amagansett, N.Y., and now there’s a third, at Barclays Center. Like the others it sells slices and whole pies in New York and Sicilian styles with assorted toppings, seven in all; the lively long hot shallot pie is a standout. There’s also a Caesar salad.","Fini Pizza Barclays Plaza, 620 Atlantic Avenue (Flatbush Avenue), Park Slope, Brooklyn, 929-475-5669, finipizza.com.","An outpost of this popular Chinatown spot, in business since 2000, has opened in the East Village.","221 First Avenue (13th Street), 212-732-0797, dimsumgogonyc.com.

cream cheese and bagels. This year those bagels might be homemade if you participate in a class given by the bagel experts Reva Castillenti and Sam Silverman on Saturday at 4 or 6:30 p.m., at Bagel Market in Midtown. Or perhaps you’d just want to learn how to make bagels without any observance. Either way, the two-hour hands-on session involves rolling, boiling, seeding and baking the bagels, and taking a dozen of them home. Bagels to eat with spreads, plus beer and wine, will be served and bagel history will be revealed. There will also be a three-hour class to break the fast on Monday, Sept. 25, at 6 p.m., with more food to eat.","Bagel Making Classes for Yom Kippur, Saturday 4 and 6:30 p.m., and Monday at 6 p.m., each $150, Bagel Market, 264 West 40th Street, nycbageltours.com. Planning dinner for 1,000? Or even 100? The chef and philanthropist José Andrés can guide you through it with what might be a first: a disaster relief cookbook. The hefty, well-illustrated volume recounts the history of World Central Kitchen, the on-the-scene organization that has been dishing seasoned rice from four-foot paella pans, making rafts of sandwiches under makeshift tents and ladling Ukrainian borscht from 50-quart stockpots since it first came on the scene in 2010 after an earthquake struck Haiti. The recipes, including that borscht, a lush stovetop mac and cheese with variations, an easygoing chicken chili verde, and a fresh salad with the clever addition of chicharrones, feed four to six generously; there are instructions for scaling down or up, should you find yourself home alone or running a soup kitchen. Profiles of workers and stories about the foods are included.","“The World Central Kitchen Cookbook: Feeding Humanity, Feeding Hope” by José Andrés and World Central Kitchen with Sam Chapple-Sokol (Clarkson Potter, $35). There is a new sauce in the collection from Poi Dog, which was the name of the chef Kiki Aranita’s Philadelphia restaurant that closed in 2020, and now identifies the products. With miso, Chinese five-spice and pineapple, you have the umami-rich Huli Huli, a version of a marinade and baste for rotisserie chickens on the islands, which enhances just about anything. In addition to Huli Huli, Poi Dog also has Guava Katsu, sharper than the Huli Huli, and Chili Peppah Water, a vinegary and fruity condiment. Through the end of the month the company is donating 10 percent of proceeds to World Central Kitchen’s Maui Relief Fund.","Poi Dog Huli Huli, $17 for 12 ounces; Guava Katsu, $16 for 12 ounces, Chili Peppah Water, $9 for 5.2 ounces, poidogphilly.com. These sleek insulated bags, designed for carrying wine, are from a new company, Panier, founded by Nic Bradley, who has been in the wine business, and Dhruv Singh, an entrepreneur.

Like pulling a vintage bottle from the wine cellar, John Anderson, who founded Woodhouse Chocolate in St. Helena, Calif., with his wife, Tracy Wood Anderson, has dug into the chocolate company’s vault to bring back the TAB bar: toffee-almond-butter.

They’ll be available through the end of October.","Woodhouse Chocolate, Dark Toffee Almond Butter Bar, Milk Toffee Almond Butter Bar, $12 for three (3.9 ounces), woodhousechocolate.com. Though sweeteners like ginger syrup, agave syrup and even simple syrup may barely be used by the ounce in most cocktails, it’s nice to have a good supply on hand. Refrigerated, they keep well. Cheeky Cocktails, a Brooklyn company founded by April Wachtel, a cocktail instructor, is now selling its vibrant syrups in 750 milliliter (25.4-ounce) bottles: espresso, cranberry, honey, honey-ginger, ginger, agave and basic simple syrup. The syrups, which are effective in iced tea and over fresh fruit, are made without added colorings, flavorings or preservatives. Need less? They come in four and 16-ounce sizes. The company also sells lemon and lime juices, good to have on hand for emergencies, though fresh is always better.","Cheeky Cocktails syrups, $22 to $37, cheekycocktails.co.

While I might push it aside when I’m reaching for a sheet pan, there are so many recipes that simply work better in a casserole dish. Lidey Heuck’s one-pan roasted fish with cherry tomatoes is an excellent example.","The high sides of the 9x13-inch pan keep all the liquid from evaporating, giving you moist white fish fillets (use any kind you like) and juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes and shallots, all seasoned with honey, sherry vinegar and lemon zest. It’s a delightful five-star recipe, and weeknight friendly, too.","Featured RecipeView Recipe →If you’re itching to use your sheet pans (and I know how that feels!), Yewande Komolafe uses a pair of them for her breakfast burritos, which are just as good for dinner. While you use the sheet pans to melt cheese on multiple tortillas in the oven, you quickly scramble the eggs and slice up the avocado to put on top along with some cumin-y refried beans.","That’s two for your oven, but let’s not forget the top of your stove, because that’s where the pasta happens! Ever on my mind as summer slips away is Naz Deravian’s lovely, autumnal kale and walnut pasta. Naz uses toasted nuts instead of bread crumbs for a crunchy, chile-flecked topping over a soft cushion of olive oil-infused kale and pasta.","Using only one skillet (and one big salad bowl), Yewande’s ginger chicken with crisp napa salad combines cayenne- and cilantro-spiced chicken breasts with a very zippy cabbage, cucumber and mint salad perfect for absorbing all the meaty pan drippings. And for a one-skillet meal without the meat, there’s my coconut red curry with tofu, ideal for using up the last odds and ends of whatever vegetables you have in the fridge, all simmered together with jarred curry paste and coconut milk.","For dessert, let’s go back to the oven to bake up a batch of David Tanis’s buttery, cardamom-scented pecan shortbread (which could also be made with walnuts if you have any leftover from the pasta). Shortbread keeps exceptionally well, so you can snack on the leftovers all week long. I love to dunk it in my tea for breakfast.","Right now, for a limited time, you can view all these recipes for free. Just download the New York Times Cooking app to start your free trial.

most excited about over here at The New York Times. Members of the Cooking and Food teams travel all year long to scout restaurants for this annual list. It is thrilling and delicious, and I hope you’ll take a look.","But you have to eat dinner tonight, and I think the five dishes below are exceptionally good. And now, for a limited time, you can view these recipes at no cost, along with about 22,000 others. Just download the NYT Cooking app to start your free trial (iOS users can download it here, while Android users can use this link).","Ruminations? Requests? Write to me anytime at dearemily@nytimes.com. I love to hear from you.","Yewande Komolafe makes one-pan magic with saucy bell peppers, onions and cherry tomatoes. This new recipe cooks entirely on your stove — no oven — and seamlessly bridges summer and fall.","View this recipe.","This is creamy comfort food by way of South India, but made with a few nontraditional ingredients that Priya Krishna keeps in her kitchen in New York. The combination of textures makes this dish especially satisfying (though the easy, fast prep doesn’t hurt, either).","View this recipe.","For this crazy simple recipe, Mark Bittman takes the French method of cooking food in parchment (en papillote) and swaps it out for tinfoil. Use parchment paper if you happen to have it around, but you won’t be disappointed if you follow this recipe to the letter.","View this recipe.","Maybe you’re thinking, “Emily, this is not dinner?” But it could be if you scooch some of the broccoli over to one side of the pan and add a few salted, boneless chicken thighs, brushed with olive oil, or maybe some white beans. Or both! Add a second pan if the first gets too crowded. The recipe is by Ali Slagle, so you know it’s user-friendly.","View this recipe.","Success is in the details in Ham El-Waylly’s new, extremely simple recipe, so be sure to read the steps before cooking so your sauce is creamy as can be. If you can’t easily get labneh, use Greek yogurt; the spice mix za’atar, made with sesame seeds and dried herbs, is easier to find in the United States than ever before (or you can make your own).","View this recipe.","Thanks for reading and cooking.

'By Pete Wells', 'food', '["Since it opened on a high-traffic strip of Avenue A in the spring, Foxface Natural has kept a low profile, as discreet and self-contained as a sealed envelope. At times it almost seems to be hiding. Slats on the window make it hard to see inside from the street. The exterior is painted battleship gray. There is no sign.","Nevertheless, the restaurant has attracted a small and fervent following. I don’t know many people who’ve eaten there so far, at least compared with Libertine or the new I Sodi, but the ones I do know say it’s their favorite new restaurant. It has become one of mine, too.","Whether it will be yours may depend on your tolerance for eccentricity. The soundtrack is heavy on recent Australian punk bands like Amyl and the Sniffers, the Chats and Alien Nosejob, played loud. The menu demands an adventurous spirit. If you get the whole fluke, roasted in a wood oven and served in a lake of olive oil with fistfuls of chopped garlic and parsley, the fish will not be filleted for you on a tableside gueridon. You will pick the flesh from the bones yourself.","For the right diners, this will be an exciting chance to learn about flatfish anatomy. For the wrong ones, it will be a nightmare. As a dinner companion in the first category put it while he was contemplating how best to eat the dorsal fin, which had browned in the oil into a long, crunchy and, as it turned out, delicious ridge, “This is not a restaurant for Karens.”Foxface Natural describes itself in its Instagram bio as “a natural continuation of Foxface sandwiches.” This is like calling day a natural continuation of night. It’s accurate, but it leaves a lot unsaid.","The last time I’d seen the name Foxface, it was on a sign outside what had once been the ticket office of Theatre 80 St Marks. Behind a window, sandwiches filled with things like elk osso buco or stewed tripe with ’nduja were being sold by a couple who live next door to the theater, Sivan Lahat and Ori Kushnir. They had no room for seats, but if you wanted to eat your sandwich right away they’d invite you to take it inside a tavern next door that specialized in very old film soundtracks and absinthe. This kept up for about three years before Foxface closed last September.","I haven’t seen any elk or tripe yet at Foxface Natural. But that doesn’t mean that Ms. Lahat and Mr. Kushnir have settled into a routine of chicken tenders. Roasted antelope chops appeared one night recently, and you can usually find a very good hand-chopped tartare of kangaroo. Raw kangaroo has a deeper and sometimes gamier flavor than beef, and David Santos, the executive chef, takes advantage of that by incorporating a complex spice blend inspired by Ethiopia into the purplish meat and serving it with a smoky, black purée of charred eggplant.","The meat that made the deepest impression on me was smoked Boer goat. A breed developed in South Africa, Boers are raised for eating, as opposed to milking or making into angora sweaters. Mr. Santos cooks it overnight at a low temperature in a smoker inherited from the last tenant, Harry & Ida’s Meat and Supply Co.","The pastrami that Harry & Ida’s made in it became an obsession for lovers of smoked meat. Foxface’s goat is a worthy successor to the pastrami — maybe even a natural continuation. What it most reminds me of, though, is Texas Hill Country barbecue, if pitmasters in Texas served their barbecue with things like saffron-scented tomato sauce and creamy roasted new-crop potatoes.","The mammals are likely to be the first thing most people notice about the menu. After four meals at Foxface Natural, though, I’ve come to think of it as a seafood restaurant that occasionally dabbles in antelope. Although most of the fish Mr. Santos serves are the opposite of exotic — he favors black sea bass, striped bass and a few other fixtures of the local waters— he is particular about whom he buys them from. He prefers fish that are caught on the end of a line by crews that practice the Japanese slaughtering technique known as ikejime.","This method, thought to be more humane, also keeps the fish firm. You may notice the texture in uncooked dishes like the Boston mackerel that he cured in salt and apple vinegar one night. This was a take on a sushi-bar standard, served with a very un-Japanese sweet-pepper relish spooned over a fermented-pepper purée on a plate dotted with beehive-shaped domes of ricotta. (Like the heap of salted butter that accompanies each order of sourdough bread, the ricotta is made at the restaurant.)I am sure, too, that ikejime was one thing that made it so pleasurable to dismantle and compare the flavors and textures of different parts of the roasted fluke, or to pull the flesh from the head, throat and belly of a butterflied black sea bass. But the thing that will really win over people who appreciate fresh fish is that Mr. Santos never seems to overcook it. He’ll pull it from the fire while there’s still some pink at the bone and sticky jellies still cling to the cartilage.","Dave Pasternack used to cook fish that way when Esca was still open. Eric Ripert and a handful of other chefs still do, but many others won’t. No doubt they get tired of having customers send fish back if it’s not completely firm and almost dry. So far, Mr. Santos doesn’t seem worried about that.","Of course, diners who won’t eat slightly pink sea bass may be reluctant to sign on for certain other items at Foxface Natural, too. Boiled gooseneck barnacles, for instance, which have been compared to dinosaur toes. Or the squares of grilled pig ear topped with white strips that look suspiciously like offal. These turn out to be the pickled skirt trimmed from a scallop — shellfish offal. They are very good dragged through a salsa verde tasting of parsley and cilantro, or a second sauce, a garlic-infused emulsion based on Basque pil-pil.","Mr. Santos, who was the chef and owner of a Portuguese restaurant in the Village called Louro until it closed eight years ago, brings a wide frame of reference to his kitchen. Some of his cooking, like the pil-pil and the fluke in olive oil, is flat-out Iberian. For striped bass steaks roasted on the spine he chose a spiced tomato sauce, chraime, originally from North Africa. The black sea bass, painted with turmeric sauce and splashed with what was essentially dill pistou, seemed to be an inspired reworking of the signature dish of Hanoi’s most famous fish restaurant, Cha Ca La Vong.","Most of the main courses at Foxface Natural will feed two. When an especially large fish has come in, it may be enough for three or four. “We’re not small-plates people,” Ms. Lahat said across the counter one night.","They are, however, natural-wine people. The wines themselves are quite approachable, although the list is sometimes less than self-explanatory. The entire entry for one white poured by the glass reads “GraWü, Chourmo.” Does GraWü go down well with raw kangaroo? There is, it’s safe to say, only one place in New York to find out.","Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

'By Melissa Clark', 'food', '["I nearly always end this newsletter with a dessert, as my sweet tooth demands, but sometimes you have to start off with a treat. And Jessie Sheehan’s Nutella brownies demand a spot right at the top.","Using only four ingredients — Nutella, flour, eggs, salt — and one bowl and a spatula for mixing, it’s a paragon of simplicity that delivers big. These brownies are chewy and creamy with a judicious hit of salt. They are Nutella made into hand food, more dignified than surreptitiously scarfing the chocolate hazelnut spread straight from the jar.","Featured RecipeView Recipe →OK, fine, you should probably eat dinner first. So while the brownies are in the oven, use your grill (or stovetop grill) to cook Yossy Arefi’s punchy, spicy harissa shrimp, a perfect weeknight recipe that takes 15 minutes from start to finish. The harissa does the heavy lifting, contributing heat from chiles along with fragrant spices like cumin and coriander (depending on the brand). Harissa pastes vary a lot, so it’s worth experimenting to find a brand you like.","Just as fuss-free and nearly as quick are Kay Chun’s Korean BBQ-style meatballs, which use Ritz cracker crumbs as a binder (though you can substitute bread crumbs if that’s what you’ve got). If you keep ground meat in the freezer and soy sauce in the cupboard, these make a terrific pantry meal.","You could also counterbalance your impending brownie blowout with some virtuous vegetables, and Yewande Komolafe’s roasted vegetables with cashew romesco are just the thing. The sauce, seasoned with smoked paprika, sherry vinegar and garlic, is an alchemical miracle that would help anything taste amazing. Save leftover sauce for tofu, fish, chicken or even fried eggs. It’s a vibrant lift that’s always gone too soon.","Speaking of gone too soon, exeunt summer tomatoes and eggplants, alas. But you can still make a big panful of fragrant, olive-oil-rich zaalouk before they disappear. Nargisse Benkabbou’s recipe for the traditional Moroccan cooked salad is a bit like baba ghanouj in texture, but with the bright sweetness and acidity of fresh tomatoes suffused throughout. Serve it with flatbread for dipping, or spread it on a sandwich for lucky lunchbox luggers all week long.","You do need to subscribe to get these and all of the other excellent recipes at New York Times Cooking. If a technical issue or question comes up, you can email the smart people at cookingcare@nytimes.com. And I’m at hellomelissa@nytimes.com if you want to say hi.","Say you’re hankering for meatballs, but your ground meat is a frozen block. Here’s my favorite method for a quick defrost: Unwrap the meat and place it in a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag, squeezing out the air. (If it’s vacuum-packed, leave it as is.) Place your meat on a metal pan (aluminum is best) on the counter, then turn the meat block every 15 minutes. The metal conducts heat and really helps speed up defrosting."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/dining/four-ingredient-nutella-brownies-with-a-five-minute-prep-time.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/15/multimedia/s-nutella-brownies-wtfl-copy/s-nutella-brownies-wtfl-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 15:00:02.989+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:38.110627+00');

'By Priya Krishna', 'food', '["Three years ago, B. Dylan Hollis was an unemployed musician in Wyoming who had never baked anything outside a home-economics class, much less written a recipe. Last month, his debut cookbook, “Baking Yesteryear,” became the best-selling book in the country.","Not just the best-selling cookbook — the No. 1 book.","“Baking Yesteryear,” which features vintage American recipes, sold 150,000 copies on its first day, and was one of the most preordered books in the history of its publisher, Penguin Random House — just behind memoirs by the Obamas and Prince Harry.","Mr. Hollis has no political career or royal-family drama propelling his book. What he does have is 10.2 million followers on TikTok, where he has been posting cooking videos since 2020.","“I feel as if I have stolen someone else’s job,” he said with a chuckle in a recent video interview from his home in Laramie.","Mr. Hollis, 28, has big, curious eyes and a shapely swoop of hair, and peppers his rapid-fire speech with quaint expressions like “Oh, heavens!” Like many people, he got bored during the pandemic and began baking. Instead of making sourdough, he channeled his love for all things antique into preparing recipes from old community cookbooks.","His August 2020 TikTok video about pork cake racked up millions of views, and less than two years later, he signed a cookbook deal for what he would only describe as a “grand amount of money.”He is one of several TikTok creators, many of them with little or no professional cooking experience, who have gone from tinkering in their home kitchens to topping best-seller lists in a remarkably short time. In the process, they’ve shot a jolt of energy into a sagging cookbook market.","Overall sales of cookbooks have fallen 14.5 percent from a year ago, according to the consumer analytics company Circana, and the top 50 cookbooks sold an average of 96,000 copies in the last 12 months.","By comparison, “An Unapologetic Cookbook” by Joshua Weissman (seven million TikTok followers) has sold 316,000 copies. “The Korean Vegan” by Joanne Lee Molinaro (three million followers) has sold 102,000 and won a James Beard award. And Mr. Hollis’s “Baking Yesteryear” has sold more than 165,000. (Those impressive figures, though, are far from the million-plus sales of an established superstar like Joanna Gaines.)No one is more surprised than Mr. Hollis.","“I have only been baking for two years,” said Mr. Hollis, who divides his time between Wyoming and Bermuda, where he grew up. “To be known for baking without being trained or even particularly well versed in the topic, now that is a very peculiar notion.","“You have to ask yourself, ‘Who deserves to publish a cookbook?’” he said.","The answer is changing rapidly. TikTok has altered what people look for in a cookbook — or a cookbook author, said Vanessa Santos, the executive vice president of the publicity firm Mona Creative, which represents several cookbook writers.","“A recipe doesn’t need to be all that new or perfect,” she said. “It is really just: Are they connecting with a personality?”Not everyone agrees, even cookbook authors with big fan bases of their own.","“When you do a 20-second video making a cake, it is really entertaining and interesting,” said David Lebovitz, 64, the Paris-based cookbook author who started his food blog in 1999 and publishes a popular newsletter on Substack. “But once again, people want solid recipes.”Mr. Hollis is far from the first amateur cook to snag a major book deal. The internet long ago democratized the notion of who can be an author, and publishers have sought to translate online followings — from food blogs in the 1990s and 2000s to Instagram accounts in the 2010s — into cookbook success.","“But nothing has converted quite as well as TikTok to actual sales,” said Kristen McLean, an analyst at Circana.","Soon after the cookbook author Deb Perelman, 47, started the Smitten Kitchen blog in 2006, she received offers for short, quick-turnaround cookbooks for foods like holiday cookies.","“With TikTok people, I see them writing real, 300-page hard-core serious cookbooks,” she said. “That, to me, is showing that the publishing industry realizes what they have in front of them.”And publishers are ponying up. TikTok creators are receiving the kind of advances that celebrity television hosts might get — “definitely in the high six- or even over six-figure range,” said Anthony Mattero, an agent at Creative Artists Agency who represents several TikTok creators.","“TikTok is the greatest selling machine right now,” said Nadia Caterina Munno, 40, who parlayed her TikTok audience of 3.1 million followers into a deal for a cookbook, “The Pasta Queen.” Released last November, it debuted at No. 5 on The New York Times “Advice, How-to and Miscellaneous” list. (She and the others interviewed for this article declined to share the exact amounts of their book deals.)Ms. Munno’s TikTok career took off with a video she posted in 2020 criticizing another creator’s attempt at lasagna. Now, she said, “I am making more money than my husband. I am the breadwinner.”Beyond the money, publishing a cookbook carries prestige — even for people who are already stars online.","“It was such an honor to do a book,” said Jenny Martinez, 49, a Los Angeles mother of four who used to sell forklifts and now runs a TikTok account with 3.5 million followers; her cookbook, “My Mexican Mesa, y Listo!” will be released in April. A cookbook is “another level, and such an accomplishment for a publisher to believe in me.”But having millions of followers doesn’t guarantee a blockbuster book, said Mike Sanders, the vice president and publisher of DK United States, which recently created a division devoted to books by online personalities.","Mr. Sanders spends time reading online comments, “just looking at the connection that the TikToker or social media creators have with the fans that might enable them to break through the noise,” he said.","The comments on Mr. Hollis’s videos convinced Mr. Sanders that “Baking Yesteryear” would sell. In just the past two years, DK United States, a division of Penguin Random House, has published six New York Times best-selling cookbooks by authors popular on TikTok.","It can take considerable work to turn a video celebrity into a paper-and-ink cookbook author. Some of the people Mr. Sanders recruited hadn’t formally written recipes and didn’t understand all that’s involved in producing a cookbook. “We are comfortable finding these authors on our own, and developing them and nurturing them and surrounding them with the support to make these books happen,” he said.","That support can mean pairing the author with recipe testers, or running the photo shoot. DK even provides authors with strategies for advertising their books on TikTok, whose algorithm is sophisticated enough to identify and suppress promotional posts, Mr. Sanders said.","Barbara Costello, 74, a retired preschool teacher in New Canaan, Conn., is one of DK’s authors and a TikTok creator whose grandmotherly persona has earned her 3.9 million followers. She said she was surprised at just how much work went into writing a recipe — measuring every ingredient, determining precise bake times and writing introductions.","The cookbook, “Celebrate With Babs,” was a hit, selling close to 100,000 copies since its release in April 2022. It drew some press coverage, but Ms. Costello said her TikTok videos about the book more effectively drove sales.","TikTok not only moves merchandise; it also shapes the look and feel of these books.","Ms. Molinaro, 44, the author of “The Korean Vegan,” became known on TikTok for narrated cooking videos in which she shares stories about her life. When her editor trimmed back many of the personal essays in her book, she refined them and insisted they be added back. She photographed the recipes herself to match her online aesthetic. She even enlisted her social media followers to vote on the cover.","In his upcoming cookbook, “Kung Food,” Jon Kung, who has 1.7 million TikTok followers, included QR codes that link to his videos. “How to fold dumplings or knead bread or make pasta, those things will always be hard to try to explain in words,” said Mr. Kung, 39.","Ms. Munno, the author of “The Pasta Queen,” said she doubled the number of photographs of herself and beautiful Italian landscapes in her cookbook so it looked more like her TikTok account.","Many readers have told her that they bought the cookbook to enjoy the pictures, but haven’t cooked a single recipe.","Still, plenty of people buy these cookbooks for the recipes.","Janvi Joshi, 26, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., and works in finance, has cooked about seven dishes from the “The Korean Vegan.” She said that with recipes written in captions on social media, “the measurements and stuff might be a little bit off.","“When you are going through recipes in a cookbook, they are a little more thought-out and tested,” she said.","But Mr. Hollis worries that the more of his fellow TikTok creators get cookbook deals, the less credible their books may become. The field may become too saturated.","“Everyone and their dog is about to have a cookbook,” he said, “and who knows what that is going to do?”Then again, Mr. Hollis is already thinking about his next cookbook.","Audio produced by Tally Abecassis.","Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

This recipe isn’t it.","The tried-and-true method produces lissome, velvety peppers with a concentrated, sweet flavor. But it’s also a pain.","Charring the whole peppers over an open flame, then steaming, cooling, peeling, seeding and deveining them, is time-consuming and messy, and it leaves sooty flecks of pepper skin clinging to everything they touch and even some things they don’t. I’m happy to occasionally trot out the whole process when I’m making something special, but it’s a lot of hoops to clear on any given Tuesday.","Here, then, is my Tuesday night pepper hack, with a streamlined yet effective technique that gives great results any day of the week. Any week peppers are in season, that is.","Not peeling the peppers saves you the most time here. I’ve learned that if you slice them thin and roast them long enough, they collapse into tender strands that caramelize at the edges — and taste so good you’ll never even notice the skin.","Slicing peppers lengthwise into strips, as opposed to crosswise into rings, look elegant, and make the veins and seeds easy to cut away as you go. That is the only knife work involved, apart from mincing some garlic and herbs, so chopping time is minimal.","I like to mix fleshy, multihued bell peppers with a medium-spicy pepper (such as Hungarian wax, Jimmy Nardello or Cubanelle) for a range of flavors and a sunset of colors. Tossed with olive oil, salt and herbs, these peppers can form the base of countless sheet-pan meals. Top them with fish fillets, chicken, sausages or simply the canned chickpeas I use here, which crisp and turn golden as they roast.","If you want to keep things vegan (and simple), you can stop there, perhaps rounding out the meal with bread for plate- and pan-mopping (sticky, olive oil-infused pepper juices are so delicious).","On the other hand, a small handful of crumbled goat cheese sprinkled on top adds a lovely creaminess, tang and depth, melting slightly as it hits the warm pan. Other soft cheeses, such as feta, chunks of burrata or mozzarella, or ricotta salata, will work nicely, too. Whichever version you like, you’ll have a resplendent sheet-pan meal that captures the heights of pepper season, even in the depths of the workweek.","Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

This one-pot rice masterpiece is often referred to as the national dish of Senegal, yet its presence and popularity extend beyond any national borders. Its influence is powerful.","So many of West Africa’s other great one-pot rice dishes — Ghanaian waakye, Gambian benachin and Nigerian jollof, to name just a few — are direct descendants of thieboudienne (pronounced CHE-boo JEN), named for the Wolof words for rice (ceeb or thiebb) and fish (jën).","Jollof rice’s popularity, especially in the diaspora, can be attributed to how quickly it comes together, essentially a sped-up version of thieboudienne. A great thieboudienne, however, resists all shortcuts. A great thieboudienne is practically an all-day affair.","“This is the diva of rice cooked in a tomato broth,” said Nafy Ba Flatley, a Senegalese cook and small-business owner in San Francisco.","Thieboudienne is what I like to call a “process” recipe because each step is essential to the finished dish. To my palate, a great rice dish, with its flavors layered upon one another, is like a puzzle to be solved. It is not enough to scarf down heaped spoonfuls, although I do plenty of that. I try to piece together the herbs, spices, stocks and pantry staples that went into its creation. I love decoding the process of a dish — how it goes from simple ingredients to a subtle riot of my senses — and this is why I love thieboudienne.","Originally developed in Saint-Louis, in the northwest coastal region of Senegal, where seafood is abundant, thieboudienne celebrates each ingredient in the pot.","Herb-heavy rof perfumes and seasons the fish (chioff or thiof, an Atlantic white grouper); nokoss — a blend of onions, bell peppers, chiles and fresh tomatoes — thickens the rich tomato broth. The end result is tender vegetables and fish layered over fluffy rice. It’s all garnished with xońe or xoñe, those bits of crunchy rice grains that, by proximity to heat, stick to the bottom of the pot. “We don’t let it go,” Ms. Flatley said. “It has to be scraped, all the way!”To achieve sophisticated complexity, thieboudienne requires a confident hand in the technique of flavor development. It’s an approach that can be used with many other great West African dishes. Shortcuts cannot be made.","“They take their time,” said Ms. Flatley of the cooks who’ve made particularly memorable thieboudienne in Saint-Louis. “They start cooking at 9 a.m., and we won’t sit down to eat until about 1 p.m. That’s what makes it so special.”In her San Francisco kitchen, it takes her a full two hours. She will make substitutions up to a point: Cauliflower can stand in for cabbage, but cassava and okra are required for her pot.","The experience of cooking thieboudienne can also be collaborative. Many cooks will barter with neighbors for ingredients and enjoy the dish together as a celebratory meal.","Late in my recipe testing process, I collaborated with my colleague Mia Leimkuhler in her kitchen in Montreal. She found some brilliantly fresh red snapper chunks from her local fishmonger, a bag of broken rice and a jar of tomato paste from the local grocery store. I brought a late-summer market selection of carrots, green beans, cabbage and chiles. We chopped, pulsed and cooked while a grueling tennis match played on the television in the background. The game cast a lively urgency over our preparations, and we eventually sat down to a deeply satisfying family-style meal.","“Thieboudienne is the queen,” Ms. Flatley said, adding, “It’s soul food.”Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

Park’s mother cherished it, as fresh honey was coveted for its health properties in South Korea, and doled it out only when someone got sick. Stirred into a mug of hot water with a little ginger, the honey made fine tea. “We were drinking it almost like medicine,” Mr. Park said.","Perhaps no Korean dish represents the value of honey more than the ancient dessert yakgwa, a deep-fried honey cookie soaked in syrup. Yakgwa (“yak” means medicine and “gwa” means confection) is more than a vessel for coveted sweetness. It connects generations and tells the story of Korea’s reverence for tradition and optimism for the future.","Enjoyed since the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), these treats have seen a resurgence in popularity in South Korea and beyond, thanks in part to videos on YouTube and TikTok, and Korean dramas like the Netflix series “Alchemy of Souls.”South Korea’s “Generation MZ” (a hybrid of millennials and Gen Zers) are the drivers of this new fixation on the past, more specifically young Koreans who call themselves “halmaenials” (a portmanteau of the words “halmoni,” meaning grandma, and millennial). This nostalgic generation has revitalized not only the culinary custom of yakgwa, but also the market for it.","In South Korea, new boutique companies like Golden Piece and Jangin Hangwa are focused on selling yakgwa for modern tastes, with flavors ranging from the original ginger-honey to lavender, chocolate and even cookies-and-cream.","It can be more difficult to get your hands on these cookies than it is to reserve a table at Tatiana at Lincoln Center, and demand has necessitated an online ticketing system known as “yakketing,” where eager yakgwa consumers place orders with independent businesses. Shops in Korea can sell out in 60 seconds.","Koreans have long sought after yakgwa with this sort of enthusiasm. Kings of Korea’s Goryeo dynasty even banned the making and eating of yakgwa because the popularity of its main ingredients — wheat, honey and sesame oil — created scarcity and sent prices soaring.","Traditionally, yakgwa was served only on special occasions, such as festival days like Chuseok and Seollal, birthdays and at life’s four rites of passage, known as gwan-hon-sang-je: coming-of-age (gwan), marriage (hon), death (sang) and the veneration of the dead (je), a custom which many families still practice today.","The lesson is universal: Only in maturing through life do you get to partake in its richest pleasures.","When Hyaeweol Choi’s mother died in 2012, the funeral made her realize the power of gathering at life’s critical junctures, including in death. Funerals are meeting points, said Dr. Choi, a gender historian and professor of Korean studies at the University of Iowa, where strong bonds are forged among relatives, both living and dead, who are otherwise “scattered over time.”A year later, Dr. Choi performed the fourth rite of passage for her mother in the form of jesa, which involves setting a large table with candles and a rich assortment of food and drink offerings for the deceased.","If Dr. Choi’s mother had a specialty, it was her encyclopedic knowledge of Korean ceremonial foods like yakgwa and how to present them. That’s why the recent commercialization of the cookie, with its ubiquity among young people who respect the tradition enough to reinterpret it, has delighted Dr. Choi. “Food evolves constantly, adjusting to new demands and new tastes,” she said.","Today, Koreans enjoy yakgwa outside of those rites of passage, like as an after-school snack or weekday dessert with vanilla ice cream. The Korean restaurant Cho Dang Gol in Manhattan serves on-the-house packages of delicious mini yakgwa at the end of the meal with your check, like soft mints or sticks of gum.","Still, a bite of homemade yakgwa tends to exceed anything store-bought, nine times out of 10. Since yakgwa is fried, the oil can go rancid in mass-produced packaged versions, so making the cookies from scratch is a quest worth pursuing. When fresh, the cookie’s sticky, amber syrup should drip off slowly, drenching your fingers, like Winnie the Pooh’s paw, in honey.","While the chewy outside gives way, the crunchy interior resists slightly. (The YouTube star and cookbook author Maangchi uses the word “juicy” to describe biting into fresh yakgwa.)This idiosyncratic dough is a tangle of flour, sesame oil, soju, honey and spices. In my yakgwa, ground ginger and cinnamon recall the gently sugared flavors of Korean staples like sujeonggwa, a refreshing cinnamon punch, and yaksik, a lovely sweetened rice with chestnuts, pine nuts and jujubes (a kind of red date).","The crispy, flaky fried cookies are dunked in a glossy jocheong, a not-too-sweet Korean brown rice syrup, which here is boiled with chunks of fresh ginger and a little honey.","In many ways, the frying is as easy as baking; your medium just happens to be a steady, simmering pool of oil, crowded with disks of dough. They puff ever so slightly to reveal their layers. Soaking crunchy cookie in gingery syrup requires patience, but that’s all right. The sweetest things in life take time.","Yakgwa comes in all shapes and sizes, depending on the mold, though the fluted flower shape may be the most common. In “The Korean Cookbook,” written by Mr. Park, the chef who sips honey like medicine, and the researcher and chef Jungyoon Choi, there’s a recipe for a crispier, flakier variation of yakgwa in the form of rectangles. This style is emblematic of a rich food culture Mr. Park called a “hidden gem of Korean cuisine,” from the city of Kaesong in North Korea.","“Of course we cannot go there anymore,” he said. But that doesn’t mean there’s not a connection. “We share the culture, we share the language and we share the food as well.”Despite its ancient roots, yakgwa is hardly a time capsule.

Maine, when the last of the wildflowers go golden on their stems — when the temperatures dip, fishermen pull their traps from the water, hunters wait in the woods and farmers gather the final crops — the time finally comes for “tipping,” or, as the old-timers call it, “brushing.” This is the time of year when folks head into the woods to gather the ends of evergreen branches for use in wreaths and holiday trimmings.","Ten-year-old Harbor Eaton lives with her family on Darthia Farm on Maine’s Schoodic Peninsula. The Eaton family primarily grows produce crops, but balsam-harvesting and wreath-making is a way of extending the farm’s production into the colder, darker seasons. In November and December, Harbor goes out tipping with her family and farm workers on adjacent woodlots, with the aid of their horses, Andy and Starr.","“You go out into the woods, try to find a tree with good foliage. You take a branch, snap it and make sure it doesn’t have brown spots on it — ’cause you don’t want a brown wreath,” Harbor explained.","Cedar, Harbor’s 7-year-old brother, said that the trick is to use a stick that’s sharpened on one end — with four branch stubs sticking out — to stack and collect the boughs into a portable unit.","“Do that over and over till you have filled the stick with branches,” Cedar said. “Then you put the stick on the wagon. You do it all over again until the horses pull us home with all the full sticks.”Balsam-harvesting is a welcome change of pace for farmers at the end of the season’s crescendo. “After spending the majority of our time focusing our energy on the soil and working looking down, we get into the woods and just stare at the trees, looking up toward the sky,” said Liz Moran, who manages Darthia Farm and raises Harbor and Cedar with her partner, Steve Eaton, known as Shepsi.","The process of tipping is hard work: the physical picking and pulling, the weight of the heavy branches. Tippers also need to keep an ear out for hunters in the forests, and pull off ticks at day’s end. But Ms. Moran describes a certain magic about the work: bringing warm treats to eat, noticing the soft patterns in the branches, letting the children play as they work, listening for the barred owl that lives near the entrance of the woodlot. The crew sometimes sing while they work, their voices echoing off the trees.","“The woods offer such a different acoustic environment than the open gardens and fields,” Mr. Eaton said. “It’s easier to hear each other in the woods if we are singing.”In Maine, especially in the state’s Downeast region, generations of people have built lives on seasonal, nature-based work: digging clams, pulling traps on commercial fishing boats, raking blueberries, processing seafood and crops. Harvesting balsam and making wreaths play important roles in this cycle.","Geri Valentine started making wreaths in the 1970s, and it’s still a part of her patchwork of seasonal jobs. As she wire-wrapped handfuls of evergreen around metal rings in a cozy cabin on Darthia Farm, she recalled her early days as a wreather. “Back then, it was mostly a cottage industry — people would go out in family groups to gather brush,” she said. “People like clam diggers and fishermen would go out brushing after the fishing season was over, and it was a way to bring in some income, especially right before Christmas, heading into the lean months.”Ms. Valentine has chosen a simple life. She lives in a cabin in the town of Addison without electricity and running water; she grows her own food with friends; she drives a used car. “I don’t want very much,” she said. “I change my jobs with the seasons.”“Living this way feels very grounded,” she continued. These days, though, people can’t survive as easily on seasonal work, she said. “If you have a truck payment, if you’ve got a mortgage, if you want to send your kids to college, you can’t swing a life of digging clams in the summer and making wreaths for Christmastime.”When you talk to locals, they agree: The systems have changed. The bigger wreath manufacturers, including Kelco Industries, Worcester Wreath Co. and Whitney Wreath, likely made the ones you find at your local grocery store or in catalogs. By some estimates, such companies employ about 2,000 migrant workers to harvest materials and work in wreath factories in Downeast Maine — often the same workers who harvested wild blueberries in summer and who returned to Maine for wreath season.","Among the migrant workers, there have been growing concerns about low wages, substandard housing, exploitative work conditions and a lack of access to health care and education. Nonprofits like Mano en Mano and the Maine Farmer and Rancher Stress Assistance Network provide support to seasonal workers, including those employed by the wreath industry.","This year, local nonprofits collaborated with farmers to gather warm clothes, blankets and supplies for wreath workers who are often unprepared for the cold of New England in November and December. Mounds of donated goods piled up at drop-off sites — enough that Bo Dennis, a flower farmer and organizer, borrowed a clean cattle trailer to carry it all to Mano en Mano’s office in Milbridge.","Mr. Dennis grows flowers at his farm, Dandy Ram Farm, in Monroe, Maine, and is also on staff at Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, where he works on programs for beginner farmers. He offers his farmland for other queer farmers to find an entry point to agriculture and rural life. He’s tuned in to the networks of people and plants around him and the ways they may need support — and this mind-set extends to the forests.","“When we harvest, we are pruning a tree,” Mr. Dennis said, explaining that tippers only cut the last 12 to 15 inches of a tree branch — a sustainable practice. He loaded heavy bags of boughs into his truck, all harvested from a friend’s woodlot, a chunk of clear-cut land that had grown in with thick, scrubby trees.","Mr. Dennis mainly harvests balsam fir, supplemented with cedar, pine and juniper. He is careful about where he harvests, and on whose land. “As a trans person, I’m hyper-aware that I want to have consent with anything I’m doing, including having consent to the land,” he said.","By percentage, Maine is the most forested state in America; about 89 percent of the land is woodlands, most of which is privately owned. Independent tippers usually (but not always) get permission from private landowners to gather materials on their land — and, as with deer hunters or wild mushroom gatherers, tippers often know whom to ask and where to find what they need.","Rachel Alexandrou, a forager and artist who uses the name Giant Daughter, looks in a variety of places: overgrown properties that might benefit from pruning, weedy land, areas with trees too thick for them all to thrive. “I also harvest at abandoned sites,” she said, “like an abandoned Burger King that no one is tending to.”Ms. Alexandrou uses her background in horticulture and farming to influence the ways she gathers her materials. “I don’t want to be taking away,” she said. “I want to be using what makes sense to use.”“I pay attention to the way the plants are growing so that I know my harvesting is good for the ecosystem I’m harvesting from,” she added.","Most tippers will wait for three hard frosts before they harvest. If you bend a balsam bough in the summer, it won’t snap; after a few frosts, it will. The frost allows the branches to be harvested easily, at the right time in the tree’s growth cycle. This year, though, the frosts were worryingly erratic. It was warm enough to harvest in a T-shirt on some days.","Weather patterns, tides, fish, frosts, deer — these can be the favored conversational subjects in rural Maine. Tipping, too, offers common ground.","“I may have nothing to do with someone most of the year,” Mr. Eaton said, “but if I’m tipping, there is much to relate to.”Every so often, while working in the woods, the tippers stop to smell their hands. They smell like pitch, like the inside of trees. Dirt mingles with the sap. I see it over and over: tippers cupping their palms to their face and pulling pine needles from their hair. The smell is earthy and nostalgic. The wreaths will smell this way, too: joyful circles on front doors across the country, formed by the work of strangers, and made from trees that continue to grow.","Greta Rybus is a photojournalist based near Portland, Maine.

'By Franck Bohbot', 'travel', '["I’ll always remember the first time I stepped into Blipsy Bar on N. Western Avenue, in Los Angeles’s Koreatown. I felt like a teenager from the ’80s, here to escape the humdrum of the Hollywood crowds. I settled into the moody, retro atmosphere, watching people buy cheap drinks and looking nostalgically at the arcade games on offer: Ms. Pac-Man, Gun Fight, Track & Field, Paperboy.","The wall was lined with stuffed animals, the bar filled with vintage gadgets and toys. There was a dance floor and a disco light. In a way, the people around me had come here to escape reality, to immerse themselves in a digital alternative — and yet it all felt authentic.","For me, it was the beginning of a project that would become an obsession. I grabbed my small Leica and began shooting in the darkness with a wide-open aperture. I made a few photographs before the bartender caught me.","“Hey. No more pictures,” he said.","Although I grew up in France, I’ve long been interested in the arcade cultures in both Japan and America.","My fascination is partly a result of seeing these places portrayed in popular films, from “Jaws” and “Terminator 2” to “Back to the Future Part II” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” But arcades also remind me of my own childhood experiences — particularly during my teenage years, when, alone or with my friends, I’d hunt down a Street Fighter or Pac-Man arcade, or lose myself on a home console: Atari, Nintendo, Sega.","When I first arrived in Los Angeles, in 2018, I found the city difficult to make sense of, difficult to navigate. I’d never spent time in a place so sprawling. Visiting and documenting the city’s arcades gave me a framework through which to explore — first within the bounds of the city itself, and then into the beach towns and desert oases of Orange and Riverside counties.","My goal, in part, was to capture contemporary photographs that might just as easily have been taken in the ’80s or ’90s.","I was also drawn by the diversity of the people and the environments. Each arcade draws a slightly different crowd, from beachgoers and barhoppers to seriously committed gamers. The atmospheres vary, too — some bright, pristine, ordered; some dark, moody, covert.","Arcades and other gaming spaces have a long — and complicated — history in Los Angeles. In 1939, the city banned a wide range of them, including pinball and claw games, declaring them to be nuisances in public spaces. Archival photographs show some games being destroyed by city officials.","It wasn’t until 1974, when the California Supreme Court declared that pinball was more a game of skill than chance, that the prohibition was overturned.","Today, arcades are being squeezed by other pressures. Vintage games can be difficult to maintain and expensive to repair. When a newer game breaks or needs maintenance, arcade owners can often contact the manufacturer and get technical support. For older games, on the other hand, owners are often left troubleshooting via Facebook groups and online forums.","For avid gamers, though, none of those practical concerns matter much. Arcades allow us to dream — but they also place us inside the dream. They bring us out of reality. And lately that appeal feels as powerful as ever.","Franck Bohbot is a photographer based in Los Angeles.

Groups congregate in lawns and fields — and sometimes in the middle of the street. Males puff out their iridescent feathers, fan their tails and drag their wings on the ground in a vie for the right to breed. Their faces and necks turn dazzling shades of blue and red.","Once rare and elusive denizens of America’s woodlands, these heaviest of the galliform birds (chickens and their relatives) have gone urban. Wild turkeys live in the residential neighborhoods around my home in Madison, Wis.","A few years ago, their elaborate courtship displays fascinated me so much that I began to photograph them — and, as I’ve learned, there’s more happening than meets the eye.","For starters, turkeys of a feather flock together. Males, known as toms, can form lifelong flocks with their brothers. Dr. Alan Krakauer, a biologist and fellow photographer, studied this as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He discovered that toms in a flock were anywhere from full to half-siblings. These bands of brothers cooperated to court females, or hens, and chase off competing males.","Remarkably, though, only the dominant male mated and fathered offspring. The subordinate brothers served as “wingmen,” “bodyguards,” or “backup dancers,” to use Dr. Krakauer’s colorful descriptions. “They have what I think of as a support role,” he said.","Despite the potential for lifelong celibacy, wingmen benefited from the arrangement, Dr. Krakauer found — at least by the raw calculus of evolution. On average, dominant males with wingmen produced seven offspring a season, whereas solo males produced fewer than one. Since the males were closely related, those seven offspring contained more of the wingmen’s genes than if they’d sired a single chick themselves.","“They’re helping their brother get a lot more females than either of them would get on their own, so this cooperation seemed particularly helpful,” explained Dr. Krakauer. “That seemed to be surprising for people at the time.”Anyone who’s had a brother knows the vicissitudes of fraternal relations. While brothers generally cooperate during the mating season, intense fighting breaks out at other times, as they jostle for rank. Turkeys have formidable weapons: large bodies, powerful wings and spurred feet. On one occasion, I saw a fight so violent that spittle flew — like when a boxer is hit by a knockout punch.","While males are aggressive with each other, they aren’t aggressive toward females and do not force copulations, despite being twice the size of their mating partners. So while males may strut with abandon, females ultimately choose their mates. They’re picky about partners and know what they want: males with long snoods.","Snoods are the fingerlike fleshy protuberances that flop over a turkey’s beak. The animals can contract and relax muscles and blood vessels in their head and neck, causing changes in the organ’s length and color. A tom sporting a long red snood draws the attention of hens like flies to honey — although, to their credit, the hens manage to be coy about it.","Dr. Richard Buchholz, a professor at the University of Mississippi, has spent his career studying wild turkeys. He examined the role that various male ornaments — including snoods, caruncles (pebble-like bumps on the head and neck), skullcaps (thickened skin on top of the head), spurs (talons on the legs) and beards (tufts of hairlike feathers projecting from the chest) — play in female mate choice. He found that snood length was the primary factor that explained which male a female chose as a mate. Even a few extra millimeters made a difference.","“It did surprise me, especially since the snood doesn’t seem to be a very functional thing to choose,” Dr. Buchholz said. “Why the snood and not all the other ornaments on males?”The answer lies in a phenomenon with deep roots in biology: Fancy accouterments may indicate good genes. For turkeys, a male who can afford to sport a killer snood must have had ample resources, which ostensibly reflects the quality of his DNA. Dr. Buchholz found that males with longer snoods had fewer coccidia parasites, which don’t harm adults but can sicken or kill chicks, and possess genes that may make them resistant to coccidia.","“Early on there’s probably a big impact on chick survival,” Dr. Buchholz said, so by choosing longer-snooded males, females may provide their babies with lifesaving parasite resistance.","Dr. Buchholz is still uncertain about the role some other male ornaments play. Like snoods, other fleshy structures on a turkey’s face and neck can change color during displays. For example, males will drain all the blood from the caruncles so they’re as white as a sheet of paper, Dr. Buchholz said. He remains unsure of what the change in the caruncles might signal, or why it’s important.","And what about those fancy feathers? “I don’t know if females care,” Dr. Buchholz said. The feathers of male turkeys infected with coccidia reflect less ultraviolet light, which turkeys (but not we humans) can see. However, no one has studied whether females scoff at dull feathers the way they do at puny snoods.","There’s still a lot to learn about wild turkey mating behavior. “For a bird that’s such a great conservation success story, that’s so common and interesting to people, and that has a cultural connection to the American Thanksgiving, for us to not know more about its behavior is really a shame,” said Dr. Buchholz.","Perhaps that’s not entirely surprising. Wild turkey populations are currently booming in many parts of the country, thanks to conservation efforts; in places like New England, Madison and Berkeley, they’re now so common that they get about as much notice from passing motorists as a traffic cone.","But that wasn’t always the case. Until recently, wild turkeys were rare in the United States — “which seems crazy now,” Dr. Krakauer said, “since they’re right in town and blocking traffic.”Anne Readel is a photographer, writer, biologist and lawyer.

Cárdenas, our Airbnb host, said with a laugh. “You’ll die in the heat.”She pinched the thick red fabric between her thumb and held it up to my face like a specimen. “You see? Heavy tight dresses like this are made for the festivals at the bullring in Seville city,” she explained. “You need lightweight stretchy polyester for pilgrimages — for riding, walking, dancing, siestas in the grass.”The El Rocío pilgrimage is a high-octane religious spectacle — a multiday annual fiesta, held in Andalusia, the southernmost region in Spain — of flamenco dresses, caravans and religious fervor that seems to grow ever stronger, despite the ever-waning influence of the Catholic Church.","Participants can spend months in preparation: planning menus, hiring tractors, arranging for caravans. It also requires the selection of a dress that permits the wearer to relieve herself behind a bush while exuding all the elegance of Goya’s Duchess of Alba.","Having studied for a year in Seville in 2012, Kevin, my collaborator, has long dreamed of returning to document the pilgrimage of El Rocío, which was canceled for two consecutive years during the pandemic. My connection to Spain is more recent: I moved to Mallorca last year after deciding that life is too short not to live on a Mediterranean island. Kevin and I regularly work together on travel assignments, and when he told me about El Rocío, it was an easy yes, because the best way to get to know a new country is to party with it.","Although we were documenting the 2022 pilgrimage (this year’s will be held at the end of May), we were also participating in a celebration. Andalusia — famed for flamenco dancing, cowboy culture and pilgrimages — has a distinct and seductive identity that people in the south of Spain are rightly proud of.","The El Rocío pilgrimage is arguably the most potent visual representation of Andalusian culture, and it’s this, as much as religious zeal, that propels hundreds of thousands of pilgrims toward the shrine of the Virgin in the village of El Rocío. Some travel on foot, others atop elaborately decorated caravans. Many are on horseback: stiff-backed and spiffily attired riders in wide-brimmed hats, high-waisted paseo trousers and cropped guayabera jackets.","On our first day, Kevin and I wandered through Doñana National Park, some 40 minutes south of central Seville, foraging for the pilgrims we were assured would be there. Eventually we heard the faint tinkle of cowbells, the clap of horses’ hooves, creaking caravan wheels, the strains of flamenco guitar, voices singing in unison. Within minutes, the dusty road had transformed into a festival. Caravans rolled past. Pilgrims pressed bottles of Cruzcampo beer and slices of cured Ibérico ham into our hands. The singing reached a crescendo.","In Spain, Catholicism is taken seriously. But so is beer, ham and cheese — even at 10 a.m.","Many Andalusian cities, towns and villages developed their own pilgrimages — known as romerías, so named because pilgrims traditionally walked to Rome — dedicated to their particular patron saints. But the four-day walk to El Rocío has achieved cult status.","According to legend, a statue of the Virgin Mary was discovered in a tree trunk many hundreds of years ago, in the marshes of the Guadalquivir River. For a couple of centuries, devotion to this shrine was confined to the surrounding towns of Almonte and Villamanrique de la Condesa. But by the 20th century, in celebration of Pentecost, hermandades (brotherhoods) of pilgrims were walking up to four days to get to the area — from the area surrounding Seville and Huelva, and eventually beyond Andalusia, from Madrid, Barcelona and the Balearic and Canary Islands. At night, the hermandades would camp in the forest, dine together at long tables and dance flamenco around campfires until the reality of the next day’s 15-mile hike couldn’t be ignored.","Kevin and I share an obsession with international festivals. His impulse is to capture portraits, mine is to listen and learn. But wherever we go, Kevin and I tend to fixate on the faces.","At El Rocío, no faces were closed to outsiders. We were invited into caravans; told to sit and eat stew and sliced watermelon; dragged into flamenco dances; and instructed to take a siesta after lunch in the grass — otherwise we’d “never survive until Sunday,” one participant told us. No one we encountered was reluctant to be interviewed or photographed. Everyone seemed to accept that El Rocío is a spectacle. Our amazement and curiosity was received as a sign of respect.","We joined the caravans in the muddy waters at Quema, a ford in the Guadiamar River, a tributary of the Guadalquivir. In the town of Villamanrique de la Condesa, every restaurant and bar was spilling over with spectators. (El Rocío is televised like a sporting event throughout Spain.)By Friday night, the first of the hermandades arrived in El Rocío, a tiny town that reminded me of Western movie sets I’ve seen in California and Arizona. Its character is entirely shaped by the pilgrimage; the more prominent hermandades — like Huelva, with its 10,000 pilgrims — own huge boardinghouses at the edge of town, with convent-like rooms and vast communal dining and dancing areas. The smaller hermandades just look for short-term rentals. Even with our beginner’s Spanish, we were ushered inside a whitewashed house and given beer, chunks of manchego cheese and slices of cured ham. It struck me that most Spanish culinary staples are essentially pilgrim food: controlled decay turned into a delicacy.","In El Rocío, we found religious fervor in the streets, in the Churro shacks, in the hermandades themselves. But there was also fervor for fervor itself. I’m the Irish daughter of a Presbyterian pastor, raised on no-frills religious celebrations; tea and a scone is as decadent as Presbyterian celebrations get. In El Rocío, I found myself intoxicated by the pageantry and rituals, and by the idea that a pilgrimage can and should also be a source of revelry.","Friday night melted into Saturday morning, and Kevin and I found ourselves chatting with two young friends from Madrid — in their 30s, like us. Young people used to want to escape from religious traditions, they told us. But El Rocío offers them an escape, they said, from the stresses of modern life.","“I love El Rocío, because it’s the one time of the year that my whole family gets together — no excuses,” said Carmen Mora, 32, who works for a travel tech start-up. “It’s healthy to forget about city life for a week — my city clothes, the technology, my job, the pressure.”“It’s good for the spirit to be immersed in tradition,” she added.","Kevin Faingnaert is a photographer who lives in Ghent, Belgium.

'["\r\n\tThe pandemic’s onset roused people to flock to Miami for the beaches, low taxes, limited public health restrictions and its year-round summery weather. That resettling brought a business boom to South Florida, which included a flurry of restaurant openings and new public art displays. But some locals attribute rising rents to this new migration, and describe sudden changes to the cultural fabric as a “New Yorkification” of Miami. This guide is designed to give you the best of both new and old Miami, with a focus on its Latin American and Caribbean cultures. Here you’ll find a salsa club in Little Havana, interactive art in Allapattah, a rooftop bar with striking views of downtown, and a remarkable meshing of Cuban and American cuisine that defines how this city eats.\r\n"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/23/travel/things-to-do-miami.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/23/multimedia/23hours-miami-lede-tvcw/23hours-miami-lede-tvcw-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-02-23 10:00:04+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:43.933812+00');

Its central “golden triangle of art”(anchored by the Prado, the Reina Sofía and the Thyssen-Bornemisza museums) makes for a dazzling art lovers’ pilgrimage, and the city is bolstered by cutting-edge cultural foundations like Espacio Solo and Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary. In 2023, Madrid is commemorating the 50th anniversary of Pablo Picasso’s death and the 100th anniversary of Joaquín Sorolla’s with a series of exhibitions dedicated to each artist. Also, few cities have seen such a flurry of hotel openings since the pandemic’s onset — including the Edition, the Four Seasons, the Mandarin Oriental and the Hard Rock. One thing that hasn’t changed is the city’s warm embrace of anyone wanting to join the fun.

Fortunately, the city’s splendor — and the irrepressible exuberance of Cariocas, those smiling Rio residents — never went anywhere.\n"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/02/travel/things-to-do-rio-de-janeiro.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/02/multimedia/02hours-Rio-lede-mkfp/02hours-Rio-lede-mkfp-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-03-02 10:00:02+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:44.533794+00');

'By Colleen Creamer', 'travel', '["\r\n\tWithin five years, 200,000 people are expected to move to Nashville, the home of country music and Tennessee’s capital. The city welcomes the business boom, but is also coping with gridlock, an overwhelmed entertainment district and steep rents. Cue emerging neighborhoods like the Nations, Madison and the Buchanan Arts District, which are taking the heat off lower Broadway, the stretch of downtown where the bachelorette parties flock. The city has a thriving L.G.B.T.Q. scene in East Nashville, although the state last week passed a law aimed at curbing public drag performances. Nashville today combines tradition and evolution, where you can visit old-school restaurants and slick cocktail temples, stroll ravishing gardens and trace the impact of Black music at a new interactive museum. Venture into the heart of Broadway, but also take a chance on newer, smaller performance spaces. They’re everywhere. This is Music City.\r\n"]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/09/travel/things-to-do-nashville.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/03/09/multimedia/09hours-nashville-lede-01-lpwm/09hours-nashville-lede-01-lpwm-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-03-09 10:00:02+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:44.833672+00');

Hiking trails abound on all sides of this glittering metropolis and tech hub. Taipei is experiencing a quiet renaissance even amid regional tensions. Young artists, chefs and curators are redefining and embracing Taiwanese identity as its own distinct category, with a conscientious pursuit of food and design endemic to the island’s history. With low crime and brightly lit convenience stores everywhere, the city is safe to meander at all hours. A word of advice: Sleep in.

The sky resonated with the sound of flapping wings, and groups of the birds shrieked and stalked among the shrubs on a rocky beach at Block Island National Wildlife Refuge.","A fuzzy, freckled gull chick emerged from a bayberry bush, stared curiously at me as if it had spotted a Martian, and then waddled back to its hiding place.","It turned out I had stumbled on Rhode Island’s largest gull colony, and the reason so many other sunset watchers had stayed behind in their cars may have been that, as I later learned, the gulls are known to divebomb trespassers.","Preserves make up about 2,500 acres — nearly half — of Block Island, a nine-square-mile, pear-shaped speck of Rhode Island just northeast of Montauk, N.Y. With about 28 miles of trails, these areas provide a haven for numerous endangered animals, and anyone else seeking a little solitude.","On a tiny island whose seasonal population balloons, the preserves are rarely crowded, even in the summer. “Most people go to the beach,” Scott Comings, the associate director for the Nature Conservancy’s Rhode Island chapter, explained matter-of-factly.","The island is small enough that you can easily hit a preserve every day. During my week exploring, I never ran into more than two people at any of them, which enhanced the feeling of being far from civilization although I was never more than a few miles from the center of the island’s only town, New Shoreham.","In addition to the chance that you won’t see another soul there, you also won’t encounter bears or venomous snakes because there are none on Block Island. There also are no coyotes, foxes or raccoons. (Ticks are plentiful, so take proper precautions.) But you will see birds: About 300 species pass through in any given year. Because the island has few predators and sits in the Atlantic Flyway — the north-south migratory route along the East Coast — it is essentially a giant avian playground.","You can get started with programs like nature walks or talks through the Nature Conservancy and the Block Island Conservancy. They’ll orient you to the island’s dunes, waterways, marshes and hundreds of freshwater ponds before setting off on your own, or with your furry friends: Leashed dogs are allowed at many of the preserves.","You can buy a $3 Nature Conservancy trail map from the Chamber of Commerce office near the ferry. The Block Island Chamber of Commerce offers an app with maps.","Block Island isn’t big on signs, and address numbers aren’t sequential, thwarting GPS navigation. Fortunately, cellphone reception is excellent, and the entire island was recently wired for broadband internet service. So make sure your phone is fully charged and you have plenty of water before you set out on your adventure, in case you take a wrong turn and end up logging unplanned mileage, as I did.","The Hodge Family Wildlife Preserve, a 25-acre gem managed by the Nature Conservancy, offers a soothing introduction to Block Island nature with its mile-long, nearly level loop mowed through waving fields of goldenrod. It’s the perfect place to watch the sun set over Middle Pond as a family of swans glides by. The Nature Conservancy recommends Hodge for people with mobility issues and has an all-terrain wheelchair available to lend.","The hardest thing about Hodge is finding it. The Nature Conservancy staff offered the following directions: As you head north, count 10 telephone poles from the transfer station on your left and look for a gap in the stone wall along the road. Drive through the gap and you will see not only the preserve but also an engraving on a large rock announcing you have arrived. When I found it, it felt a little like stepping through the wardrobe to Narnia.","Inside, you might spy characters like a shiny black rhinoceros beetle — one of about five rare beetle species on the island — lumbering across the path; a tiny, adorable meadow vole; or a soaring, majestic northern harrier, a type of raptor.","Like Hodge, the 190-acre Clay Head Preserve is difficult to find, but well worth the effort. A three-and-a-half-mile round-trip out-and-back trail, redolent of honeysuckle, like much of the island, and dotted with pink wild roses and white viburnum, offers views of the ocean and craggy coastline as well as access to the beach, where you can wade and picnic.","The trailhead is just south of Hodge off Corn Neck Road at the end of a 0.3-mile dirt track, where you will see a sign that says Clay Head Nature Trail. In the fall, you might spy some of the 100 or so species of songbirds that stop here to rest and refuel. If you’re feeling brave, you can wander into the section of intertwining paths that locals call the Maze.","Sheer wild beauty is on display at Rodman’s Hollow, a 230-acre basin created by a melting glacier some 22,000 years ago. It is considered the birthplace of the island’s conservation movement: The Block Island Conservancy formed in 1972 to purchase this land from developers. Here, a two-and-a-half-mile loop leads to Black Rock Beach, where the trail suddenly falls away to reveal the surf slapping against jagged bluffs and the vast blue horizon where the ocean and the sky meet. “It’s like being on the coast of Ireland,” said Sarah Greenaway, 48, a special education secretary from Wayland, Mass., who has been spending summers on Block Island for 24 years. “It’s just stunning.”After hugging the oceanfront for a bit, the trail loops back to the parking lot. A search-and-rescue drone flew overhead on my way to the ocean and back to my car. Members of the volunteer fire and rescue department, who were testing the drone, told me visitors commonly get lost on the preserve’s labyrinthine paths.","It’s basically impossible to get lost on the narrow 134-acre Block Island National Wildlife Refuge, which provides a landing strip for songbirds and migrating monarch butterflies.","A 0.7-mile walk from the parking lot to Cow Cove, where the heads of gray seals bob in the surf, will take you to the dunes near Sandy Point. Piping plovers, a federally threatened species, recently started to breed there after an 11-year absence from Block Island, said Maureen Durkin, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge. The tiny chicks “look like a little cotton ball on a stick,” Ms. Durkin said, and many don’t make it to adulthood.","The roughly 800-acre Great Salt Pond isn’t technically a preserve, but it is home to a wide array of water birds and around 100 species of fish. It’s also a popular place to get out on the water. Pond and Beyond Kayak on Ocean Avenue offers ecotours by kayak and paddle board. I opted for the kayak tour, which gave me a close-up view of fiddler crab colonies scuttling around on the beach, egrets wading along the shore and double-crested cormorants standing on rocks to dry their wings in the sun. Once you’ve built up an appetite, jump in line at the Payne’s Killer Donuts truck, also on Ocean Avenue, and grab a few of the warm cinnamon sugar variety.","If you prefer to explore the Great Salt Pond on foot, head to Andy’s Way, a quarter-mile strip of beach where you can spot all manner of crabs — the imposing horseshoe, the leopard-spotted lady, the domed-shell hermit and the feisty fiddler. They scurry around — sideways, of course — on the beach, where they burrow into the sand, and around the salt marshes and tidal pools by the 60-foot-deep pond. If you’ve never seen a translucent baby horseshoe crab the size of a quarter, you’re in for a treat: They seem simultaneously prehistoric and precious.","This is also a great place to spot shorebirds and wading birds like snowy and great egrets, American oystercatchers, willets, and black-crowned and yellow-crowned night herons.","No trip to Block Island is complete without a foray to the nearly 200-foot-high Mohegan Bluffs on the south shore, followed by a climb down the 141-step wooden staircase to the secluded beach below. On a clear day, the view from the top of the staircase stretches to Montauk. You can climb the 52-foot tower at the nearby Southeast Lighthouse for even more breathtaking ocean vistas, including five wind turbines anchored to the seafloor about three miles offshore. In 2016, Block Island became the first American community powered completely by offshore wind turbines. Afterward, treat yourself to a lobster grilled cheese from the Southeast Light Delights truck near the lighthouse.","As I was heading from the lighthouse back to my car, I saw a young man coasting downhill on a bike with his arms held out as if he could have taken wing at any minute. After spending a week immersed in Block Island’s natural beauty, I could see why: I felt like flying, too.","Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

disaster this year, with earthquakes, wildfires and floods razing entire towns and villages, killing residents, and destroying or damaging cultural monuments.","The series of catastrophic events has left many tourists in a conundrum over how to respond. Those already in a country in the wake of a disaster debate whether they should stay or leave. Those with upcoming trips wonder if they should cancel. Can they and the revenue they bring in be of any real help, or will they be a burden? How appropriate is it to let tourism go on while a nation is in a state of collective mourning and rescue efforts are underway?There are no easy answers, travel experts say. Each disaster’s impact is unique, and while travelers are advised to follow the guidance of government officials in the aftermath of such events, local communities don’t always agree on the best course of action. After the Maui wildfires destroyed much of the town of Lahaina in August, killing at least 115 people, residents on the island, which depends on tourist dollars, clashed over the decision to allow tourism to continue while locals grieved for all that was lost.","In Morocco, however, where a powerful 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Atlas Mountains southwest of Marrakesh on Friday, killing thousands, the outlook is more unified. With the high tourism season underway and most of the destruction affecting rural areas far from tourist hot spots, many locals are eager for foreign visitors to keep coming so that they can support the economy and bring in funds for relief efforts.","“After Covid, the abandonment of tourists would be terrible for Marrakesh, where so many resources come from tourism,” said Mouna Anajjar, the editor in chief of I Came for Couscous, a local feature magazine. “Directly or indirectly, all the inhabitants are linked to this resource and would be terribly affected.”Here’s what travelers faced with the prospect of visiting a country where devastation has struck should think about.","Check official government guidance and local media reports to assess the situation on the ground. When the deadly wildfires swept through parts of Maui last month, the local authorities urged tourists to stay home. So far, the Moroccan government hasn’t issued any statements beyond the status of rescue efforts, and the country’s tourism office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The British Foreign Office advised its citizens planning to travel to the country to check with their tour providers about any disruptions.","While the U.S. State Department has not updated its travel advisory to Morocco, it is a good idea to check the website before traveling to any country that has been struck by disaster.","Establish exactly where the disaster hit and which areas have been affected. When Greece was ravaged by wildfires in July and thousands of tourists were evacuated from the islands of Rhodes and Corfu, many tourists canceled their vacations, even those traveling to unaffected areas. The Greek tourism minister issued a response, highlighting that the majority of the country, including parts of the affected islands, remained safe for tourists.","When the earthquake struck Morocco on Friday, it was felt in many popular tourist destinations, including Marrakesh and the towns of Imsouane and Essaouira, but most of the damage is concentrated close to the epicenter in Al Haouz Province. In the immediate aftermath of the quake, most Morocco tours were canceled as operators scrambled to make critical safety assessments, making sure that all their clients and staff were accounted for and that tourists were not hindering rescue efforts.","But now, having established that the damage is localized in rural areas and following government guidance, most tours are up and running with some amended itineraries. Hotels have largely been unaffected, according to Morocco’s hotel association.","“There are areas inside the Marrakesh medina that have been damaged, some historical monuments are closed, but most areas inside the cities are totally OK to be visited,” said Zina Bencheikh, the managing director of Intrepid Travel’s Europe, Middle East and Africa operations, who was born in Marrakesh. “The majority of the country is open, with airports, schools, hotels, shops and restaurants operating as normal under the shock of the incident.”Intrepid Travel had 600 customers in Morocco on the night of the earthquake, and only 17 have cut their trips short. TUI, Europe’s largest travel operator, said that some of its itineraries were under review, but that the majority of its guests had decided to stay on after the company carried out safety inspections and chose to support keeping Morocco open.","When a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey in February, Turkish Airlines, the country’s national carrier, canceled dozens of flights across the country to open up resources for rescue efforts. During the Maui wildfires, airlines also canceled flights to Hawaii so that they could use the planes to fly passengers back to the mainland. Most of West Maui is still closed to tourists but is expected to reopen on Oct. 8.","In Morocco, the hardest-hit areas in the Atlas Mountains are currently cordoned off as rescue efforts are underway, and tourists are not advised to go into those areas. But tourism activities are encouraged in other areas of the country that haven’t been affected.","Hafida Hdoubane, a guide based in Marrakesh who takes visitors on hiking and trekking excursions, urged visitors to come, arguing that the danger from the earthquake had long passed and that the authorities in Marrakesh were carefully cordoning off any buildings showing signs of damage.","She said those who called to cancel their expeditions felt uneasy about vacationing in a country that had just experienced such devastation, but that locals did not share that view. “I think it’s best to come and show that life goes on,” she said. “What a mountain tourist can do to help is come, show that they are here and that they stand in solidarity.”Most locals will not expect you to, but it is important to be receptive and mindful of the mood around you.","In Maui, the sight of tourists sunbathing on the beach as rescue teams searched for survivors outraged grieving residents, setting off a social media campaign calling for them to leave.","“The people of Morocco will say don’t switch Morocco off,” said Ms. Bencheikh of Intrepid Travel.","Ángel Esquinas, the regional director of the Barceló Hotel Group, which has properties in Marrakesh, Casablanca and Fez, said there was no immediate need for tourists to cut their trips short unless they felt it necessary.","“It is absolutely acceptable for tourists to continue with their planned activities, such as going on tours, lounging by the pool or enjoying nightlife. Morocco remains a vibrant and welcoming destination,” he said. “However, we encourage visitors to be mindful of their surroundings and exercise respect for the local communities’ particular circumstances. It’s important to strike a balance between supporting the local economy and not overwhelm the community.”Cassandra Karinsky, a co-founder of Plus-61, a popular restaurant in Marrakesh, said she reopened a day after the earthquake to provide an environment for locals to unite at a difficult time. “We’ve had a lot of cancellations, but we’re coming together now to raise money and support our local communities and it’s starting to get busy again.”She said the mood was more somber than usual and people were still in shock, but that tourists were mindful and respectful of locals.","“People still need to eat, and every day there’s a more optimistic atmosphere to come together to help and move forward,” she said.","Visiting a country can be a big support to disaster relief efforts, as many locals depend on tourism revenue for their livelihoods. In Morocco, tourism accounts for 7.1 percent of the gross domestic product and is a crucial source of income for low- to middle-income families. Many restaurants and hotels have started funding campaigns to help their employees and their families in the most affected areas.","You can donate to some of the aid organizations like the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that are responding to the disaster. And Intrepid Foundation, the travel company’s charity, has begun an earthquake appeal campaign for Morocco to support efforts to provide food, shelter, clean water and medical assistance to local communities.","In Hawaii, the Hawaii Community Foundation continues to run a fund supporting the long-term needs of those affected by the wildfires.","If you are a tourist already in a country that has been hit by a disaster, consider donating blood at blood banks, which are often set up in the aftermath of natural disasters.","“We just came out of a big lunch and saw a blood donation center, and it felt like the right thing to do,” said Tony Osborne, a 52-year-old tennis coach from London who was visiting Marrakesh with his family during the earthquake. “The Moroccans have been so welcoming. I just wish we could do even more to help.”Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.","Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

where planes can fly. Severe weather is the leading cause of air travel disruptions in the United States.","Aviation meteorologists plan for and around difficult conditions, crafting weather forecasts used to determine the nuances of flights, from altitude to optimal routes. They play an essential role in ensuring travelers get to their destinations safely and efficiently.","Several major domestic carriers, including Delta Air Lines, have in-house meteorologists who monitor global weather 24 hours a day. Delta has 28 meteorologists on staff — the largest team of any airline, it declares — who sit in the carrier’s Operations and Customer Center, alongside flight dispatchers, customer service agents and hundreds of other staffers, at its headquarters in Atlanta.","In this cavernous and screen-filled room, Warren Weston, Delta’s lead meteorologist, recently spoke about the importance of data, the difference between surface weather and upper-air hazards, and how even one degree of temperature can change a flight plan. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.","The team provides weather briefings covering Delta’s global operations four times a day.","We write our own forecasts for the 10 main Delta hubs in the United States. One of the things that makes us unique is that we are the sole weather provider for Delta. Sometimes our timing will differ from that of the National Weather Service; we might be calling for a slower changeover from snow to rain, for example. The Weather Service doesn’t have to see the people they write these forecasts for, but we have the flight dispatchers right here.","It’s a 30-hour forecast updated every six hours. I guess the moral of the story is data, data, data. We rely on government and university models, and then proprietary in-house tools.","This is completely different than the forecast that you would see on your smartphone app. It is a special aviation forecast giving the dispatchers and the pilots information about variables like wind speed and direction.","We are in two modes here: surface weather and upper air. Surface conditions are visibility, precipitation and clouds. On the upper-air side, we are mostly watching for turbulence, the primary threat. We’re also looking for volcanic ash (a rock mixture debris released when a volcano erupts), thunderstorms and tropical storms. Occasionally we have ozone issues.","Our goal is to give enough lead time so dispatchers and other decision makers can make proactive operational decisions, rather than waiting for something to happen. On our screens, we can see every Delta flight that’s in the air. I can see their route, where they’re going and exactly which dispatcher is in charge of that flight if we needed to communicate with them.","We update the forecasts hours before flights take off. If anything changes, all we have to do is walk over to the dispatchers to suggest areas to avoid or a different altitude.","We always monitor weather for active flights in the air and adjust our hazard alerts for conditions like turbulence, thunderstorms and volcanic eruptions, based on new data. Dispatchers and pilots can easily reach us mid-flight and we can discuss any weather concerns.","Say Thursday looks like it’s going to be extra active with thunderstorms over the Northeast. At that point, flight dispatchers and customer service agents can start working on a plan, both for the customers and from an operational perspective — considering whether they need to send out alerts to the customers because of severe weather, about thinning the flight schedule to lessen delays. They’ll allow customers more flexibility to change flights.","The Federal Aviation Administration regulations require us to have an alternate airport in case of emergencies like mechanical problems or customer medical crises. So we also write special forecasts for these alternate areas.","It definitely depends on the region, station and season. Atlanta, New York, Florida and the East Coast are prone to severe thunderstorms in the summer that cause disruptions. Similarly, we see winter weather delays and cancellations in places like Detroit, Minneapolis and Salt Lake due to de-icing and ramp/runway conditions.","If you’ve got a thunderstorm over the airport, that will prevent you from landing. That’s probably the main one; another could be thunderstorms en route. That could cause planes to fly a different and longer route.","Then in winter, with freezing precipitation you have to worry about de-icing the airplane and general airport conditions, like whether the snow plows will be able to keep up with the snowfall. This is outside of Delta’s control; you’re acting on something that’s being handled by the airport authority.","There’s so many things that can cause delays, and they all vary based on airline, and they all vary based on city. If we had an inch of snow here in Atlanta, obviously everything comes to a grinding halt. We’re just not equipped to handle that type of stuff.","When it’s really hot, the planes can carry a little bit less weight than they normally would, so that means fewer passengers and less baggage. There are also ramp workers to consider.","Even one degree makes a difference. We know what the problem-points are for all our airports — whether it’s temperatures, thunderstorms or snow on the runway — and for Las Vegas, if it’s hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, every degree over 100 is going to mean about 1,400 pounds off.","Bad weather at another airport can still cause delays for your flight, even if the weather is perfect where you are. Those delays can cascade and cause effects in places where the weather is great.","Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

along southern Albania’s Vjosa River, one of Europe’s last undammed waterways, means traversing a landscape that looks much as it has for centuries. Flowing from Greece’s northwestern border to the Adriatic Sea, the Vjosa rushes into box canyons and gorges formed by steep forests of maples, oaks and firs. Ancient stone bridges connect its banks, spanning turquoise water. Sheep graze the valley floor, and vineyards, family farms, orchards and olive groves intermingle with fields of dandelions and red poppies.","Earlier this year, Albania took a critical step toward preserving this timelessness with the establishment of the Vjosa Wild River National Park, a first in Europe, and a destination included on this year’s 52 Places to Go list. The Albanian government, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, nongovernmental organizations from the Save the Blue Heart of Europe campaign, and the adventure apparel retailer Patagonia worked together to protect Albania’s 120-mile section of the river and its main tributaries. (The 169-mile Vjosa’s source is in Greece’s Pindus Mountains.) After years of protests against mining and dam projects, and support from Leonardo DiCaprio, the park’s designation was a victory.","“Our support for the Vjosa really stepped up when we began partnering with the Albanian government in 2021, to do something that hadn’t been done before,” said Ryan Gellert, Patagonia’s chief executive. According to Mr. Gellert, the plan is for the park to be fully operational, with a visitor center and staff, in 2024.","For both locals and tourists, the park’s designation is a boon, if not a lifeline. Communities have depended on the river since before recorded history. And in a country already renowned for its food, the Vjosa Valley’s terroir sets the bar even higher. Hearty fruits and vegetables, trout, mountain honey, lamb, wine, veal, raki (brandy), cheeses and herbs are in abundance — along with Balkan hospitality.","When I arrived in late April, snow still covered the peaks above the river. I’d come to raft, hike and cycle segments of the new park, which, including Vjosa’s tributaries, safeguards around 250 miles of river and more than 31,000 acres: an ecosystem with around 1,200 species, 15 of which are threatened. I was also there to learn about tourism’s growing influence.","“Ten years ago, everyone was running away from the villages,” Mirela Kumbaro, Albania’s Minister of Tourism and Environment, wrote in an email. “Now we have more and more people who, after emigrating, are returning to their villages to open guesthouses, agritourism and agricultural farms,” she wrote. “I see the future of tourism as friendly with the environment, with people who will value nature as a priceless asset.”The valley bustled with visitors when I made my first stop in the town of Permet, which straddles a bend in the Vjosa about 20 miles from the Greek border. The second annual Vjosa n’Fest, celebrating the river’s culture, was in full swing in the former Ottoman commercial center, called the “City of Roses,” that’s becoming an adventure hub. The festival’s lineup included musical acts, guided hiking, horseback-riding, cycling and rafting.","As evening fell, locals and foreigners in outdoor gear packed the streets, listening to the festival’s headlining ensemble: Sazet e Permetit. With each sultry song — a blend of polyphonic voices, clarinets, violins and accordions — the crowd locked arms to revel under the stars.","The next morning, after a breakfast of traditional gliko — nuts or fruit boiled in sugar water and stored in syrup — and strong stove-cooked coffee, I walked from my guesthouse to the main square’s riverside cafes and shops. Old men played dominoes in front of a produce stand. At the offices of Vjosa Explorer, a company that leads raft tours, I reserved the final spot in a raft of bleary-eyed festival goers.","We were awakened by the cold river, running high with snowmelt, as it snaked between canyon walls. About halfway into the three-hour expedition, we pulled onto a pebbly beach. One of Vjosa Explorer’s owners, Irma Tako, waited on the beach.","“The first time I visited Western Europe and saw fruit so shiny and perfect, I was ashamed of our ugly fruit in Albania,” Ms. Tako said, passing out apples. “Then I ate that shiny fruit and realized it was tasteless. Our fruit in Albania is like the country itself: not polished, but full of flavor.”Behind us, 8,143-foot Maja e Papingut, the highest point in the Nemercka Range, poked through wispy clouds. Locals call the mountain by its mythical name: Maja e Drites or “Peak of Light.”“I really saw my country for the first time when I rafted the Vjosa,” Ms. Tako said, handing me a cup of mountain tea with linden flowers, sage, lemon and honey. “I’m scared of mass tourism. I call Vjosa the queen, and the mountains are her crown. We must show her, and her crown, respect.”On an infrastructural level, Albania is not, as Ms. Tako mentioned, polished. Where this country, especially its remote interior, shines is with local guesthouses, local interactions (yes, accept that glass of raki), and unscripted discovery.","“Because we’re natural hosts and have a varied geography — sea, mountains and rivers like Vjosa — in a small area, the country always exceeds expectations,” Gent Mati, the founder of Outdoor Albania, which has led adventure tours since 1991, told me over the phone.","This combination of hospitality and untapped potential makes the relatively undiscovered Vjosa Valley intoxicating. It also creates fertile conditions for overtourism.","Mass tourism and urbanization is a risk, said Andrej Sovinc, a protected area expert with the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the organization that classified the Vjosa as a national park. “To address this, we are developing a vision for sustainable tourism development in and around the Vjosa W.R.N.P. that puts local people and the conservation of natural and cultural values at the focus.”For the next several days, I stayed at Ferma Albanik, a family-run guesthouse whose owner, Elona Bejo, works with local farmers for ingredients she doesn’t grow herself.","“Farmers here are the caretakers of culture,” said Ms. Bejo, who acts as Albanik’s gardener, concierge, yoga instructor and hiking guide. “It’s important that the families with endurance — those who stayed in the valley instead of leaving — are shown appreciation as the economy shifts to tourism.”My initial hike was a moderate one up to the spring-fed, 65-foot Sopoti Waterfall. The next trek was an hour’s walk south of Permet to the 18th-century Orthodox St. Mary’s Church in the hillside settlement of Leusa. The three-nave, stone-and-brick church, which has an intricately carved wooden iconostasis, is awash with frescoes and murals.","I then met Ms. Bejo, who guided me into the narrow Lengarica Canyon, which cradles the Lengarica River, a Vjosa tributary, and a series of hot springs near the village of Benja. We walked past the Ottoman-era Katiu Bridge that frames the largest of the thermal baths, already crowded. We ambled upstream, in knee-deep water, to more secluded pools. Each of the six sulfur baths has a specific medical benefit. We chose the one for rheumatism and relaxed as a rain shower passed over.","The next day, we made a 45-minute scramble from the riverside town of Kelcyra to the unmarked remains of a 2,400-year-old Illyrian fortress on a ridge overlooking the Vjosa. Hundreds of feet below the ruins, a tour of kayakers — orange boats and red helmets against electric-teal water — paddled through the Kelcyra Gorge. From this strategic vantage, ancient residents once communicated with smoke signals to other outposts, warning of invaders: Greeks, Macedonians, Romans.","Between treks, we walked to villages to visit families who work with Ms. Bejo. In Gostivisht, Flora and Krenar Sali have 150 beehives making honey from mountain flowers called Bedunica. In the village of Peshtan, below the nearly 6,000-foot Mount Golikut, we met Mira Muka, who runs the Bujtina Peshtan guesthouse and camp site. She showed us her collection of weapons from the Vjosa’s Italian-Greek frontline during World War II. “About 10 years ago, 15 people stopped here,” she said. “This year, it will be 1,500. The Vjosa gives us everything: people, fish, water. It is our past and future.”For my last stretch, I hopped on the country’s new, 675-mile UNESCO Cycling Route — part of which rolls through the Vjosa basin to the river’s Adriatic terminus. My ride (around 30 miles per day over three days) began in Gjirokastra, a World Heritage Site inscribed for its “architectural character typical of the Ottoman period.” The town’s slate-roofed buildings are spread along the Drinos River, one of the park’s newly protected tributaries.","The hometown of the author Ismail Kadare and the dictator Enver Hoxha, “Stone City” buzzed with visitors roaming its 13th-century castle and its bazaar’s steep, cobbled streets. In front of the GjiroArt Center, a cooperative of local artisans, I joined a group drinking fire-roasted coffee. “Our idea in Gjirokastra is to show traditions and hospitality matter,” one artist said, filling cups.","The trail continued north along the Drinos, passing the 222-acre Archaeological Park of Antigonea, where stone blocks outline an ancient Greek city. The path followed a state road with rolling climbs and sweeping descents opening into valleys. Sheep glided across green pastures like bleating clouds.","In the city of Tepelena, a 19th-century castle stood guard near the confluence of the Drinos and Vjosa. I stopped at the Lord Byron Guest House, named for the English poet who visited the town in 1809. In the courtyard, surrounded by fruit trees, I sat down for lunch made with ingredients grown on the property’s farm: green salad, grilled peppers and eggplant, pasta with olive oil and garlic.","From here, the route shifted back to the Vjosa, where solitude was broken by villages perched above farmland. Families looked up from work to wave. The course eventually took me past another archaeological treasure, Byllis, and the remains of an Illyrian city.","“Vjosa’s big picture includes the environment, economic growth, and the balance between them,” said Rezarta Bare, a tourism adviser for the German Agency for International Cooperation in Albania, which supported the UNESCO Cycling Route. “The real story, though, is about people. This region’s people are warm and kind, the epitome of southern Albanian hospitality. The Vjosa conversation is important because it sheds light on the vulnerability of people, nature and culture — all intertwined on this untamed river.”The river ended just north of Vlora, the country’s second largest coastal city, founded by Greeks 2,600 years ago. After wrestling traffic here at the beginning of the Albanian Riviera, which is squeezed between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, I rode to the Vjosa-Narta Protected Area.","Covering nearly 50,000 acres between the Vjosa Delta and Narta Lagoon, the bayou-like expanse is heaven for birders; with nearly 200 species, including flamingoes, it’s a critical migratory habitat. It’s also the center of a recent Vjosa controversy as the government has begun constructing a new airport within the protected zone.","Near the mouth of the river, I pedaled past salt flats to Katina Balaj, the Balaj Winery’s restaurant and tasting room, and, with a glass of orange wine, watched the sun settle over the delta.","“In environmental protection, you have to win every day so when you finally have a win that is long lasting, such as the declaration of the Vjosa Wild River National Park, it’s important to pause and feel a moment of hope,” Patagonia’s Ryan Gellert wrote in an email after I finished the journey. “It was an incredible moment for all of us, but we are clear eyed that the work really starts here.”Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

S. dollar and practicing the following strategies to avoid excessive fees.","The primary rule of managing purchases abroad is ensuring you are not using a credit card that charges foreign transaction fees.","“Everything you buy will be 3 percent more expensive if you have a card that doesn’t waive foreign exchange fees,” said Nick Ewen, the director of content at the Points Guy, a travel website that focuses on maximizing credit card benefits.","You don’t need an expensive card with a $500-or-more annual fee to have foreign transaction charges waived. Capital One offers cards with no annual fees or foreign transaction charges. The personal finance website NerdWallet maintains a list of credit cards that don’t charge a fee for foreign transactions.","Credit cards are often safer than cash because fraudulent charges can be disputed. (But given high interest rates, use credit cards only if you regularly pay off the balance in full.)If you are planning on paying primarily with credit, bring a second card as a backup in case the first is lost, stolen or declined.","If you are offered the choice to be charged in U.S. dollars or the local currency, always go with the local option.","“People feel like they’re playing with Monopoly money so they will say yes to the U.S. price because they know what it is, but you should let the credit card company do the conversion,” said Sally French, a travel expert with NerdWallet.","Merchants offering to charge in the local currency or U.S. dollars are engaging in “dynamic currency conversion” or setting their own exchange rate, which is typically worse than the going bank rate. Mr. Ewen of the Points Guy has seen a markup of 3 to 10 percent for paying in dollars.","“The reason you get a favorable exchange rate with a credit card is the issuer is operating at much more scale and they’re able to do a large volume of transactions,” said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, a personal finance site.","Though you may need cash upon arrival in a foreign country to pay for a cab or tip a bellhop, don’t get it at an airport.","“In general, the worst place to exchange currency is, in fact, the airport,” Ms. French said.","She advises ordering a small amount of foreign currency from your bank before you fly. This method may not deliver the best exchange rate, but it usually beats the airport currency desk, Ms. French said.","Other experts recommend holding out for foreign cash until you arrive and can use a local A.T.M., where you will most likely get a better exchange rate.","As with credit cards, if you’re given the option, always choose to have a withdrawal debited in local currencies. Some A.T.M.s will engage in dynamic currency conversion and dispense local currency but debit your account in a U.S. dollar amount; don’t fall for it.","Also, larger hotels will often convert small amounts of money for their guests.","Expect to pay $2 to $6 to use a machine that is out of your bank’s network, plus an additional foreign transaction fee, usually 1 to 3 percent, according to NerdWallet. To avoid excessive fees, limit the number of times you use an A.T.M. by withdrawing larger amounts.","Check with your bank to determine whether it has a reciprocal relationship with a foreign bank that allows you to use its A.T.M.s without incurring out-of-network charges. For example, Bank of America has partnerships with a number of banks in Canada, Europe and the Caribbean, though it generally charges 3 percent of the amount withdrawn as a foreign exchange fee.","Citibank will waive out-of-network A.T.M. fees up to a certain number of monthly transactions, depending on the type of account. Charles Schwab Bank offers a checking account with unlimited A.T.M. fee rebates worldwide. Capital One offers a checking account with fee-free access to more than 70,000 A.T.M.s globally.","Depending on where you’re going, check whether local transit systems accept mobile payments such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, which allow users to store a credit card in a cellphone app for contactless transactions. Transport for London, for example, allows mobile payments and will cap any charges once you’ve reached the price for a day pass.","The systems in Stockholm and Toronto also allow mobile transactions.","In countries like Canada and Australia, local currency commonly comes in high-denomination coins valued at $1 or more. When paying with cash, it’s easy to find your pockets weighted down with coins. Try to spend or donate them abroad, as it is harder to exchange coins for U.S. dollars once you are back stateside. Bank of America, for example, does not accept coins for conversion."]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/travel/foreign-exchange-how-to-get-the-best-rate.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/14/travel/00Travel-101-Foreign-exchange-illo/00Travel-101-Foreign-exchange-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 09:00:50.794+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:48.303777+00');

0.017859702929854393]', 'By Lauren Jackson', 'travel', '["It was near midnight, in a storm, on a dirt road in the middle of Mongolia. Still, the river seemed manageable.","My cousin Cole Paullin and I were searching for a place to camp, and I was exhausted from a long day of fording streams in our rented four-by-four truck.","“Seems fine,” I said. “Go for it.”Cole accelerated and the front tires plunged off an unseen embankment, slamming onto the rocks below. We were perched at a precarious angle, and the front half of the truck was submerged. Water intruded through a crack in the door, lapping onto my feet. I imagined our rental deposit draining downstream.","Drawn by the noise, two young men came over from a nearby tent camp. One waded toward the car into the waist-deep water with a message typed on Google Translate: “This is dangerous.” I was too embarrassed to be scared.","I lent him my rain jacket as he made some calls. Thankfully, there was cellular service. Within an hour, a man with a truck and a tow strap arrived. We reversed at full speed while he accelerated, extricating us from the river.","“That was Disneyland, dude,” said Cole, 27, channeling the slang of his native Los Angeles. “What a ride.”Cole and I live on different continents — he’s in Philadelphia and I’m in London — but once a year, we convene somewhere new for an outdoors trip. This year, we decided to take a weeklong drive across Mongolia.","Over the past decade, millennials like me — those born between roughly 1981 and 1996 — have been seeking out remote places like Mongolia, while other tourists crowd Santorini, the Eiffel Tower and the Colosseum. It may be a reaction to a world that’s increasingly condensed into our phones, where the same few destinations pop up again and again on Instagram grids and travel blogs. What we have gained in accessibility, we have lost in serendipity.","The Mongolian government has been trying to capitalize on this desire for less curated travel. It has invested in a digital marketing campaign targeting people ages 23 to 40. It has also invited social media influencers to come to Mongolia and post videos of the country’s verdant valleys, Caribbean-blue lakes and orange sand dunes. According to a 2019 survey cited by Mongolia’s tourism ministry, 49 percent of visitors to the country were under 40.","Tour operators are catering to this growing interest, helping young people see the Golden Eagle Festival, an annual gathering of nomadic hunters — male and female — and their eagles; join the Mongol Rally, a driving odyssey across Europe and Asia; or ride in the Mongol Derby, a roughly 600-mile horse race.","“The world is getting smaller, and everyone’s looking for the new frontier,” said Sangjay Choegyal, a 36-year-old living in Bali who has visited Mongolia eight times. “The next place is Mongolia.”When Cole and I arrived in Ulaanbaatar, the capital, in late July, the line for foreign arrivals crowded the new immigration hall at the airport.","Olivia Hankel, a 25-year-old woman from Oregon, had come to train for the Mongol Derby. Willie Freimuth, a 28-year-old paleontology student from North Carolina, had returned for a second year to study fossils. And Mr. Choegyal had flown in with friends for a road trip to the Orkhon Valley, a lush expanse of central Mongolia.","“When you talk about a trip to Mongolia, it always fills up pretty quick,” Mr. Choegyal said.","Last year, Mongolia had nearly 250,000 visitors, more than six times as many as the year before, when the country was emerging from pandemic isolation. The majority of those visitors were from nearby countries, including Russia, South Korea and Kazakhstan. But the number of visitors from Europe and the United States rose more than 500 percent between 2021 and 2022.","“I think you can have a much more interesting, transformative and engaging experience in a Mongolian outhouse than you can at the Taj Mahal,” said Tom Morgan, the founder of the Adventurists, a company that hosts extreme trips in the country. And, he advised, “It’s better not to plan.”Cole and I hadn’t planned much. We arrived with only our backpacks and a rental car booking from Sixt — one we weren’t sure was real. Sixt’s Mongolian offices operate by bank transfer, and before we arrived, we had sent more than $2,000 to their account. I worried it could be a scam.","We were relieved when we arrived at Sixt and found it had our booking. Then we got the bad news: A previous group had wrecked the S.U.V. we had requested. A 3,000-mile trip on the country’s many dirt tracks had destroyed the bottom of the car. The agent offered us a Russian-made UAZ pickup truck equipped with a rooftop tent. It didn’t have a stereo and the air-conditioning was a faint stream of hot air, but it was sturdy.","We were lucky to get it. Sixt was almost fully booked — as were other providers in the city.","“We sold out three times this season. So we added more dates,” Max Muench, 31, a co-founder of the travel company Follow the Tracks, said. His company, which started running tours last year, helps clients book cars and gives them tablets loaded with maps they can use to navigate while offline. “Especially now after Covid, people want to feel a sense of freedom again,” he said. “And they’re looking for it in the vast emptiness of Mongolia.”We soon discovered what that emptiness looked like.","Roughly half of the country’s more than 3.2 million people live in the overcrowded capital, a tangle of roads and new high-rises fraying in every direction. But around a quarter of Mongolia remains nomadic, living on the edgeless steppe in gers, round tents made of wood, tarp, and animal skins or fabric. They move with their herds as many as four times a year.","As we drove out of the city, guided by Google Maps, the sky stretched so wide the horizon seemed to curve. A herd of horses gnawed at the grass, swishing their tails at flies. We were seeking out the herd’s distant relatives as we aimed the truck toward Hustai National Park, a refuge for what the Smithsonian calls the last truly wild horses left in the world.","After nearly an hour on a dirt road, we pulled up to a small, dusty entrance gate. I asked the national park manager, Batzaya Batchuluun, if visitors ever had a hard time finding the place. “Most people come with a guide. But young people like you are starting to show up on their own,” he said. “They have phones. They get here eventually.”Mongolia is surprisingly connected. Despite the long stretches between villages, we got cellular internet service on much of our drive (using a Mongolian SIM card). One day as I was watching camels in the desert, I was even able to do something absurd: Try my luck with Ticketmaster for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour tickets. (Like so many others, I was disappointed.)The Mongolian government has been working to expand online access to citizens and tourists. An estimated 84 percent of the country has access to the internet, and gers often have solar panels, keeping each family’s cellphones charged. The government has also been working to pave the roads from Ulaanbaatar to popular destinations.","All that development has allowed young travelers to roam the country more freely, bringing a different kind of nomad to the steppe. The day after our visit to the wild horses, as we explored Genghis Khan’s ancient capital, Karakorum, we met a group of European women, friends from college on a two-week road trip. They, too, chose to eschew a guide and navigate with their phones.","“We didn’t want a trip where everything is organized for you,” Maria Galí Reniu, a 31-year-old from Spain, said. Hanna Winkler, a 30-year-old from Austria, chimed in: “On our own, we can just pull off anywhere we decide is a nice camp spot.”Cole and I also pulled off where we liked. At night, we camped under the Milky Way, arching bright above our rooftop tent. During the day, we made lunch in golden canola fields or next to winding rivers. In Elsen Tasarkhai, a long stretch of sand known as the mini-Gobi Desert, we rode two-humped Bactrian camels.","Halfway through our trip, I persuaded Cole to detour to Tsenkher hot springs, a popular destination for Mongolians. Nearly an hour down a dirt road, we came across a crowd of children, bobbing on horses. Drawing closer, we saw they had numbers pinned to their shirts.","One girl and 41 boys, ages 8 and up, gathered for a race. The families used their cars and motorcycles to herd the horses to the starting line. Parents smiled and motioned for us to follow as they lined up their cars next to the horses. When the horses took off, we did too, speeding across the grass alongside the racers at nearly 50 miles per hour.","Just as the first horse crossed the finish line, it began to hail. What would have been a celebration turned into an exodus. Some of the riders crossed the finish line and then headed straight into the hills, braving pellets of ice.","As we drove on toward the hot springs, torrential rain overpowered the windshield wipers, and we began to slide. We passed Priuses, a favorite car in Mongolia, mired on the roadsides. Each time we forded a swollen river, the water rose closer to the cab, until we got stuck and it finally leaked in.","The storm had also flooded the hot springs. As we shivered in a tepid pool, one English-speaking boy commiserated: “Sorry you missed the hot water.”After days of slow, off-road driving, we finally arrived at sparkling blue Khuvsgul Lake — our final destination. We wanted to spend the night in a ger, so we called Erdenesukh Tserendash, a 43-year-old horse herder who goes by the nickname Umbaa. His number was on Facebook.","Umbaa, his wife and two sons welcomed us into one of his family’s tents, lit by bulbs hooked to car batteries. For dinner, the family served boiled sheep and horse meat on a communal tray with carrots and potatoes. After dinner, they cracked open the bones and sucked out the marrow, and before bed, we sipped tea with yak milk. As I lay there scrolling, in the light of my phone, I noticed something on my face and swatted. It was a spider the size of a quarter.","The next day, Umbaa took us on a full-day horse ride. We cantered across meadows of wildflowers, saw reindeer and climbed a mountain overlooking the lake, lazing in the sun for lunch, an idyllic finale to our journey.","Back in Ulaanbaatar, the wildflowers seemed far away as I stood with the Sixt agent and worried about the truck. Was there any damage from getting stuck in the river? The truck was so covered in mud and dust, it was hard to tell.","I thought back to the wrecked S.U.V. we were originally supposed to rent and braced myself to lose our deposit, more than $1,400. The agent waved away my fears. Everything was fine, he said. Getting stuck was just standard driving in Mongolia.","His shift was over, so he offered us a ride to the airport. We thought we had plenty of time to make it, but the grinding traffic in Ulaanbaatar almost made us miss our flight. It was one last reminder that in Mongolia, little goes as planned.","Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

traveler who prefers the off-season for its more affordable prices and fewer visitors, I try not to fly in July and August, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. I wait until fall when rates for flights and hotels normally plunge and crowds shrink.","Or they used to.","This year, hotels in Florence, Italy, in September were charging close to summer highs. I was priced out of Key West, Fla., in November, a historically slow month. Considering the eco-friendly resort Playa Viva near Zihuatanejo, Mexico, for the first week of December — long a bargain time to travel — I could find only one night available at rates below $500.","What, I wondered, happened to the off-season?“September is the new August,” said Jack Ezon, the founder of Embark Beyond, a high-end travel agency based in New York City, explaining that the frenzy for European travel stretched the calendar. Nearly a third of his clients who regularly travel to the Mediterranean in July and August rescheduled for June, September or October.","“People are making choices to avoid the crowds and the heat,” said Virgi Schiffino Kennedy, the founder of Lux Voyage, a travel agency based in Philadelphia.","“I’m seeing summer rates creeping into shoulder season,” she added, noting that destinations like Santorini and Mykonos in Greece, which peak in July and August, “are now impossible to book in September.”School calendars still largely dictate the biggest peaks in travel annually, but the dips are not as dramatic — in numbers and in rates.","“I think we’re at the beginning of a change,” said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst who runs the firm Atmosphere Research Group based in San Francisco, crediting flexible work schedules for the trend. “Summer will always be peak season, but I think we’ll see more off-peak travel in fall, winter and spring so those valleys may be less deep.”Travel is most certainly back — the World Travel & Tourism Council said the industry will recover 95 percent of 2019 activity this year — but it’s not a replica of prepandemic patterns.","Compared to 2019, global leisure stays were up 12 percent in spring 2023 at more than 230 Sofitel and MGallery hotels. Fall 2022 bookings were up 7 percent for leisure guests compared to the same period prepandemic.","“Booking shoulder season was once travel’s best-kept secret, but more people are catching on to the trend,” said Matt Berna, the president for the Americas of Intrepid Travel, a global tour company. He said fall and spring bookings this year have grown by 56 and 70 percent, respectively, compared to prepandemic business, inspiring the company to increase its departures to meet the demand.","The river cruise line AmaWaterways has done the same, adding new itineraries for November and February.","G Adventures, which offers small-group trips, said bookings by Americans are up 40 percent this year over 2019. When summer trips in Italy sell out, travelers are bound to look deeper into the calendar, said Steve Lima, the vice president of growth for the U.S. and Latin America for G Adventures.","“It’s like Disney’s always busy and there’s no good time, so you just go,” Mr. Lima said.","Katie Parla, a Rome-based cookbook author who guides private food tours, described a pig-in-the-pipeline scenario where travelers who booked a tour for their 35th wedding anniversary weren’t able to take it until their 37th because of travel restrictions and complications over the past few years.","“The high season used to be Easter to October, but this year Rome started to be slammed a full month earlier and my calendar is nearly full through the end of December already, which is very rare,” Ms. Parla said.","The seasonal switch isn’t just a European phenomenon. Apple Leisure Group, which offers value-priced vacation packages in Mexico and the Caribbean, has seen bookings more evenly distributed throughout the year over the past three years. As a result, its prices are more consistent year-round.","In an August report, Kampgrounds of America found 67 percent of campers had changed their travel plans this year because of the weather. Nearly 64 percent of campers who delayed trips planned to take them after Labor Day. The R.V. rental platform RVShare said shoulder season reservations have grown twice as fast as those in their core summer season, which it attributes to flexible work policies and efforts to avoid extreme heat.","Claire Ramsdell, 31, who works nomadically in customer service for an outdoor company and blogs about hiking, spent the summer in Bozeman, Mont., but found it too hot to work from her vehicle, forcing her to rent high-price accommodations with roommates and poor Wi-Fi.","“I’m not sure why I tried to branch out and do such a popular and expensive destination this summer,” she wrote in an email from Colorado where she plans to hike this fall. “I should go back to off-season travel and less-crowded places.”In a recent travel forecast from Expedia, 70 percent of fall travelers are adults without children.","“We have the flexibility to get the cheapest flights and hotels and not wait in line at the Vatican, sweating with the summer crowds,” said Riana Ang-Canning, 31, of Vancouver, Canada, who works in social media and travels off-season with her husband extensively.","Resolving to avoid summer’s high prices and heavy traffic is easier said than done for families with school-age children, but some parents are considering workarounds.","Before the pandemic, Jennifer Glaisek Ferguson, a mother of two children ages 5 and 8 in Weston, Conn., and her family took a midsummer trip to France when it was sweltering, which they vowed not to repeat. The importance of school attendance and keeping up with the curriculum has deterred the family from skipping much school for travel, but she’s open to missing a few days.","“When there’s an opportunity to see something new and different where they can learn, I’m willing to take the hit,” Ms. Ferguson, 53, said.","Ms. Schiffino Kennedy of Lux Voyage said her family clients tend to add a day or two onto long weekends.","“Clients call with their school calendar in front of them looking to make the most of holidays,” she said, noting that she does the same; this Indigenous Peoples’ Day on Oct. 9, she plans to take her 9-year-old daughter out of school a few extra days to take a five-day trip to Sedona, Ariz., and the Grand Canyon.","Misty Belles, the vice president of global public relations at the travel agency consortium Virtuoso, predicted the return of the rule of school may fuel bookings in late spring, just as classes end.","“Normally in Europe, travel doesn’t start until mid-June, but I think we’ll see many trying to get there early before the heat is a factor,” Ms. Belles said.","Business-wise, the erosion of troughs in the booking calendar is intentional. Travel marketers have long pushed “green season,” May through November, in Costa Rica when it’s rainy but lush, and “cabernet season” in Napa Valley, November through April, when things slow down and restaurant reservations at the French Laundry may be easier to nab.","Montreal en Lumière, an annual winter festival, was established 25 years ago as a way to encourage travel to the Canadian city in a slow period. Last year, the 18-day midwinter festival drew nearly 800,000 attendees to its ice rinks and concerts. Participating restaurants were booked to 96 percent capacity.","To encourage off-season visits on Cape Cod, Pelham Hospitality, which operates three hotels, has introduced activities like indoor roller skating. Chatham Bars Inn calls September and October “secret summer” with programming, including dinner at the property’s nearby eight-acre farm.","“As a destination, minimizing occupancy ‘valleys’ is important for maintaining year-round employment to support tourism businesses and a high-quality experience for travelers,” wrote Bill Lewis, the general manager of the Magnolia Hotel & Spa in Victoria, British Columbia, and chair of the Victoria Hotel Association, in an email.","Whether it’s the relative quiet, the deals or the weather, off-season conditions have gained their own renown, said Andrew Loyd, the director of Loyd & Townsend Rose, an agency that specializes in renting castles and estates in Britain and Ireland.","“I don’t believe there is any longer an off-season,” he said, noting that the special light in the winter months draws photographers to Scotland. “I am constantly amazed how busy places are during so-called off-season months and ultimately one realizes, the world is now a very busy place.”Crowd-averse die-hards, like me, will brave Iceland in the snow, despite the dangerous driving, and visit Homer, Alaska, in October when half the shops are closed. I can have things my way: quieter, cheaper, more local.","“My love of off-season travel is rooted in being frugal, but I also cannot do the heat and would rather see the mountains when it’s 30 or 40 degrees rather than 80 or 90,” said Heather Bien, 38, a writer, blogger and marketer based in Washington, D.C., who is planning to stay in a glamping tent in North Carolina in December.","For folks without that kind of fortitude, it’s time to stop thinking about seasons as months and instead as weeks or even days. These micro-shoulders still exist in many places in November — excluding Thanksgiving week — the first few weeks in December and, outside of ski destinations, in January and February.","For best results, go off-peak Monday through Thursday. At Four Sisters Inns, a collection of 17 boutique hotels in California, the lowest rates are available midweek during winter and early spring.","“The new shoulder season in Europe is winter,” said Jonathan Alder, the founder of Jonathan’s Travels, an agency based in Winter Park, Fla. “To be there when it’s 30 to 50 percent cheaper and no crowds, go to Rome in January.”On Lake Como in Northern Italy, the Grand Hotel Tremezzo touts October as an ideal time to visit, when the weather is fair, the crowds disperse and rates are less than half of high season (starting at $825 a night compared to $1,870 in summer). But it’s a short window. The hotel closes for the 2023 season on Nov. 5.","Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

Ellie Duke and Sutton Lynch', 'travel', '["Sutton Lynch rises most days before the sun, arriving at Atlantic Beach in Amagansett, N.Y., for the early-morning calm. It’s the same beach he’s been going to since he was a child, and where he worked as a lifeguard for years as a teenager. Now 23, he spends his mornings surveying the horizon. When he spots activity on the water’s surface, he sends out his drone.","Mr. Lynch has earned a devoted following on Instagram for his remarkable footage of marine life off the coast of the East End of Long Island. Alongside images and videos of humpbacks, hammerheads, dolphins, bluefish and many other species, he writes captions that range from childhood memories and research on the effects of fishing policy to explanations of animal behavior. Across the board, his work exudes a reverence for the ocean and the creatures that call it home.","Mr. Lynch’s followers often express surprise that this abundance of species exists just out of sight. The truth is, the resurgence is fairly new. And so the photographer is documenting a dramatic turning point in the East End’s environmental and cultural history — a renewal of sea life after decades of depletion.","As recently as 10 years ago, a whale or dolphin sighting was an uncommon occurrence on the East End. The overfishing of Atlantic menhaden — a keystone species that is essential to a healthy ecosystem — led to a huge drop in marine life off the coast of Long Island in the latter part of the 20th century. (Bony and oily, menhaden are harvested for their nutrient-rich oil and are rarely eaten by humans; they feed on plankton and algae and serve as prey to dozens of larger animals.)In 2012, in response to menhaden’s numbers having fallen about 90 percent in three decades, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission enacted the first coastwide catch limits on the fish. Populations soon rebounded, improving water quality and bringing more whales, sharks, rays, seals, dolphins and other animals closer to the beach than they’ve been since the middle of the last century.","“It’s very rare that you have a conservation gain that is so visible in such a short time,” said John Gans, a northeast field representative for the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. “And it’s 100 percent attributed to the 2012 catch limits put in place on menhaden.”The return of larger animals that feed on menhaden coincided with Mr. Lynch’s coming-of-age as a photographer. He got his first drone at 17 and began filming from his home shores.","It’s fitting that his career would hinge on a humble fish. In a region, the Hamptons, and on a platform, Instagram, known for exclusivity and superficiality, Mr. Lynch’s work is both accessible and authentic. “There’s nothing pretentious about him,” said Victoria Cooper, an Amagansett resident and a professed superfan, while visiting one of his photography sales this summer. “You can get caught up in being out here; there’s lots of parties and things. I love that Sutton is taking a deeper look behind the scenes of the nature that we’re all part of.”Long Island is particularly vulnerable to global warming, owing to its susceptibility to sea-level rise, the increasing frequency and intensity of storms, and the growing incidence of algal blooms, among other phenomena. (The region recently appeared near the top of a list by Moody’s Analytics of U.S. metro areas that will be worst hit by climate change.)Mr. Lynch is partly motivated by documenting those changes. Some complex combination of frustration and conviction characterizes his — and much of Gen Z’s — attitude. “It’s hard for older generations to understand how we feel,” he said. “My parents’ generation often says, ‘You guys are going to fix this,’” he continued. “But they’re the ones in control, and everything needs to be done now.”But he also sees his art as a kind of longitudinal study of a seascape — a way to track the subtler, and in his view more insidious, changes that happen over years, increments that add up to a transformed ecosystem. If his practice continues for a decade, he said, he’ll have compiled a sizable portfolio of visual information. “Ideally I would love to work with scientists who could study that data,” he said.","Mr. Lynch’s fan base includes not just environmentalists but also artists and fishermen, locals and out-of-towners. “Nobody likes being told what to think,” Mr. Lynch reflected, when asked how he approached the educational aspect of his work. “I don’t want to alienate any of my followers. I just want to give them the facts.” Wary of scare tactics or blame, he chooses instead to appeal to people’s shared admiration for their landscape. “Fear is not helpful, in my opinion,” he said.","And while the recent uptick in shark activity may be cause for concern among beachgoers trying to enjoy a Hamptons getaway, to Mr. Lynch it’s a thrill. In July, after filming spinner sharks, he wrote: “They’re wild animals, and the ocean is their home. They certainly can be frightening, but it’s important to remember that humans pose a much greater threat to them than they do to us.” A great white sighting is at the top of his bucket list. And the East Hampton lifeguards who count on his shark patrol — the city pays him hourly to look for the animals while he’s perusing the coast with his drone — will certainly be grateful for the report if he ever spots one.","Arthur Kopelman, an ecologist and the president of the Coastal Research and Education Society of Long Island, reflected on the value of public environmental education. “It’s critically important,” Dr. Kopelman said, adding that knowledge about their surroundings helps people “become active stakeholders in terms of protecting their coastal ecosystems.” Mr. Lynch is part of that effort, bringing us close to the action and urging his followers to share in his admiration for nature.","Against a backdrop of the stereotypical opulence and excess of the Hamptons, Mr. Lynch’s work is a refreshing reminder of why the New York elite started visiting these now-iconic shores in the first place. Celebrities, tycoons and tenacious weekenders aren’t the only ones flocking to the endless miles of sandy beaches and rolling dunes — a growing society of sea life makes its home here, too, just offshore.","Ellie Duke is a writer and an editor who lives in Springs, N.Y.","Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

amid centuries-old mirrors painted with cherubs, inlaid marble floors and a ceiling so lavish, the table’s surfaces were mirrored to savor the frescoes. The interior designer toasted the new hotel, calling it a temple to “privacy and experience,” which, given all the operatic singing and Aqua Mirabilis-spiced wine, imbued the event with an eerie Fidelio-is-the-password vibe.","Essentially a super-deluxe annex to the already super-deluxe Hotel Vilòn across a private garden, the Palazzo Vilòn sits at the tip of the long harpsichord-shaped Palazzo Borghese that curves between the Tiber River and the Via del Corso. It has a swimming pool, private disco club and sumptuous living rooms named after Roman gods. Its three spectacular bedrooms, one in a former chapel under a cupola, is imagined, the hotel managers say, as a Roman refuge for Arab sheikhs, Harry and Meghan, and Hollywood royalty.","But when the actors Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz tried to stay here for a recent extended visit, Claudio Ceccherelli, the chief executive of the Shedir Collection, which runs the Palazzo Vilòn, said, the asking price had too many zeros for 007.","“Didn’t offer enough money,” he said.","The whole place cost an average of 25,000 euros — nearly $27,000 — a night. (Laura Symons, a publicist for Mr. Craig, declined to comment.)It’s not even the highest rate on the block. Just down the Via di Ripetta, in the heart of Rome, the freshly unveiled Bulgari Hotel Roma, with hallways showcasing jewels, has a premier one-bedroom suite overlooking the Mausoleum of Augustus. It costs 38,000 euros, or about $41,000, a night.","Rome, a city striated with epochs and contradictions, has always been a mix of the highest and the lowest, emperors and slaves, nobles and knife-wielding thieves, decadent do-nothings and hard-working stiffs. Even so, there is something particularly surreal about the current moment, when the city is becoming increasingly awash in exorbitant hotel options even as it feels the grip of what Romans call the degrado, or degradation, a more than 15-year slide into an often anarchic and acrid state of abandon.","In the spring, riotous vegetation bordering the sidewalks can reach Jurassic proportions. In the summer, garbage bakes in overflowing dumpsters. Throughout the year, fluorescent orange construction fencing is wrapped around seemingly everything. In the June days that marked the opening of the grand hotels, an illegally dumped and busted industrial refrigerator just down the street from the hotels sparkled in the broad daylight. The latest addition to the Roman purgatory is stalled traffic caused by the extension of a subway line that many Romans doubt will ever function, and is more of a profound joke than an underground public service.","Amid all the headaches, the heady talk of a luxury revolution is running up against that entrenched Roman skepticism, engineered over the centuries to avoid getting worked up about promised transformations and to soften the inevitable let down.","Instead, many Romans are wondering if the investors in these new superluxury projects — the Six Senses, the Four Seasons, Rosewood, Nobu, Edition, Hotel Vilón, Maalot and others — are wearing rose-tinted glasses. Or has everyone lost their sense of smell? Has everyone lost their minds?Rome’s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, says the hoteliers are perfectly sane, and know a future good thing when they see it. He points to better restaurants, restored museums, new ones in the works. Post-pandemic tourists have made Rome a prime destination, though he allows that the spritz-thirsty hordes settling in Airbnbs are a threat to the city’s soul.","Further ahead, Mr. Gualtieri envisions a clean, modern, functioning city, helped along by billions in European Union recovery funds, hundreds of millions more for the church’s upcoming Jubilee in 2025 and his own urban renewal policies, including building a garbage incinerator, repairing Rome’s roads, reworking contracts to actually cut the city’s grass, and yes, extending a subway line. The luxury hotels, he suggested, can see around the decrepit corner to a new Roman renaissance.","“Rome was dramatically missing the same hospitality level of a city like Paris,” Jean-Christophe Babin, the chief executive of Bulgari, said at the sumptuous Bulgari bar, upstairs from an entrance adorned with an actual ancient statue of Augustus. The influx of luxury would help “reposition the city, not only as an open-air museum of the past, but as a city of the future,” Mr. Babin said.","The luxury stampede suggests the hoteliers see Rome as a city where money can be made, and where the conditions, if not the garbage and traffic and often world-weary attitude, are suddenly in their favor.","Mr. Ceccherelli, of the Shedir Collection, said top hotels had been eager to come here for ages, but that local interests had helped block new hotels with more than 30 rooms, keeping the big luxury chains out. The mayor’s office said that a 2008 rule prevented the conversion of medieval or Renaissance palaces into hotels hosting more than 60 people (which usually turns out to be about 30 rooms), but that the city had granted concessions to attract higher quality hotels where richer people can spend more money.","And several of the new hotels have set up shop near the Via Veneto in younger buildings that aren’t subject to the rule’s restrictions. Bulgari, despite being in the old center, inhabits a converted Fascist-era government building.","Mr. Babin, who noted that Rome’s tight real estate market was finally loosening up, said that “rich, aristocratic Roman families own most of the city.” Extremely low property taxes, reflecting land registry values, which are a fraction of market values, lead to “a lot of palaces, even if they’re empty, that people will never relinquish.”But tough times for the noble landlord set had helped pry some of those properties loose. And Rome being “a bit abandoned” meant “assets were depreciated,” Mayor Gualtieri said, attracting investors who swooped in, because, compared to other European cultural meccas, Rome is pretty cheap.","But even some of the luxury designers doubt the new hotels will transform an ancient city where the residents often talk of change as if it were a sucker’s pipe dream, and treat new fads and trends as invading armies to wait out.","“The problem,” said Giampiero Panepinto, the Milan-based architect who had toasted Palazzo Vilòn, “is the Romans.”But former mayors say change can happen, and that Romans just needed to see proof to get behind it.","Walter Veltroni, who was mayor during an upswing in the early 2000s, recalled how Romans embraced the ambitious vision that he and his predecessor, Francesco Rutelli, had laid out for the city, with new infrastructure and museums that showed “beauty didn’t end with the Renaissance.”The current mayor, Mr. Gualtieri, said it was now up to him to imbue the city with that confidence.","“The last thing you have to do is to blame your citizens,” he said. But he acknowledged that Romans “feel justified” in behaving in a way that made the city even harder to live in because they are surrounded by inefficiency and lack of public services. He said he needed to break what he called “a vicious circle” and show concrete improvements.","Five-star luxury hotels that most Romans will never set foot in is an unexpected place to look. But optimists say it could be the indicator they are waiting for.","In June, a few days after the Palazzo Vilón showed off its treasures, Bulgari, the Roman jeweler to the stars and hotelier to the super rich, opened its new hotel. It has terrazzo floors and mosaic bathroom walls, both hand-cut and hand-glued. Its assortment of colored marbles evokes Bulgari jewels and the long, sticky reach of the Roman Empire. Over-the-top necklaces once worn by the Astors and Elizabeth Taylor decorate the hallways. By the pool, a statue in a shimmering alcove hushes noisy bathers with an index finger.","“I really hope that this place will become for the next centuries a place loved by the Romans,” said Roberto Mariani, the Bulgari hotel’s project manager and designer, as he showed me around. He added that it was designed as a destination for locals, like himself, and not as a “ghetto for the rich.”Its opening party was the hottest ticket in town. Hollywood and Italian celebrities, brand ambassadors, politicians and influencers sipped from rivers of Champagne on the rooftop. They enjoyed a light show in which drones spelled out “Roma,” and formed items like a blingy ring that looked not unlike a floating diaper.","Mr. Rutelli, the former mayor during the golden age, was there and pointed out the major projects he initiated, including the adjacent Ara Pacis, an Augustinian shrine to the Pax Romana, in a modern museum building designed by the American architect Richard Meier that he pushed to be built against enormous opposition.","“When I became the mayor, the city was, they said, in decline,” said Mr. Rutelli, who served from 1993 to 2001. Around him, decked-out revelers spoke about the dawn of a new Dolce Vita era in Rome, prompting some Romans to suggest the bubbly had gone to their heads.","But Mr. Rutelli insisted that Romans weren’t constitutionally opposed to change and progress. It just required work.","On the eve of the hotel’s official opening, Mr. Mariani showed off the over-the-top touches in the 38,000-euro suite, which he said was “conceived to give the guest the feeling of being an emperor for a night.” The room’s 10 windows looked down on the real emperor’s mausoleum. But that landmark was surrounded by a deep ditch filled with orange fencing and languishing construction workers in the future — perhaps distant future — site of a modern promenade.","The project, Mr. Mariani said, “dates back to 2006.” Asked when he expected the work to be completed, his Roman character emerged.","“As soon as possible,” he said. “I hope.”Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

Now taking their place in the canon is the “girlie” — the tongue-in-cheek sobriquet used by so many young women chronicling their lives online. The summer that just blazed by belonged unequivocally to the girls and girlies, cultural archetypes who embodied, in their despondency and their delight, the incongruities of being young and female in America. Unlike the always-hustling girlboss, the girlies do not dream of labor. They pick at “girl dinners,” go on “hot-girl walks” or rot in bed with Sylvia Plath and Ottessa Moshfegh paperbacks. On TikTok, the incubator from which new varieties of “girl” emerge daily, they sort themselves into “city girls” (who know that romance is a game and make their peace with its cruelty) or “lover girls” (who are destined for eternal heartache but won’t let that deter them from searching for love). Their shared vision of tortured femininity and undefinable malaise is not constrained by age. You can be in your 20s or 30s and still very much one of the “girls.”Given that I myself am an extremely online woman in my 30s and thus the target audience for all forms of girl-discourse, it was predictable enough that I would find myself deeply moved by the most girl-coded movie I watched this summer. But that film was not “Barbie,” Greta Gerwig’s cinematic testament to the conundrums of womanhood. It was the other blockbuster released on the same July day: “Oppenheimer,” the three-hour Glum Nerd in Suspenders Destroying the World film that has been criticized for, supposedly, glorifying an oblivious white man who talks too much about the superiority of science and his intellect while building a weapon meant to cause mass death.","I have now been to the theater four times to watch J. Robert Oppenheimer manufacture and then wallow in his own unhappiness, and at some point along the way, I came to realize that this film is, as they say, “for the girlies.” At first, this was simply a private joke I enjoyed making to myself, counting up all the parallels between this midcentury scientist and the types of young women who treat Instagram stories like a literary medium. He is nicknamed Oppie. He reads metaphysical poetry. He wears impeccably tailored pants with fancy belt buckles and flirts with the unshakable confidence of a city girl who has never known rejection. (Misquoting Marx, being corrected and then smirk-shrugging, “Sorry, I read it in the original German” is, I’m afraid, peak hot-girl behavior.) Played by a cadaverous Cillian Murphy — who supposedly girl-dinnered on something like one almond each night to achieve optimum hollow-cheekboned haggardness — Oppenheimer first appears as he’s being mildly disciplined by a physics professor at Cambridge, to which he retaliates by trying to poison his professor’s apple with cyanide. Movie-Oppenheimer’s great malaise, we’re shown — between shots of him lying listlessly in his dormitory bed — is the burden of his own brilliance, lessened only as he coasts through the halls of great universities to finally find, in quantum physics, the challenge that all-consuming brilliance so desperately craves. His hero’s journey will eventually lead him to the building of the atomic bomb in New Mexico and the cover of Time magazine, though he will also find time to cheat on his wife and conduct a rather calisthenic sex life. From afar, the film has all the makings of a Bildungsroman, the coming-of-age form that depicts a passage from callow youth into maturity. But in Oppenheimer’s case, age arrived long before wisdom. A story by Murray Kempton in the December 1983 issue of Esquire describes how the real Oppenheimer was, as a precocious young man, so blessedly sheltered from the demands of real life — “protected from the routine troubles, discontents and worries that instruct even while they are cankering ordinary persons” — that he was “transported to his glittering summit innocent of all the traps that every other man of affairs has grown used to well before he is 42 years old.” It is only when Oppenheimer is already middle-aged, a man whose faith has only ever been in his own intelligence, that he gets his first reality check, at the hands of a once-adoring government bureaucrat named Lewis Strauss. This is an experience any self-identifying girlie will recognize: a profound betrayal from a friend-turned-frenemy.","Here the girlhood parallels move beyond the facetious to acquire a darker quality, as shame begins to erode Oppenheimer’s sense of self. As he’s accused of being a Communist sympathizer and publicly ridiculed in a kangaroo trial, the once-venerated scientist finds each of his beliefs collapsing. The great Oppenheimer realizes that no amount of personal brilliance can counter the force of the state. He finally sees that he has devoted his intellect to a system that was rigged against him, one that took advantage of his brilliance and then punished him for it. The same man who once earnestly referred to himself as a prophet is now paralyzed by his inability to either have or act on any firm conviction; the veneer of his certainty in his own power has been stripped away. Near the film’s end, Oppenheimer silently reckons with visions of what his brilliance has wrought: unimaginable suffering and fire as the invention he fathered wipes out civilization itself. Even on my fourth viewing, the sight of Murphy’s frosty blue stare elicited in me a deep familiarity, making me recall a line from Annie Ernaux’s “A Girl’s Story”: “To have received the key to understanding shame does not give the power to erase it.” In theory, I have little in common with this man. But shame — living with it, drowning in reminders of it, never being free from your own inadequacy and failure — is a great equalizer. Being plagued by the squandering of your abilities, condemned to a lifetime of uncertainty, forever wondering where you went wrong or whether you were always set up to go wrong. This is the precondition of girlhood that “Barbie” tried to portray — the dual shock and dissonance of navigating a world that seems to vilify your existence, imbuing it with persistent and haunting shame while also demanding that you put on a show for the hecklers. But it was while watching a helpless Oppenheimer, stunned at being forced to participate in his own public degradation by the U.S. government, that I averted my eyes in dread and recognition. For a Great Man like him, it took the twin shames of the bomb’s destruction and public disgrace to have this life-altering yet basic realization about his own powerlessness. But this feeling of betrayal at the hands of the same system that once adulated you is not solely the domain of men who reach a certain age and come to the uncomfortable realization that after a lifetime of revolving around them, the world is now moving on, indifferent or even hostile to their existence. This is a rule and a warning that life has drilled into girls from age 13, if not sooner. The same powers that have displayed you like a trophy will not hesitate to spit you out the moment you have ceased to be useful.","Oppie needed greatness to understand that. But the girlies? We have always known.","Iva Dixit is a staff editor for the magazine. She last wrote a profile of the Jamaican dancehall star Sean Paul.

'By Hannah Dreier and Meridith Kohut', 'entertainment', '["Late on a Thursday in February 2022, Marcos Cux, who had just turned 14, bundled up in green rubberized overalls and a matching jacket that was too big for his slight shoulders. He packed a pair of steel-toed rubber boots and two layers of gloves, because even a small tear could lead to a chemical burn. As others in the house slept, a cousin drove him to his cleaning shift at the chicken slaughterhouse, a half-mile-long industrial complex on a stretch of bare highway in rural Virginia, set behind hedges and a tall metal fence. The plant, which is run by Perdue Farms, processes 1.5 million chickens a week. Before dawn each morning, trucks haul in birds stuffed so tightly in layers of steel cages that they cannot move. Seagulls wheel around above, drawn by scraps in dumpsters. Workers inside hang the birds upside down in a darkened kill room. Bursts of electricity stun them, and the conveyor line runs their necks past sharp blades. They pass through the defeathering room, where the line plunges into foamy hot water, and then on to other machines that remove feet, heads and guts. Finally, rows of workers slice what remains into packageable parts. When Marcos and the rest of the cleaning crew got there after midnight, the plant had a putrid smell workers sometimes felt they could taste. They sloshed through water, grease and blood, which drained into a channel that snakes around the plant under grates. Marcos gathered up chicken pieces left by the day shifts, working quickly because the whole facility had to be sanitized by 5 a.m. He took the covers off the channel and began using a pressurized hose to spray the machines down with 130-degree water. He came from a village in Guatemala to this small town on the Eastern Shore of Virginia several months earlier. Before he left, his family was struggling to pay for electricity and skipping meals in the aftermath of the pandemic. They couldn’t afford formula for his infant sister. His parents were growing desperate and knew that while adults who arrive at the U.S. border are generally turned back, minors traveling by themselves are allowed in. The policy dates back to a 2008 law intended to protect children who might otherwise come to harm on their own in Mexican border towns. In the 15 years since, the carveout has become widely known in Central America, where it shapes the calculations of destitute families. Marcos’s parents decided he would go north and find a way to earn money. They borrowed against their land to pay a coyote — technically a human smuggler, but in this case, more like a travel agent — to help him reach the United States without being kidnapped or hurt. He made his way to an adult cousin in Parksley, a town of 800 people bookended by the Perdue plant and another sprawling chicken operation run by Tyson Foods. His cousin, Antonia de Calmo, was living in an already-cramped home with her husband and four children in a trailer park called Dreamland, but she agreed to take in Marcos after his mother called in tears and said that they had no other options. Federal law bans minors from cleaning slaughterhouses because of the risk of injury. But with the help of a middle-school classmate who already worked at the plant, Marcos bought fake documents that said he was a man with a different name in his 20s. When he was hired, children made up as much as a third of the overnight cleaning crew at the Perdue plant, workers told me. The work was harder than Marcos expected, but it also paid better than he could have imagined — around $100 for each six-hour shift, more than he could make in a month back home. After he finished hosing down the machines, he started scrubbing blood and fat off the steel parts with chemicals that, if they hit skin, created welts that could take months to heal. Shortly after 2:30 a.m., he thought he saw a bit of torn rubber glove within the conveyor belt of the deboning area and reached in to grab it. Suddenly, the machine came to life. Across the factory, another worker had failed to see Marcos crouched with his left arm deep inside the assembly line and turned it on.","The belt caught the sleeve of Marcos’s baggy jacket and pulled him across the floor. Hard plastic teeth ripped through his muscles, tearing open his forearm down to the bone. By the time someone heard his screams and shut off the power, his arm was limp, a deep triangular gash running down the length of it. A rope of white tendons hung from his elbow to his wrist, horrifying the workers who gathered around him. He understood from their faces that something was badly wrong but didn’t feel any pain as the wound began gushing blood and he started to lose consciousness.","A supervisor called 911 to report the injury. “We don’t know what to do,” she said, her voice rising. “It’s bleeding out.” The dispatcher ran through a list of questions about his condition. “And how old is that person?” the dispatcher asked.","The supervisor did not respond.","“Even if you had to guess?” he asked.","Still no response.","“Like, 20s? 30s?” he asked.","“Um,” the supervisor said, her voice shaking.","Another moment passed, and the line went dead. When the paramedics arrived, a dispatcher reported “massive amounts of bleeding,” and Marcos was flown to a trauma unit in Baltimore for emergency surgery. He lay in the hospital for two weeks as medical staff wondered why the paperwork for this boy with long eyelashes and a round baby face said he was an adult man named Francisco. The morning after Marcos’s injury, workers in Dreamland began talking about a child whose arm had been nearly torn off at the plant. Word soon spread through town. There were reasons that supervisors, teachers, federal inspectors and even police officers had said nothing for years about children working at the slaughterhouses. Everyone understood that the children were under extraordinary pressure to earn money to pay off their travel debts and help their families back home. They were living on a remote stretch of peninsula with few job options — if the plants shut down because of a labor scandal, the local economy could collapse. Now, with an eighth grader in the hospital, many wondered if they had been wrong to keep quiet.","For most of the last century, Parksley was an almost entirely white agricultural community, with a migrant labor force that cycled in and out with the rhythms of the tomato and corn crops. That started to shift when the two plants opened in the 1970s, just as American consumers were developing an appetite for boneless, skinless, nugget-size chicken. More processing steps required more workers, and the companies, which now produce one in three pounds of poultry consumed in the United States, became the area’s biggest employers. It was dangerous, grueling work, and half the plant employees quit each year. The managers found a solution to chronic turnover by looking to migrant seasonal workers, who now settled in Parksley and other nearby towns in Accomack County and worked year-round at the plants. In recent years, poverty worsened in Central America, and the work force changed once again. More than 300,000 migrant children have entered the United States on their own since 2021, by far the largest such influx in memory. Most have ended up working full time, fueling a resurgence in child labor not seen in a century, with children living far from their parents and working illegally in all 50 states. At slaughterhouses, it is no longer only Spanish-speaking adults seeking jobs but also children, most of them from Guatemala, which is one of the most impoverished countries in the region.","The pandemic was especially crushing to the agricultural highlands where Marcos’s family raised animals on a small plot of land. The odd jobs that kept them afloat disappeared during the shutdowns, food prices soared and then his father fell ill. When his parents told him he would be going to the United States to work, he was initially excited — he pictured a land of skyscrapers and shopping malls.","After crossing the border, Marcos spent a few weeks in a shelter run by the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency is responsible for releasing migrant children to adults who will protect them from exploitation while their cases move through the immigration system, a process that takes years. So many children were crossing in the early days of the Biden administration that the shelters filled up, and children were sometimes held at jail-like facilities run by Customs and Border Protection. H.H.S. urged shelter workers to send children to their sponsors more quickly.","Children usually arrive in the United States with some idea of who might take them in: either a parent or sibling or, about half the time, a more distant relative or family friend. While parents and siblings often support the children who come to live with them, other adults are more likely to take children in only on the condition that they work and pay rent. Of the dozens of children who have been released to sponsors in and around Parksley during the past three years, more than 90 percent have gone to adults who are not their parents. Marcos gave the shelter staff Antonia’s phone number, and the agency contacted her and sent a list of requirements for sponsors. The first was to provide Marcos with food and shelter. Another was to send him to school. Nearly last on the list was a pledge that he wouldn’t work. Antonia agreed to them all, but she had no intention of keeping Marcos from working. She knew that was why he had come. She, her husband, her oldest daughter and most people she knew worked for the chicken plants, and it seemed likely that he would find a job there, too. Marcos and Antonia said H.H.S. officials never came to check up on him after he arrived in Virginia. But they decided to enroll him in school anyway, just in case. “I had to go to school, but I only came to help my family,” he told me in one of many conversations in Spanish during the past year. Marcos began attending eighth grade in the Accomack school district, where more than 1,000 of the county’s roughly 4,700 students were learning to speak English. Marcos borrowed $800 from Antonia to buy fake papers from a man in a nearby trailer, and at 13 he was hired onto the overnight sanitation shift. Each morning, Antonia picked him up from the plant at 6:30, and 20 minutes later, he was waiting in front of Dreamland for the school bus. While teenagers work legally all over America, Marcos’s job was strictly off limits. Federal law prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from working at night or for more than three hours on school days. Older teenagers are allowed to put in longer hours, but all minors are barred from the most dangerous occupations, including digging trenches, repairing roofs and cleaning slaughterhouses. But as more children come to the United States to help their families, more are ending up in these plants. Throughout the company towns that stud the “broiler belt,” which stretches from Delaware to East Texas, many have suffered brutal consequences. A Guatemalan eighth grader was killed on the cleaning shift at a Mar-Jac plant in Mississippi in July; a federal investigation had found migrant children working illegally at the company a few years earlier. A 14-year-old was hospitalized in Alabama after being overworked at a chicken operation there. A 17-year-old in Ohio had his leg torn off at the knee while cleaning a Case Farms plant. Another child lost a hand in a meat grinder at a Michigan operation. In Accomack, cleaning staffs once worked directly for the slaughterhouses. But years ago, the plants started delegating this work to outside sanitation companies, which pay less and allow brands to avoid accountability for problems. The largest such U.S. contractor, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., says on its website that it can “take the liability and risk off your facility’s record.” The Biden administration has pledged to start fining brands for violating child-labor laws, but so far it has imposed penalties only on subcontractors. A 2022 study led by a researcher at Washington State University found that many adult workers would be willing to take meatpacking jobs if they paid slightly better, around $2.85 more an hour. But in Parksley, the only people eager to join the poorly paid night shift were immigrant women who wanted to be available to their kids when they got home from school. When children like Marcos began to arrive, far from their parents and under pressure to make money, there seemed to be a perfect match between the needs of the plants and the needs of the newcomers. “They have to work,” says Miguel Cobo, assistant manager of the sanitation shift at Perdue. And the plants need people to clean. “If companies like this looked too closely at who was working, no company would be able to keep going.” Cobo and the other supervisors had agreed to let the children leave early so they could get to homeroom. “It’s a circle — they help us, and we help them.”Marcos woke up alone in a hospital room in a tangle of intravenous tubing and beeping machines. He knew that children were not supposed to work at the plant, and now he understood why. But he worried about what his parents would do if he didn’t recover — they still owed more than $6,000 for his journey north. He believed he had to get better and persuade the bosses to hire him back. Doctors were able to save Marcos’s arm, and with two more surgeries and six months of physical therapy, he started to be able to move it again. But skin grafts from his thigh gave his forearm an uneven, quilted appearance, and his fingers were still frozen in a claw. Fayette Industrial, the Tennessee-based cleaning company that had been hired by Perdue, covered his medical bills.","One afternoon last September, a few weeks after his third surgery, he stood on his porch with Antonia and looked out over Dreamland, wondering how things had gone so wrong. “It’s really not how I thought it would be,” he said. Built in the 1970s, the trailer park is now entirely Spanish-speaking and has effectively become company housing for slaughterhouse workers. Green jackets used by the cleaning crews hang from porches and clotheslines, and residents leave hard hats with sanitation-company logos outside their doors. The plants in Accomack County are not just the area’s primary employers; they are major supporters of the community. Children go to school with backpacks donated by Perdue and study in math-and-science centers funded by the company. Tyson gives thousands of pounds of chicken and dry goods to first responders and food banks that families rely on as nearly one in three children in the community live in poverty. Perdue buys trucks for the volunteer Fire Department and donates hundreds of whole chickens to its cookout fund-raisers. When Parksley got its first library this summer, the Perdue Children’s Room was its centerpiece. Almost all the Dreamland families are originally from Mexico or Central America, but the park offers two kinds of childhoods. Some children hurry home from school, eat a rushed dinner and then go to sleep as early as possible so they can get up for work. Others, mostly children living with their parents, spend the hours after school hanging around outside their trailers, playing on rope swings or splayed on couches they drag onto lawns. Several have part-time jobs cutting grass or babysitting. But if they work, it’s not to pay debts or help with rent. Their parents take care of that and admonish them to finish their homework so they will not end up at Tyson or Perdue. Seven months after his accident, Marcos had become a rarity in the community: a 14-year-old living far from his parents but not working. “They won’t take me back because of the accident,” he said of the sanitation company. He still couldn’t lift his arm well, and often it hung limp at his side. It was approaching 90 degrees, but he wore long sleeves to hide his scars.","After his injury, Marcos missed a month of eighth grade. Students who had been on the shift told their teachers what happened, but when a school counselor called Antonia, she said Marcos had fallen at home. “I was nervous to say anything more because of his age,” she said. She refused to show school administrators Marcos’s medical records. They were under his false name, which Dreamland residents who use fake papers because they are underage or undocumented tend to call their “stage name.”Marcos thought about returning home. “I came only because things were so desperate,” he said. But if he went back, there would be no way to pay off his family’s debt, and they would lose their land. So he returned to school instead. He started paying closer attention in class and studying English at night. Many Dreamland children drop out between middle school and high school, but to his own surprise, Marcos was now in his first weeks of ninth grade. He felt guilty, but Antonia understood the bind he was in. “He wanted to help his mom and dad, but he can’t do anything now,” she said. “And once you come, you can’t go back because of the debt.” As Marcos and Antonia talked, they looked over at the neatly painted trailer where Cobo, the assistant manager at Perdue, lived. Two nights earlier, he was on duty when a young woman got her leg jammed in a pallet jack and had to be taken out in an ambulance. He was also working the night Marcos was injured and had taken a photo of the boy’s mangled arm to show the other shifts as a warning. He felt pity when he saw Marcos now. He had sponsored a young relative who worked nights at the plant while attending school, and he understood the strain the children were under. He had not said anything about Marcos’s age to the bosses because he didn’t want to cause problems for the other young workers. After Marcos’s injury, the priest at the Catholic church near Dreamland announced a collection for him during Mass. He knew that many children in the congregation worked overnight but didn’t see his role as extending beyond bearing witness. A police officer who coached softball at the high school discussed the accident with a teacher but didn’t get involved; it didn’t seem like a law-enforcement matter.","Short of someone calling in a tip, the Department of Labor, which is in charge of enforcing federal child-labor laws, was unlikely to find out what had happened. The department has 750 investigators overseeing fair labor standards at 11 million workplaces, including 3,000 slaughterhouses. Even when inspectors do catch child-labor violations, the maximum penalty per child is $15,000, and they usually fine only the subcontracted companies, not the brands themselves. Lawmakers have been pushing to increase the maximum fine, but Congress is gridlocked, with each party drafting its own bills and refusing to vote for legislation introduced by the other side. (Perdue and Tyson said in statements that they have no tolerance for child labor and were taking steps to eliminate violations at plants nationwide. A spokesman for Fayette said the company was unaware of any minors on staff and learned of Marcos’s true age only after he was injured. The company said it is taking steps to protect against child-labor violations.)Because Marcos had been hospitalized, Fayette, Perdue’s sanitation provider, was required to notify the Occupational Safety and Health Administration about the accident. Federal officials passed the information to Virginia’s state office to investigate. It was assigned to a compliance officer who advertised on his LinkedIn profile that he started working at 14, first as a dishwasher at a bar and then in construction. The officer opted to let the company do a self-inspection. A few days later, Fayette’s safety director sent back most of the information the officer had asked for. One detail was left out: the injured worker’s age. The director indicated that the accident had been caused by “poor training.” Less than two weeks after Marcos’s injury, the compliance officer closed the case with no citations and without coming near Dreamland or the plant.","At Perdue, night-shift workers worried that the bosses would start firing children and others who used false names after Marcos got hurt. But the plant kept running more or less as it had been, though supervisors stopped letting students leave early to catch the school bus, because it seemed like a tacit admission that the shift was filled with minors. The cleaning company was always hiring, and new workers went through several nights of instruction. As part of the plant’s safety protocol, each new hire was given a padlock for the machine he or she was cleaning to ensure it couldn’t be turned on. After Marcos’s accident, trainers started bringing in a worker to explain the importance of this step. The man warned new hires that he had noticed a child who sometimes neglected to use the lock, and one night that child nearly lost his arm. He told the group that he regretted staying silent — not about Marcos’s young age, but about the fact that he had apparently misunderstood the padlock system. Emilio Ortiz, 14, went through this orientation and wondered what happened to the boy who got hurt. Emilio had recently come to Virginia from Chiapas, Mexico, to join his two older brothers, who already had a year of experience on the night shift. The brothers were released to an aunt by the Health and Human Services shelter system in 2021, when they were 15 and 16. Within a few months, they had earned enough money to buy their own trailer. Now, with Emilio working, too, they were sending money back to their parents.","Emilio didn’t go to school. He worked until 5 p.m. each day in agriculture, then grabbed an employee badge stamped with the Perdue logo and car-pooled with his brothers to the slaughterhouse. He stopped going to school in Mexico several years earlier, and the idea of enrolling in eighth grade seemed like a waste of time given how much money he could make.","One night this spring, Emilio crossed the parking lot just before the shift started, clutching his bulky green uniform under his arm and half running to keep up with his older brother. Some underage workers were assigned to tackle the kill room, while others would spend the shift on ladders cleaning tall pieces of machinery. Emilio was assigned to one of the assembly lines, as Marcos had been. The routine was the same every night. He and his brothers used pressure hoses that kicked back against their shoulders and chests to wash away the blood and meat scraps. Most workers wore earplugs to drown out the hoses and roaring machines. The scalding water created billows of steam, and within an hour, the brothers would be drenched in runoff and chicken grime. Working with a partner, Emilio would turn on the conveyor belt and coat it in a thick chemical foam that made his lungs ache. Then he stopped the line and scrubbed it inch by inch, using a flashlight to check corners and undersides. Chemical burns could be hard to avoid. One teenager with a welt on his nose explained that he was burned the night before seemingly out of nowhere; maybe the chemical had dripped down from the ceiling. The worst part of the job was the finishing acid used on Fridays. Another boy who cut the three brothers’ hair in a shed behind his Dreamland trailer warned them about this part. He, too, had started working at the plant when he was 14, when his sponsor moved out of state and he had to find a way to pay rent by himself. “It makes you cough all weekend, but then by Monday you’re OK again,” he said. After the machines are clean, a U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector looks them over. About a dozen of these inspectors work at each plant. During the day, they watch carcasses whiz by on production lines, and as the overnight shift finishes, they ensure that everything is properly sanitized. The three brothers tended to leave the area or look at the ground when the inspectors came around; they seemed connected with law enforcement. A U.S.D.A. inspector named Maria Escalante worked the Perdue cleaning shift as an adult in the 1990s when she settled in Virginia. She came from Guatemala and obtained legal status under an amnesty program. Back then, cleaners were hired directly by the company and earned more than $25 an hour in today’s dollars. She saw the inspectors walking around in their clean white coats emblazoned with the U.S.D.A. logo and admired their air of authority. The job did not require a college degree, so she studied English and passed a written test after several attempts. She is now in her 18th year as an inspector, earning $28 an hour. She notices children like Emilio but has decided not to report them because her job is to ensure that the country’s food-safety laws are followed, not its labor laws. “It’s not my place to say anything, and anyway, they have no one here,” she says. “They have to work to at least pay rent.” She adds, “I see these kids, and they’re only 13, 14 years old. I do feel bad for them.”Escalante noticed that the child workers often seem to fumble the safety protocols. When she heard about Marcos’s injury, she assumed this was what happened. “These kids are always making mistakes and hurting themselves,” she says.","After work, she looks for the injured children and tries to help them. She spent a few weeks this year trying to track down a teenager who she heard had fallen from a ladder at Tyson and broken his leg. “But it’s hard because they’re working under other names,” she says.","As the number of migrant children working in American slaughterhouses has grown, adults have occasionally intervened. Last year, a Guatemalan girl working for Packers Sanitation showed up to middle school in Nebraska with acid burns on her hands and knees, and administrators called the police. The Department of Labor began a monthslong investigation into the company and found more than 100 children, some as young as 13, working in eight states, including at plants run by Tyson. The government fined the cleaning company $1.5 million, but the brands that benefited from the children’s labor faced no consequences.","At Perdue, some women noticed Emilio and his siblings sitting quietly next to one another on breaks and started calling them “the sad brothers.” Angelica Gonzalez, who was on the night shift and had children of her own, often chatted with them. She sometimes bought the working children clothes from Walmart or offered them her husband’s castoffs. “I don’t know how they can stand to be so far from their parents and working so hard,” she says. “I ask how they do it, and they just say, ‘We have to.’” Other workers judged the children’s parents for sending them out alone to earn money. Arelis Perez, who lives in Dreamland with her two young daughters, recently noticed that a ninth grader who lived near the park entrance had joined the cleaning crew. She was disturbed by how distressed the child looked during her first weeks on the shift. “I would never want my girls to do that,” she says. One morning in May, Marcos was the first in his seat in the newcomers section of Arcadia High School. His class was in a back hallway decorated with international flags as part of a program the district set up several years ago for migrant children. Now nearing the end of ninth grade, he was trying to make peace with his role as a full-time student. He had drawn a smiling picture of himself on the white board in the front of the room and had written, in English, “The best student is Marcos.” His English language teacher, Sandra Ellenberger, decided to leave it there for the week. The school had divided the migrant ninth graders into two cohorts. Ellenberger’s class was full of students who teachers thought might make it to graduation. Few of these children worked, and most were living with their parents. The other class was larger, and 90 percent of the students eventually stopped coming to school. Marcos had been placed in the smaller class. “Happy Cinco de Mayo,” Ellenberger said as students filed in. She was playing mariachi music for the occasion. Like most teachers in the program, she didn’t speak much Spanish, but she looked for ways to show the children that she respected their cultures. She had decorated her classroom with local newspaper clippings about the school’s varsity soccer team, which is composed of so many newcomers that announcements at the games are in Spanish. She put a beanbag chair in a converted closet so students who worked overnight shifts could rest before the bell rang.","Ellenberger passed out a quiz, and Marcos began to fly through the questions, nodding his head to the music. When a boy sitting next to him got stuck on the conjugation of a verb, he explained the rule, murmuring, “Don’t worry, it’s really tricky.” Ellenberger spent the past year wondering if she should be doing more to protect her working students. She is from a college town where the hardest job a child might find is busing tables. When she told her parents about Marcos’s injury, they couldn’t understand how children were allowed in slaughterhouses. “They were horrified, but I explained that’s normal here,” she says. Teachers are mandated by law to report injuries resulting from abuse or neglect but not accidents connected to child-labor violations. In Accomack, teachers hesitated to make reports that might further jeopardize children they knew needed to work. Occasionally, students showed teachers acid burns or confided that they were allergic to the cleaning solutions. Some of the ninth graders had what sounded like smokers’ coughs; one had been coughing so much that teachers spoke with her guardian, who said her lungs had been burned by bleach. Recently, Ellenberger told a school counselor that one of her ninth graders seemed to be struggling with the pressure of the overnight shift. Two migrant students had just died by suicide. She hoped someone might persuade the boy’s guardian to let him stop working. Instead, the counselor helped him find a car-pool from Perdue to the high school, so he would be on time. Ellenberger now felt she had been naïve to expect more. In the larger English-learners class next door, students trickled in slowly all morning. Their teacher, Claire Applegate, often walked into a mostly empty classroom. She estimated that 16 of her 19 students were working, some of them taking home nearly as much money as she did. Each fall, she made lists of their work schedules to keep at her desk — a yellow sticky note labeled “Perdue” and a blue one labeled “Tyson.” Two girls who lived at Dreamland walked in 45 minutes late, eyes red from cleaning chemicals. Applegate welcomed them and kept teaching as they fell asleep at their desks. Teachers were used to seeing middle schoolers sleeping outside the building first thing in the morning in cars they drove without licenses after coming directly from the overnight shift. But no one could remember a student getting as badly hurt as Marcos, and they worried about who might be next. Applegate sometimes listened to a police scanner at night and wondered if the emergencies involved her students. Once, firefighters responded to a call in which a Perdue sanitation worker was hoisted 20 feet in the air by a conveyor belt. They had to take him out of the factory with a piece of machinery still attached to his body.","Many of Applegate’s students had only a few years of education. Some didn’t know that a globe represented the shape of the world. Others had never learned how to hold a pencil, or interpret a clock, or read. Lately, though, she wasn’t sure if going to school made sense for the working children who were unlikely to graduate. If they weren’t coming to class, they could at least switch to the day shift and get a good night’s sleep. “It’s a moral dilemma because it’s not the best thing for them,” she said. “They’re not going to cut their hours, and sleep deprivation is one of the worst things you can do to your body. I question whether they should be here because they don’t really need to know geography or trigonometry.”The native-born teenagers tended to avoid socializing with recent arrivals, but Marcos was proud that he could now often keep up in mainstream classes. Even as he succeeded in school, though, his family was sliding further toward disaster. His mother had been sick and needed surgery, but she couldn’t find a hospital that would perform the operation without being paid beforehand. The $6,000 debt was weighing on his parents, with interest mounting. Marcos’s mother told him they were eating their chickens and turkeys and sometimes selling the larger animals to turn the lights back on. “They’re doing everything they can think of, but it’s impossible because they can’t work,” he said. After school, he returned to the trailer, which was now home to nine people. An aunt had come from Guatemala a month earlier with her 15-year-old daughter, Antonieta. His aunt had planned to work while Antonieta went to school, but they suffered a series of setbacks on their journey. Kidnappers held them hostage in Mexico and forced them to borrow from relatives to buy their freedom. They were turned back at the border and decided to cross through the desert, but his aunt fell from the border wall, shattering her leg and running up $107,000 in debt to an El Paso hospital. Now she was sleeping in the kitchen and using a walker, and instead of enrolling in ninth grade, Antonieta was looking for a job. As Marcos walked into the kitchen, his aunt was lost in worry. “I don’t know how we’re going to get through this,” she said. Marcos nodded to her, then hurried to his bedroom and closed the door. He opened a flashcard app on his phone and started matching vocabulary words to images. The sooner he learned English, the sooner he might be useful again. He might be able to get a job at a fast-food restaurant off the highway. Until then, there was not much he could do to help anyone.","On Saturdays, much of the town went to a small shop packed with specialty groceries, medicine with Spanish labels and piñatas to withdraw their salaries and send home remittances.","The store is more than just a place to wire money. Mary Enamorado, the woman at the cash register, acts as an informal social worker and immigration advocate. This part of the Eastern Shore has no pro bono immigration lawyers, few nonprofits and no Spanish-speaking community organizations beyond churches. Enamorado helps adults navigate the paperwork to sponsor minors, welcomes children once they arrive and dispenses advice. “So, are you working already?” she asked one of her first customers of the day, a student from Applegate’s class. Enamorado had helped the ninth grader’s brother apply to be her sponsor. Now she noticed that the girl had the white payroll debit card used by the sanitation companies. The companies deposited a week’s pay each Friday, and workers usually withdrew it all in cash the following day. The girl told Enamorado with pride that she had gotten a job.","Enamorado sympathized with children who worked nights but thought their sponsors were akin to traffickers. She had joined the cleaning shift herself when she first arrived in Virginia from Honduras in her early 20s and knew how dangerous it could be. She had been especially disgusted by what she heard of Marcos’s case. “Making a 13-year-old go to work like that?” she said. “Awful.”Enamorado’s son played on the varsity soccer team with many of the working children. The captain who led the team to state quarterfinals this year came to the United States on his own as a 12-year-old and started working immediately to pay his sponsor rent. He juggled the soccer team with shifts at Perdue, getting home at 10 p.m. after away games, sleeping a couple of hours and then heading to the plant. Now he was weeks away from graduating, one of a few students from his English-language-learners cohort who had made it through high school. “We can all be proud of him,” Enamorado said. She encouraged the migrant children who had dropped out of school to take G.E.D. classes at the local community college. Most dreamed instead of joining the military. Another girl came in with a white payroll card. She finished the Tyson cleaning shift a few hours earlier and still had a headache from the night’s chemicals. Enamorado counted out $500 for her and gave her a discount on a bag of ice pops. “Take care of yourself,” she said. When the girl walked out, Enamorado shook her head. She had tried to encourage the girl’s sponsor to enroll her in school. “But they have $14,000 in debt to pay off,” she said. Technically, minors are not supposed to send wire transfers, and Enamorado was supposed to check their IDs. But when she tried to enforce the rule, customers complained. “They just have fake papers anyway,” she said. The store got more crowded in the afternoon. A boy with the beginnings of a mustache withdrew his $500 and bought a bottle of nonalcoholic wine. A teenager who had recently dropped out of 10th grade so he could switch to the day shift sent $150 to his mother. Another child came in, a slight 15-year-old who had played on the soccer team with Enamorado’s son but dropped out after spring break to work at Perdue during the day. He was too short to rest his elbows on the counter. “Is your uncle not letting you go to school?” she asked as he ran his payroll card. “They don’t let me,” he said.","“Who exactly?” Enamorado asked.","The boy didn’t answer. Sometimes, she wanted to interrogate the children who came in with payroll cards, but she also knew that would be bad for business. There was another store with a card reader a few miles up the highway. She handed the boy $500 and then helped him send money to his mother. “They miss you on the soccer team,” she said.","A week later, Enamorado was in place behind the counter again for the Saturday rush. Applegate’s student came back with her brother. As the girl used the payroll-card reader, she and her brother explained that it would be her last payday for a while. The cleaning-shift supervisor had called her into his office, she said, and told her that she had done a good job, but minors were no longer allowed at the plant. Enamorado counted out $500 and told the girl that with any luck she would find a new job before too long. But she knew there were few jobs to be had in Accomack beyond the poultry industry.","I began visiting Parksley in the summer of 2022 as part of reporting I’ve been doing on migrant child labor over the past year and a half. When the first of these articles ran, the Biden administration responded by stepping up child-labor enforcement."," Each time I went back to Parksley after that, I wondered whether I would find that children had been fired from the Perdue and Tyson plants. I thought labor inspectors might audit the plants. But the peninsula continued to keep its secret. That changed in May, after Perdue got word that I was reporting on the plant during one of my Parksley trips. The company sent out a warning that I was looking into its operations. Soon slaughterhouses around the country began passing out fliers with my photograph. In Accomack, the assistant night manager, Cobo, gathered 150 sanitation workers for a midnight meeting at Perdue. They sat sweating in their rubberized uniforms as he told them that minors were no longer welcome. Some children got mad and said they needed the jobs to survive. Others took the news quietly but then made private appeals to the supervisors. “They were looking at me with tears in their eyes,” Cobo remembers. Afterward, Fayette, the sanitation company, sent an inspector to look over the remaining workers and ensure none were minors.","Supervisors who oversaw the cleaning shift at the Tyson plant warned their corporate office that a reporter was spending a lot of time in town. By June, all the children I had been speaking to were out of jobs. Emilio was fired along with his two brothers, and his agricultural job became the family’s only source of income. His older brothers spent their days stewing over what happened at the plant. “They made plenty of money from our labor and then tossed us out like trash,” one says.","After the firings, Arcadia High teachers noticed that some ninth graders were suddenly coming to class on time. Their eyes were less red, and they seemed more animated, laughing with friends and shouting out answers. At the end of the school year, Marcos was the only ninth grader in the newcomers program to earn a passing score on a statewide standardized test on his first try. But Ellenberger, his teacher, saw that he was troubled. He continued to fill his English workbooks with references to home. One exercise asked about his dream job. “To help my family,” he wrote. Another asked what made him happy. “My parents.”He was starting to accept that he would probably never wear short sleeves again. At his most recent checkup, the doctor explained that his arm had healed badly and he would need at least three more surgeries. Marcos found himself crying in the examination room for the first time. “I thought they were going to tell me I was finally done,” he said. “It made me realize I might never get better.” Fayette is still covering his medical care, but he needed to go to Baltimore for the surgeries and hadn’t found anyone to drive him there. Workers said the cleaning crew at Perdue struggled through the summer. Supervisors told the remaining staff that everyone would have to clean more areas until they could find more workers. Eventually, adults started to see young faces again. A few of Marcos’s classmates were hired back. One teenager who could no longer work at Tyson was able to switch to the Perdue cleaning shift with a set of fake papers. Toward the end of the summer, Marcos, now 15, was able to find something, too. It was a job that even the most desperate migrants shunned: sifting through industrial chicken warehouses and pulling out dead birds. Each day, he passed through entrances marked “Perdue family farmer,” put on two masks to guard against the overpowering smell of ammonia and waded in among thousands of chickens packed together in windowless coops. His task was to search the ground carefully for carcasses amid layers of excrement as the birds pecked frantically at his hands and feet. He started at 5 a.m. and removed between 100 and 150 dead birds during each 12-hour shift. “There are some dead chickens that are good and rotten — they explode,” he said. The chicken houses paid less than the sanitation crew, but he was still able to send $100 home to his parents after a few weeks. When school started again, his 15-year-old cousin Antonieta didn’t consider enrolling, but Marcos cut his shift back to just four hours in the evening and returned for 10th grade. If he learned English, he might get a higher-paying job outside the poultry industry. His teachers were happy to see him and fussed over how tall he had grown. But as school got underway, Marcos felt torn. The reduced hours meant that most days he was earning just $20, and he no longer had time to study when he got home. “Maybe the classes won’t assign so much homework this year,” he said. “Or maybe I’ll be able to do it all on the bus.” If he dropped out and worked full time, he might be able to pay off his family’s debt within a year.","One afternoon in September, he hurried off the school bus and back to his trailer to get ready for his shift. He threw his backpack in a corner; he wouldn’t start on his outstanding assignments until the next morning. Antonia was at Perdue, so Marcos car-pooled with another chicken-house worker. The man honked when he arrived, and they drove out of Dreamland, going slowly to avoid the potholes. They passed the green jackets on clotheslines. They passed a girl with a puppy who had dropped out after eighth grade to work at Tyson. They passed the assistant manager’s home, with its new wood porch, and then the shed where migrant children were lining up to get their hair cut.","Marcos wouldn’t be back until after dark. He usually got home around 8 p.m., but he would stay at the chicken houses longer if there were more dead birds to find. It had been a sweltering day, which would mean additional carcasses and, he hoped, more work.","Research was contributed by Seamus Hughes, Eli Murray and Julie Tate.","Meridith Kohut is a photojournalist who earned a Courage in Journalism award for her decade of work documenting international humanitarian crises for The Times.

culinary and food traditions of Tunisian society.” Keyword: Tunisian.","As first-generation Tunisian Americans, Mansour and Karim Arem, brothers and the founders of the Tunisian food company Zwïta, didn’t see their cuisine widely represented in the United States — and felt that the lack of representation extended to harissa. Though used across North Africa, and especially in the central and western region known as the Maghreb, harissa originated in Tunisia. But the Arems have long wondered: How many people actually know that? That’s why the UNESCO designation felt like such a win. But for the brothers, it’s not a contest. It’s not about authenticity, either. It’s about connecting the dots for consumers who want to cook with actual Tunisian harissa.","Over the years, online and in stores, I have bought sweet jarred versions labeled “sauce,” dried spice blends and smooth pastes that come in a tube. But none of these tasted like the thick, Tunisian-style harissa that the Arem brothers were raised on — with its bold sundried-chile flavor and, in Mansour’s words, “vibrant, Bordeaux red” color. It is, for them, more than a business venture: It’s culinary diplomacy, the passing on of living knowledge.","The most traditional chile used is the baklouti, Mansour says, a mild pepper named after the city Bekalta, “but other less popular varieties are also used.” Once harvested, the chiles are sometimes garlanded with string and left to dry in the sun, an essential process that can take as long as a month, depending on the weather. Cleaned and deseeded, they are then soaked in water, drained and ground into a paste with salt and whole cloves of garlic. Extra-virgin olive oil, coriander and caraway join the chiles, and sometimes lemon juice or vinegar as well, for brightness and preservation.","This year, Mansour visited Tunisia because his grandmother Béchira died. As he was flipping through old photographs, he remembered the last meal she made for him: a meaty merguez stew ablaze with harissa (called markat merguez, tajine merguez or markat kaaber, depending on whom you ask). It was fine-tuned, the dish at its maximum potential: pickled olives and red peppers swimming in a deep-crimson pool of olive oil, with headily spiced meatballs bobbing like floats. Still, it retained all the makings of his mother’s version, run through with memories of her watching “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” one of her favorite shows, in her pajamas as he and his brother played their Nintendo 64, all waiting for the stew to finish simmering.","You could say the stew connects Mansour to his Tunisian roots, but it’s even more the harissa across his family dishes, whether as a smear or as a flavor base, that anchors him to the motherland no matter where he is in the world. That’s because in Tunisia, everything relies on a little harissa: a savory triangular pastry pocket, brik; a fried sandwich, fricassée, stuffed with tuna and boiled eggs; a spicy stew traditionally made with liver and meat, kamounia (but in their home, it was sometimes lovingly made with octopus).","As I spent time with harissa, corresponding regularly with Mansour over the past year, I’ve gotten to know it beyond the ways it was always marketed to me. I’ve cooked his mother’s merguez stew and marinated salmon with the brothers’ smoky harissa, which comes in a jar. But it was Mansour’s simple recipe for chicken wings that taught me the most about how to underscore (without weighing it down) a taste as bright, beautiful and specific as harissa.","In that way, this recipe is quietly surprising, like the best lessons in life. First, dry-roasting the wings ensures a thin skin that’s at once crispy and airy under the fire-bright sauce. The sauce, you don’t even have to cook. Just stir together pantry staples: soy sauce for savoriness and depth, balsamic glaze for sweetness and tartness and extra-virgin olive oil to accentuate the fruity flavors of the Tunisian chile paste.","As you attempt this recipe, know that you must use harissa. There is no substitute. And if you swap it out for another chile paste, delicious though that recipe will be, you won’t have made harissa wings — you’ll have made gochujang wings, chile crisp wings, Buffalo wings.","“Obviously, this combination of ingredients isn’t by any means innovative,” Mansour said with modesty. But I would argue that it’s the careful calibration of them, and the way they play up the harissa, that makes this sauce a life-changing addition to my cooking repertoire, a treasure worth keeping."," "]', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/magazine/harissa-chicken-wings.html', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/24/magazine/24mag-Eat/24mag-Eat-facebookJumbo.jpg', '2023-09-20 09:00:58.138+00', '2023-09-21 23:54:51.813786+00');

Though humans have lived alongside mice for at least 15,000 years, few of us have ever heard mice sing, because they do so in frequencies beyond the range detectable by human hearing. As pups, their high-pitched songs alert their mothers to their whereabouts; as adults, they sing in ultrasound to woo one another. For decades, researchers considered mouse songs instinctual, the fixed tunes of a windup music box, rather than the mutable expressions of individual minds.","But no one had tested whether that was really true. In 2012, a team of neurobiologists at Duke University, led by Erich Jarvis, a neuroscientist who studies vocal learning, designed an experiment to find out. The team surgically deafened five mice and recorded their songs in a mouse-size sound studio, tricked out with infrared cameras and microphones. They then compared sonograms of the songs of deafened mice with those of hearing mice. If the mouse songs were innate, as long presumed, the surgical alteration would make no difference at all.","Jarvis and his researchers slowed down the tempo and shifted the pitch of the recordings, so that they could hear the songs with their own ears. Those of the intact mice sounded “remarkably similar to some bird songs,” Jarvis wrote in a 2013 paper that described the experiment, with whistlelike syllables similar to those in the songs of canaries and the trills of dolphins. Not so the songs of the deafened mice: Deprived of auditory feedback, their songs became degraded, rendering them nearly unrecognizable. They sounded, the scientists noted, like “squawks and screams.” Not only did the tunes of a mouse depend on its ability to hear itself and others, but also, as the team found in another experiment, a male mouse could alter the pitch of its song to compete with other male mice for female attention.","Inside these murine skills lay clues to a puzzle many have called “the hardest problem in science”: the origins of language. In humans, “vocal learning” is understood as a skill critical to spoken language. Researchers had already discovered the capacity for vocal learning in species other than humans, including in songbirds, hummingbirds, parrots, cetaceans such as dolphins and whales, pinnipeds such as seals, elephants and bats. But given the centuries-old idea that a deep chasm separated human language from animal communications, most scientists understood the vocal learning abilities of other species as unrelated to our own — as evolutionarily divergent as the wing of a bat is to that of a bee. The apparent absence of intermediate forms of language — say, a talking animal — left the question of how language evolved resistant to empirical inquiry.","When the Duke researchers dissected the brains of the hearing and deafened mice, they found a rudimentary version of the neural circuitry that allows the forebrains of vocal learners such as humans and songbirds to directly control their vocal organs. Mice don’t seem to have the vocal flexibility of elephants; they cannot, like the 10-year-old female African elephant in Tsavo, Kenya, mimic the sound of trucks on the nearby Nairobi-Mombasa highway. Or the gift for mimicry of seals; an orphaned harbor seal at the New England Aquarium could utter English phrases in a perfect Maine accent (“Hoover, get over here,” he said. “Come on, come on!”).","But the rudimentary skills of mice suggested that the language-critical capacity might exist on a continuum, much like a submerged land bridge might indicate that two now-isolated continents were once connected. In recent years, an array of findings have also revealed an expansive nonhuman soundscape, including: turtles that produce and respond to sounds to coordinate the timing of their birth from inside their eggs; coral larvae that can hear the sounds of healthy reefs; and plants that can detect the sound of running water and the munching of insect predators. Researchers have found intention and meaning in this cacophony, such as the purposeful use of different sounds to convey information. They’ve theorized that one of the most confounding aspects of language, its rules-based internal structure, emerged from social drives common across a range of species.","With each discovery, the cognitive and moral divide between humanity and the rest of the animal world has eroded. For centuries, the linguistic utterances of Homo sapiens have been positioned as unique in nature, justifying our dominion over other species and shrouding the evolution of language in mystery. Now, experts in linguistics, biology and cognitive science suspect that components of language might be shared across species, illuminating the inner lives of animals in ways that could help stitch language into their evolutionary history — and our own.","For hundreds of years, language marked “the true difference between man and beast,” as the philosopher René Descartes wrote in 1649. As recently as the end of the last century, archaeologists and anthropologists speculated that 40,000 to 50,000 years ago a “human revolution” fractured evolutionary history, creating an unbridgeable gap separating humanity’s cognitive and linguistic abilities from those of the rest of the animal world. Linguists and other experts reinforced this idea. In 1959, the M.I.T. linguist Noam Chomsky, then 30, wrote a blistering 33-page takedown of a book by the celebrated behaviorist B.F. Skinner, which argued that language was just a form of “verbal behavior,” as Skinner titled the book, accessible to any species given sufficient conditioning. One observer called it “perhaps the most devastating review ever written.” Between 1972 and 1990, there were more citations of Chomsky’s critique than Skinner’s book, which bombed.","The view of language as a uniquely human superpower, one that enabled Homo sapiens to write epic poetry and send astronauts to the moon, presumed some uniquely human biology to match. But attempts to find those special biological mechanisms — whether physiological, neurological, genetic — that make language possible have all come up short. One high-profile example came in 2001, when a team led by the geneticists Cecilia Lai and Simon Fisher discovered a gene — called FoxP2 — in a London family riddled with childhood apraxia of speech, a disorder that impairs the ability of otherwise cognitively capable individuals to coordinate their muscles to produce sounds, syllables and words in an intelligible sequence. Commentators hailed FoxP2 as the long sought-after gene that enabled humans to talk — until the gene turned up in the genomes of rodents, birds, reptiles, fish and ancient hominins such as Neanderthals, whose version of FoxP2 is much like ours. (Fisher so often encountered the public expectation that FoxP2 was the “language gene” that he resolved to acquire a T-shirt that read, “It’s more complicated than that.”)The search for an exclusively human vocal anatomy has failed, too. For a 2001 study, the cognitive scientist Tecumseh Fitch cajoled goats, dogs, deer and other species to vocalize while inside a cineradiograph machine that filmed the way their larynxes moved under X-ray. Fitch discovered that species with larynxes different from ours — ours is “descended” and located in our throats rather than our mouths — could nevertheless move them in similar ways. One of them, the red deer, even had the same descended larynx we do.","Fitch and his then-colleague at Harvard, the evolutionary biologist Marc Hauser, began to wonder if they’d been thinking about language all wrong. Linguists described language as a singular skill, like being able to swim or bake a soufflé: You either had it or you didn’t. But perhaps language was more like a multicomponent system that included psychological traits, such as the ability to share intentions; physiological ones, such as motor control over vocalizations and gestures; and cognitive capacities, such as the ability to combine signals according to rules, many of which might appear in other animals as well.","Fitch, whom I spoke to by Zoom in his office at the University of Vienna, drafted a paper with Hauser as a “kind of an argument against Chomsky,” he told me. As a courtesy, he sent the M.I.T. linguist a draft. One evening, he and Hauser were sitting in their respective offices along the same hall at Harvard when an email from Chomsky dinged their inboxes. “We both read it and we walked out of our rooms going, ‘What?’” Chomsky indicated that not only did he agree, but that he’d be willing to sign on to their next paper on the subject as a co-author."," That paper, which has since racked up more than 7,000 citations, appeared in the journal Science in 2002.","Squabbles continued over which components of language were shared with other species and which, if any, were exclusive to humans. Those included, among others, language’s intentionality, its system of combining signals, its ability to refer to external concepts and things separated by time and space and its power to generate an infinite number of expressions from a finite number of signals. But reflexive belief in language as an evolutionary anomaly started to dissolve. “For the biologists,” recalled Fitch, “it was like, ‘Oh, good, finally the linguists are being reasonable.’”Evidence of continuities between animal communication and human language continued to mount. The sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 suggested that we hadn’t significantly diverged from that lineage, as the theory of a “human revolution” posited. On the contrary, Neanderthal genes and those of other ancient hominins persisted in the modern human genome, evidence of how intimately we were entangled. In 2014, Jarvis found that the neural circuits that allowed songbirds to learn and produce novel sounds matched those in humans, and that the genes that regulated those circuits evolved in similar ways. The accumulating evidence left “little room for doubt,” Cedric Boeckx, a theoretical linguist at the University of Barcelona, noted in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience."," “There was no ‘great leap forward.’” As our understanding of the nature and origin of language shifted, a host of fruitful cross-disciplinary collaborations arose. Colleagues of Chomsky’s, such as the M.I.T. linguist Shigeru Miyagawa, whose early career was shaped by the precept that “we’re smart, they’re not,” applied for grants with primatologists and neuroscientists to study how human language might be related to birdsong and primate calls. Interdisciplinary centers sprang up devoted specifically to the evolution of language, including at the University of Zurich and the University of Edinburgh. Lectures at a biannual conference on language evolution once dominated by “armchair theorizing,” as the cognitive scientist and founder of the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Language Evolution, Simon Kirby, put it, morphed into presentations “completely packed with empirical data.”One of the thorniest problems researchers sought to address was the link between thought and language. Philosophers and linguists long held that language must have evolved not for the purpose of communication but to facilitate abstract thought. The grammatical rules that structure language, a feature of languages from Algonquin to American Sign Language, are more complex than necessary for communication. Language, the argument went, must have evolved to help us think, in much the same way that mathematical notations allow us to make complex calculations. Ev Fedorenko, a cognitive neuroscientist at M.I.T., thought this was “a cool idea,” so, about a decade ago, she set out to test it. If language is the medium of thought, she reasoned, then thinking a thought and absorbing the meaning of spoken or written words should activate the same neural circuits in the brain, like two streams fed by the same underground spring. Earlier brain-imaging studies showed that patients with severe aphasia could still solve mathematical problems, despite their difficulty in deciphering or producing language, but failed to pinpoint distinctions between brain regions dedicated to thought and those dedicated to language. Fedorenko suspected that might be because the precise location of these regions varied from individual to individual. In a 2011 study, she asked healthy subjects to make computations and decipher snatches of spoken and written language while she watched how blood flowed to aroused parts of their brains using an M.R.I. machine, taking their unique neural circuitry into account in her subsequent analysis. Her fM.R.I. studies showed that thinking thoughts and decoding words mobilized distinct brain pathways. Language and thought, Fedorenko says, “really are separate in an adult human brain.”At the University of Edinburgh, Kirby hit upon a process that might explain how language’s internal structure evolved. That structure, in which simple elements such as sounds and words are arranged into phrases and nested hierarchically within one another, gives language the power to generate an infinite number of meanings; it is a key feature of language as well as of mathematics and music. But its origins were hazy. Because children intuit the rules that govern linguistic structure with little if any explicit instruction, philosophers and linguists argued that it must be a product of some uniquely human cognitive process. But researchers who scrutinized the fossil record to determine when and how that process evolved were stumped: The first sentences uttered left no trace behind.","Kirby designed an experiment to simulate the evolution of language inside his lab. First, he developed made-up codes to serve as proxies for the disordered collections of words widely believed to have preceded the emergence of structured language, such as random sequences of colored lights or a series of pantomimes. Then he recruited subjects to use the code under a variety of conditions and studied how the code changed. He asked subjects to use the code to solve communication tasks, for example, or to pass the code on to one another as in a game of telephone. He ran the experiment hundreds of times using different parameters on a variety of subjects, including on a colony of baboons living in a seminaturalistic enclosure equipped with a bank of computers on which they could choose to play his experimental games.","What he found was striking: Regardless of the native tongue of the subjects, or whether they were baboons, college students or robots, the results were the same. When individuals passed the code on to one another, the code became simpler but also less precise. But when they passed it on to one another and also used it to communicate, the code developed a distinct architecture. Random sequences of colored lights turned into richly patterned ones; convoluted, pantomimic gestures for words such as “church” or “police officer” became abstract, efficient signs. “We just saw, spontaneously emerging out of this experiment, the language structures we were waiting for,” Kirby says. His findings suggest that language’s mystical power — its ability to turn the noise of random signals into intelligible formulations — may have emerged from a humble trade-off: between simplicity, for ease of learning, and what Kirby called “expressiveness,” for unambiguous communication.","For Descartes, the equation of language with thought meant animals had no mental life at all: “The brutes,” he opined, “don’t have any thought.” Breaking the link between language and human biology didn’t just demystify language; it restored the possibility of mind to the animal world and repositioned linguistic capacities as theoretically accessible to any social species.","The search for the components of language in nonhuman animals now extends to the far reaches of our phylogenetic tree, encompassing creatures that may communicate in radically unfamiliar ways.","This summer, I met with Marcelo Magnasco, a biophysicist, and Diana Reiss, a psychologist at Hunter College who studies dolphin cognition, in Magnasco’s lab at Rockefeller University. Overlooking the East River, it was a warmly lit room, with rows of burbling tanks inhabited by octopuses, whose mysterious signals they hoped to decode. Magnasco became curious about the cognitive and communicative abilities of cephalopods while diving recreationally, he told me. Numerous times, he said, he encountered cephalopods and had “the overpowering impression that they were trying to communicate with me.” During the Covid-19 shutdown, when his work studying dolphin communication with Reiss was derailed, Magnasco found himself driving to a Petco in Staten Island to buy tanks for octopuses to live in his lab.","During my visit, the grayish pink tentacles of the octopus clinging to the side of the glass wall of her tank started to flash bright white. Was she angry? Was she trying to tell us something? Was she even aware of our presence? There was no way to know, Magnasco said. Earlier efforts to find linguistic capacities in other species failed, in part, he explained, because we assumed they would look like our own. But the communication systems of other species might, in fact, be “truly exotic to us,” Magnasco said. A species that can recognize objects by echolocation, as cetaceans and bats can, might communicate using acoustic pictographs, for example, which might sound to us like meaningless chirps or clicks. To disambiguate the meaning of animal signals, such as a string of dolphin clicks or whalesong, scientists needed some inkling of where meaning-encoding units began and ended, Reiss explained. “We, in fact, have no idea what the smallest unit is,” she said. If scientists analyze animal calls using the wrong segmentation, meaningful expressions turn into meaningless drivel: “ad ogra naway” instead of “a dog ran away.”An international initiative called Project CETI, founded by David Gruber, a biologist at the City University of New York, hopes to get around this problem by feeding recordings of sperm-whale clicks, known as codas, into computer models, which might be able to discern patterns in them, in the same way that ChatGPT was able to grasp vocabulary and grammar in human language by analyzing publicly available text. Another method, Reiss says, is to provide animal subjects with artificial codes and observe how they use them.","Reiss’s research on dolphin cognition is one of a handful of projects on animal communication that dates back to the 1980s, when there were widespread funding cuts in the field, after a top researcher retracted his much-hyped claim that a chimpanzee could be trained to use sign language to converse with humans. In a study published in 1993, Reiss offered bottlenose dolphins at a facility in Northern California an underwater keypad that allowed them to choose specific toys, which it delivered while emitting computer-generated whistles, like a kind of vending machine. The dolphins spontaneously began mimicking the computer-generated whistles when they played independently with the corresponding toy, like kids tossing a ball and naming it “ball, ball, ball,” Reiss told me. “The behavior,” Reiss said, “was strikingly similar to the early stages of language acquisition in children.”  The researchers hoped to replicate the method by outfitting an octopus tank with an interactive platform of some kind and observing how the octopus engaged with it. But it was unclear whether such a device might interest the lone cephalopod. An earlier episode of displeasure led her to discharge enough ink to turn her tank water so black that she couldn’t be seen. Unlocking her communicative abilities might require that she consider the scientists as fascinating as they did her.","While experimenting with animals trapped in cages and tanks can reveal their latent faculties, figuring out the range of what animals are communicating to one another requires spying on them in the wild. Past studies often conflated general communication, in which individuals extract meaning from signals sent by other individuals, with language’s more specific, flexible and open-ended system. In a seminal 1980 study, for example, the primatologists Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney used the “playback” technique to decode the meaning of alarm calls issued by vervet monkeys at Amboseli National Park in Kenya. When a recording of the barklike calls emitted by a vervet encountering a leopard was played back to other vervets, it sent them scampering into the trees. Recordings of the low grunts of a vervet who spotted an eagle led other vervets to look up into the sky; recordings of the high-pitched chutters emitted by a vervet upon noticing a python caused them to scan the ground.","At the time, The New York Times ran a front-page story heralding the discovery of a “rudimentary ‘language’” in vervet monkeys."," But critics objected that the calls might not have any properties of language at all. Instead of being intentional messages to communicate meaning to others, the calls might be involuntary, emotion-driven sounds, like the cry of a hungry baby. Such involuntary expressions can transmit rich information to listeners, but unlike words and sentences, they don’t allow for discussion of things separated by time and space. The barks of a vervet in the throes of leopard-induced terror could alert other vervets to the presence of a leopard — but couldn’t provide any way to talk about, say, “the really smelly leopard who showed up at the ravine yesterday morning.”Toshitaka Suzuki, an ethologist at the University of Tokyo who describes himself as an animal linguist, struck upon a method to disambiguate intentional calls from involuntary ones while soaking in a bath one day. When we spoke over Zoom, he showed me an image of a fluffy cloud. “If you hear the word ‘dog,’ you might see a dog,” he pointed out, as I gazed at the white mass. “If you hear the word ‘cat,’ you might see a cat.” That, he said, marks the difference between a word and a sound. “Words influence how we see objects,” he said. “Sounds do not.” Using playback studies, Suzuki determined that Japanese tits, songbirds that live in East Asian forests and that he has studied for more than 15 years, emit a special vocalization when they encounter snakes. When other Japanese tits heard a recording of the vocalization, which Suzuki dubbed the “jar jar” call, they searched the ground, as if looking for a snake. To determine whether “jar jar” meant “snake” in Japanese tit, he added another element to his experiments: an eight-inch stick, which he dragged along the surface of a tree using hidden strings. Usually, Suzuki found, the birds ignored the stick. It was, by his analogy, a passing cloud. But then he played a recording of the “jar jar” call. In that case, the stick seemed to take on new significance: The birds approached the stick, as if examining whether it was, in fact, a snake. Like a word, the “jar jar” call had changed their perception.","Cat Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St. Andrews who works with great apes, developed a similarly nuanced method. Because great apes appear to have a relatively limited repertoire of vocalizations, Hobaiter studies their gestures. For years, she and her collaborators have followed chimps in the Budongo forest and gorillas in Bwindi in Uganda, recording their gestures and how others respond to them. “Basically, my job is to get up in the morning to get the chimps when they’re coming down out of the tree, or the gorillas when they’re coming out of the nest, and just to spend the day with them,” she told me. So far, she says, she has recorded about 15,600 instances of gestured exchanges between apes.","To determine whether the gestures are involuntary or intentional, she uses a method adapted from research on human babies. Hobaiter looks for signals that evoke what she calls an “Apparently Satisfactory Outcome.” The method draws on the theory that involuntary signals continue even after listeners have understood their meaning, while intentional ones stop once the signaler realizes her listener has comprehended the signal. It’s the difference between the continued wailing of a hungry baby after her parents have gone to fetch a bottle, Hobaiter explains, and my entreaties to you to pour me some coffee, which cease once you start reaching for the coffeepot. To search for a pattern, she says she and her researchers have looked “across hundreds of cases and dozens of gestures and different individuals using the same gesture across different days.” So far, her team’s analysis of 15 years’ worth of video-recorded exchanges has pinpointed dozens of ape gestures that trigger “apparently satisfactory outcomes.”These gestures may also be legible to us, albeit beneath our conscious awareness. Hobaiter applied her technique on pre-verbal 1- and 2-year-old children, following them around recording their gestures and how they affected attentive others, “like they’re tiny apes, which they basically are,” she says. She also posted short video clips of ape gestures online and asked adult visitors who’d never spent any time with great apes to guess what they thought they meant. She found that pre-verbal human children use at least 40 or 50 gestures from the ape repertoire, and adults correctly guessed the meaning of video-recorded ape gestures at a rate “significantly higher than expected by chance,” as Hobaiter and Kirsty E. Graham, a postdoctoral research fellow in Hobaiter’s lab, reported in a 2023 paper for PLOS Biology.","The emerging research might seem to suggest that there’s nothing very special about human language. Other species use intentional wordlike signals just as we do. Some, such as Japanese tits and pied babblers, have been known to combine different signals to make new meanings. Many species are social and practice cultural transmission, satisfying what might be prerequisite for a structured communication system like language. And yet a stubborn fact remains. The species that use features of language in their communications have few obvious geographical or phylogenetic similarities. And despite years of searching, no one has discovered a communication system with all the properties of language in any species other than our own. For some scientists, the mounting evidence of cognitive and linguistic continuities between humans and animals outweighs evidence of any gaps. “There really isn’t such a sharp distinction,” Jarvis, now at Rockefeller University, said in a podcast. Fedorenko agrees. The idea of a chasm separating man from beast is a product of “language elitism,” she says, as well as a myopic focus on “how different language is from everything else.”But for others, the absence of clear evidence of all the components of language in other species is, in fact, evidence of their absence. In a 2016 book on language evolution titled “Why Only Us,” written with the linguist Robert C. Berwick, Chomsky describes animal communications as “radically different” from human language. Seyfarth and Cheney, in a 2018 book, note the “striking discontinuities” between human and nonhuman loquacity. Animal calls may be modifiable; they may be voluntary and intentional. But they’re rarely combined according to rules in the way that human words are and “appear to convey only limited information,” they write. If animals had anything like the full suite of linguistic components we do, Kirby says, we would know by now. Animals with similar cognitive and social capacities to ours rarely express themselves systematically the way we do, with systemwide cues to distinguish different categories of meaning. “We just don’t see that kind of level of systematicity in the communication systems of other species,” Kirby said in a 2021 talk.","This evolutionary anomaly may seem strange if you consider language an unalloyed benefit. But what if it isn’t? Even the most wondrous abilities can have drawbacks. According to the popular “self-domestication” hypothesis of language’s origins, proposed by Kirby and James Thomas in a 2018 paper published in Biology & Philosophy, variable tones and inventive locutions might prevent members of a species from recognizing others of their kind. Or, as others have pointed out, they might draw the attention of predators. Such perils could help explain why domesticated species such as Bengalese finches have more complex and syntactically rich songs than their wild kin, the white-rumped munia, as discovered by the biopsychologist Kazuo Okanoya in 2012; why tamed foxes and domesticated canines exhibit heightened abilities to communicate, at least with humans, compared with wolves and wild foxes; and why humans, described by some experts as a domesticated species of their ape and hominin ancestors, might be the most talkative of all. A lingering gap between our abilities and those of other species, in other words, does not necessarily leave language stranded outside evolution. Perhaps, Fitch says, language is unique to Homo sapiens, but not in any unique way: special to humans in the same way the trunk is to the elephant and echolocation is to the bat.","The quest for language’s origins has yet to deliver King Solomon’s seal, a ring that magically bestows upon its wearer the power to speak to animals, or the future imagined in a short story by Ursula K. Le Guin, in which therolinguists pore over the manuscripts of ants, the “kinetic sea writings” of penguins and the “delicate, transient lyrics of the lichen.” Perhaps it never will. But what we know so far tethers us to our animal kin regardless. No longer marooned among mindless objects, we have emerged into a remade world, abuzz with the conversations of fellow thinking beings, however inscrutable.","Sonia Shah is a science journalist and the author, most recently, of “The Next Great Migration: The Beauty and Terror of Life on the Move.” She is currently writing a book on the history and science of human exceptionalism.
