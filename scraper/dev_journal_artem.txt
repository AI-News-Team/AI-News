Could not scrape the data for some of the fields in newYorkTimes spider
Tried to use if statements so they would check for different layouts 
and scrape the data for those fields. Didn't work even though the xpath command 
extracted whatever I wanted to get. Will ask for help tomorrow in class

Another thing that was literally was driving me crazy was extracting images
for one layout. I could see the element img in the inspect element but I couldn't 
get it with xpath and it was returning svg that I couldn't find on the page. Some 
magic outside of Hogwarts, idk.

Aardhyn helped me to fix it. It was easier than I thought.... 
just a syntax error
Made a decent progress for the newYorkTimes spider. Reduced the amount of null fields
from 37 to 20. The rest of the layouts were irrelevant to our website, so we decided
to leave them as it is.

Finished polishing New York Times spider and finished doing Fox News spider
Took me some time to figure out why some of the conditions were not triggered 
in my if statement. Was a bit painful to run spider after every change so
I could check if it functions as intended.
Need to sort out categories for BBC and CNN spiders

Got every field extracted for BBC spider. Fixed some of the issues. 
Now it spits a lot of errors that I can't really understand. 
I wish it could be a bit more specific so it would be able to
debug that easier. The list of the errors do not help at all. 
I love to use scrapy :)

Finished doing the categories for all the spiders in the project. 
Glad that it is over. That was a terrible experience to debug 
any error or google how to fix that. Can't wait to start paraphrazing
