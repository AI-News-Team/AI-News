Could not scrape the data for some of the fields in newYorkTimes spider
Tried to use if statements so they would check for different layouts 
and scrape the data for those fields. Didn't work even though the xpath command 
extracted whatever I wanted to get. Will ask for help tomorrow in class

Another thing that was literally was driving me crazy was extracting images
for one layout. I could see the element img in the inspect element but I couldn't 
get it with xpath and it was returning svg that I couldn't find on the page. Some 
magic outside of Hogwarts, idk.

Aardhyn helped me to fix it. It was easier than I thought.... 
just a syntax error
Made a decent progress for the newYorkTimes spider. Reduced the amount of null fields
from 37 to 20. The rest of the layouts were irrelevant to our website, so we decided
to leave them as it is.
