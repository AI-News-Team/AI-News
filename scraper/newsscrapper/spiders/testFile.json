She\u2019s fled to Europe to regain her freedom of speech", "author": "Saskya Vandoorne", "date": "9:25 PM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "Olesya Krivtsova thinks it\u2019s because she was neither the first, nor the last, to criticize the war in Ukraine that she scared Russian authorities as much as she did. Her social media posts were neither particularly strident nor unusual, she told CNN, reflecting those of so many other university students across the country. And that, she believes, is where her troubles started: when her fellow students denounced her to authorities in need of an example. Now in Lithuania and on Moscow\u2019s list of most wanted criminals, the softly spoken, slight 20-year-old from Russia\u2019s northwestern Arkhangelsk region makes for an unlikely villain. But from the start, Russian authorities seemed to have singled her out for harsh punishment with particular zeal. According to OVD-Info , a Russian human rights media group, most\u202fof the 447 Russians prosecuted for anti-war activity since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year\u202fhave been charged with \u201cdisseminating false information.\u201d\u202fBut\u202fKrivtsova was placed under house arrest in January, and banned from using the internet on the far more serious charges of discrediting the Russian army and justifying terrorism. OVD-Info reports 49 people have been charged for discrediting the army and 30 for justifying terrorism. Those charges relate to an Instagram story she posted about the Crimean bridge blast last October, which also criticized Russia for invading Ukraine, and for making an allegedly critical repost of the war in a student chat on the Russian social network VK. Her voice should have remained a little one, she said, but for the repression she faced. \u201cI think they really regretted it. No one expected that the case would grow so much that the resonance would be so huge,\u201d Krivtsova said of the Russian authorities. CNN reported in January on the charges she faced, and other international media outlets have also since covered her story. Russia has significantly cracked down on free speech and opposition as its war in Ukraine has faltered. Days after Putin launched the full-scale invasion, his government adopted a law criminalizing the dissemination of what it called \u201cdeliberately false\u201d information about the Russian armed forces, with a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Putin recently signed new laws that extended those rules to include volunteers and mercenaries participating in the war in Ukraine too. Now, at least, Krivtsova is free to speak as loudly as she wants. \u201cThe question is, am I happy to be here?\u201d she asks from her cramped, dusty, Soviet-era apartment on the outskirts of the Lithuanian capital. \u201cI don\u2019t know, there are two sides to a coin. To some degree I feel I am lucky to be in Vilnius and no longer living where they wanted to put me in jail for the words I spoke.\u201d The turning point came in February, she said, when she celebrated her 20th birthday with her mother, husband, and little sister. She had been arrested for a second time, while she walked to meet her husband for coffee. This time the charges were both trumped up and impossible to escape, she said. Having been falsely accused of having tried to book bus tickets out of Russia, Krivtsova said, she knew she now faced a long stint, possibly years, in a penal colony and had little choice but to flee. \u201cIt was the FSB who forged the court evidence,\u201d Krivtsova alleged, referring to Russia\u2019s security service. \u201cMy lawyer, my mom and I were poring over documents after what happened, gathering evidence to show it wasn\u2019t me who did it, but nobody cared,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized they would all cover each other\u2019s backs because Russia is a police state, and I think this is what made me leave, because I was facing my main trial, but my evidence was not being considered there, either.\u201d She took off in the middle of the night, she said, traveling for days by car to a border she had never imagined she might cross. But Krivtsova acknowledged that things are hard despite her newfound freedom. \u201cI lost a lot and went through a lot,\u201d she said, perched on one of the three rickety chairs that constitute the threadbare apartment furnishings. \u201cNot least, my mother\u2019s tears at the idea of my situation. I lost [left behind] my husband, grandfather, and grandmother. This is a huge price for anyone.\u201d On a more practical note, Krivtsova explained with her characteristic earnest but quiet seriousness, that she is in desperate need of a vacuum cleaner. And that\u2019s just the start of it. Having left with only a backpack, she now needs clothes, a phone and enrollment in a new university. She had to leave her old phone behind for fear of being traced. Before crossing the border, Krivtsova also ditched the electronic bracelet she had to wear around her ankle after she was placed under house arrest. Luckily for her, \u201cits GPS, like so much other Russian hardware, didn\u2019t function properly,\u201d she said, with a mischievous smile. But as she crossed the border out of Russia, Krivtsova said she gained a lot too. Her demeanour lightened at the thought of her new, hard-won freedom of speech. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m already using my voice,\u201d she said, sitting up slightly taller. \u201cI have already created another Instagram channel, in which I continue to publish posts. I think it\u2019s now my daily job to discredit the Russian army because the Russian army is committing crimes on the territory of Ukraine.\u201d And she has no doubt that, back in Moscow, they\u2019ll be listening. After all, that\u2019s why she\u2019s here, she said, \u201cand that\u2019s why the authorities are afraid, because words are the most terrible weapon now.\u201d", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/europe/russian-student-flees-to-lithuania-intl", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230328115616-03-olesya-krivtsova.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "\u2018April is coming at us like a freight train\u2019: Already busy tornado season has meteorologists nervous for peak season", "author": "Haley Brink", "date": "2:41 PM EDT, Mon March 27, 2023", "category": "World", "body": " Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms. It has been an extremely active year in terms of severe weather, with well above normal numbers in terms of tornadoes, and the peak of severe weather season does not begin until this week. The traditional peak for severe storms across the US is April, May, and June, this is also the time when the most tornadoes typically occur. However, in 11 out of the last 13 weeks, severe weather has occurred somewhere in the Lower 48 and more severe storms are forecast later this week. In January and February there were 178 confirmed tornadoes, the fourth most in recorded history, according to preliminary data from the Storm Prediction Center . March has remained very active and is likely to remain above normal in terms of tornadoes. Preliminary data show 296 tornado reports through March 26, which is the highest since 2017. This week we spoke with Bill Bunting, the Chief of Forecast Operations at the Storm Prediction Center, about how intense the severe weather has been in recent months. \u201cThere have been well over a dozen higher end severe events, that\u2019s like enhanced risks, Level 3 of 5 or higher, just since November,\u201d Bunting said. \u201cIt reminds me of some of the more historically active years that we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d He told us the extremely active and wet pattern in the West is certainly related to the extremely active severe storm pattern the eastern US has been experiencing as far as large-scale atmospheric forces. \u201cStorm systems impacting the western US with anomalously high values of moisture resulting in lots of snow, lots of rain, tornadoes in Los Angeles, and as those systems progress east and they maintain their intensity, which too many of them have,\u201d Bunting explained. \u201cThese very strong wind fields, very strong surface cyclones developing can contribute to heightened severe weather potential as those systems get farther east.\u201d While not every storm system pushing inland across the western US results in severe weather in the East, some of the strongest systems can and have. And some areas in the eastern US, such as the South, have been hit hard by severe weather event after severe weather event with very little break in between. \u201cFor our part of the country, that we\u2019re calling the Lower Mississippi Valley, it started back in the fall of 2022,\u201d Michael Berry, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Shreveport, Louisiana told us. \u201cWe had one of our biggest severe weather outbreaks that I can remember in quite some time November 4. We issued two tornado emergencies for four significant tornadoes that impacted high population areas in our area.\u201d The storm systems have been constant since. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so burdened with severe weather so far in February, March, we\u2019re just kind of worried about what April will bring,\u201d Berry said. \u201cApril is coming at us like a freight train. And of course, it always screams severe weather across this part of the country.\u201d Berry tells us April is their region\u2019s normal peak to see severe weather. \u201cAll the right ingredients come together in April to make April typically our worst month for severe weather,\u201d Berry said. \u201cYou have more heating, which leads to more instability, and you always have the moisture here because of our proximity to the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d And unfortunately, sea surface temperatures across the Gulf of Mexico are currently above normal with some areas seeing temperatures as high as the upper 70s. But it is just one ingredient, and several are needed for a severe weather event to materialize. If the weather pattern remains active, like it has been so far this year, there could still be several more weeks of severe weather ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s like making a cake, all the ingredients are there, the forcing aloft, the instability due to heating and the moisture source,\u201d Berry said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect ingredients for severe weather.\u201d For those living and working in the storm-fatigued South, Bunting had some words of advice: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to provide advance heads-up days into the future and it\u2019s just really important to monitor the forecast. If you don\u2019t have a severe weather plan, now\u2019s the time to put one together and be ready to do it when warnings are issued for your area.\u201d CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray contributed to this report.", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/27/weather/severe-storm-peak-tornado-season-april-wxn", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230327090642-01-weather-newsletter-monday-032723.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "A baby and her father are among dozens killed in the storm-ravaged South.

From Houston to South Carolina, more than 20 million people are at risk of severe storms Monday. \u201cLarge hail, damaging wind gusts, and frequent lightning will remain the primary risks throughout the day today but isolated tornadoes could still be possible,\u201d CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink said. There\u2019s also a threat of dangerous flooding throughout the region. \u201cDue to the repeated rounds of heavy rainfall over the weekend and today, bouts of heavy rainfall could lead to instances of flash flooding across the Southeast,\u201d Brink said. Parts of the South repeatedly walloped by recent storms have seen 4 to 6 inches of rain over the last few days \u2013 and could get deluged with another 1 to 3 inches Monday.

Ethan Herndon and his 1-year-old daughter Riley were killed when their mobile home was struck by a tornado that hit Mississippi on Friday night, family member Walter Edington said. The family learned Ethan was dead but Riley was still missing, Edington said. \u201cSo about a dozen of us went over there to help look for the baby,\u201d he said. Around 2:30 a.m. Saturday, a first responder told the family that Riley had been found dead, Edington said. The baby\u2019s mother, Herndon\u2019s wife Elizabeth, suffered a broken arm, a broken leg and a dislocated hip, Edington said. The couple\u2019s two other children were also injured but survived the tornado that devastated the community of Wren. The National Weather Service in Memphis rated the tornado that hit Wren and nearby Amory as an EF-3 tornado \u2013 with estimated wind gusts between 136 and 165 mph. Herndon was a Navy veteran and worked at a RV dealership to support his family, Edington said. Elizabeth Herndon dedicated her time to taking care of Riley, who had been born prematurely and had several health issues, Edington said. \u201cThey were really devoted to their daughter, Riley. She was the center of their home,\u201d Edington said. \u201cThe family has been through a lot previously. I have a lot of respect for them. They are emotionally and physically shattered.\u201d Edington started a verified GoFundMe to help with the family\u2019s recovery. \u201cThey have suffered the most painful and terrifying loss any of us can imagine, and their needs are obvious and great,\u201d Edington wrote on the fundraiser\u2019s page. The South has suffered an onslaught of destructive weather since the weekend. At least 10 confirmed tornadoes struck Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee on Friday night, according to storm surveys by various weather service offices. President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration for parts of Mississippi on Sunday. Over the weekend, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency had given a death toll of 25, but it reduced that number Monday, confirming three storm-related deaths in Carroll County, three deaths in Humphreys County, two deaths in Monroe County and 13 deaths in Sharkey County for a total of 21 fatalities. Malary White, the agency\u2019s chief communications officer, told CNN \u201cnumbers can be fluid,\u201d when asked about the deaths. Alabama reported one death as a result of the storms. In Rolling Fork, Mississippi \u2013 home to about 2,000 people \u2013 an especially violent tornado obliterated houses, businesses and city buildings. \u201cHomes have been totally demolished,\u201d Rolling Fork Vice Mayor LaDonna Sias told CNN on Monday. She said her own home was also destroyed. Sias and her husband survived by hiding in a closet just before the EF-4 tornado \u2013 with estimated wind gusts of 166 to 200 mph \u2013 shredded their house. \u201cHe pushed me in \u2026 his closet, and he was able to close the door,\u201d Sias said. \u201cAnd the minute he closed the door, the force \u2026 he was just constantly trying to hold the door so it wouldn\u2019t come open. And you could literally hear the house ripping apart.\u201d Despite the loss of her own home, Sias said she\u2019s focused on helping other residents \u2013 including those who have lost loved ones. \u201cThe hardest part is having to witness someone that has lost a loved one and then having to talk to people that were residents here but have been displaced due to this disaster,\u201d Sias said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s overwhelming. And it\u2019s heart-wrenching.\u201d Search and recovery efforts were still underway in Mississippi on Sunday as emergency personnel also worked to distribute critical resources, including bottled water, portable restrooms, batteries and fuel, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said. Some Rolling Fork neighborhoods and businesses were so badly hit there was \u201cnot any immediate shelter anywhere\u201d on Sunday, Sharkey County District 1 Supervisor Bill Newsom told CNN. \u201cEveryone is affected. Entire subdivisions and neighborhoods \u2026 some are just wiped away, they\u2019re just not even there,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt looks like a battle zone.\u201d The vice mayor said she is the most concerned about finding support for the families who have lost loved ones and are facing \u201ctotal devastation.\u201d \u201cWe need to make sure that those people that are displaced, that no longer have any type of structure \u2013 they need immediate housing. They need some kind of assistance,\u201d Sias said. Teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been deployed to Mississippi, and the agency will work with state officials to find interim housing for those impacted, the Department of Homeland Security said. Resident David Brown\u2019s parents, Melissa and Lonnie Pierce, were both killed Friday when a tractor-trailer was picked up by the tornado and thrown on top of their home, CNN affiliate WAPT reported. \u201cWords can\u2019t express how I\u2019m feeling. I don\u2019t know \u2013 broken,\u201d Brown told WAPT. Brown said his son could have been in the home if he had not picked him up before the storm. His family spent the weekend sifting through the crushed residence, searching for any salvageable reminder of his parents. \u201cHonestly, if I can find anything in the rubble,\u201d he said, \u201cit would mean more than anything.\u201d The National Weather Service in Atlanta has clarified that the Heads Creek Dam in central Georgia has not failed, citing Spalding County emergency management officials. \u201cThere has not been any failure or breach of the Heads Creek Reservoir in Spalding County. We are only experiencing overflow from the excessive rainfall and activating the Emergency Action Plan out of an abundance of precaution,\u201d the weather service office in Atlanta said Monday. A flash flood emergency is still in place. The weather service said it is coordinating with state and local officials and communicating the potential flood threat in the area. \u201cBecause the Emergency Action Plan was activated, using the word \u2018imminent\u2019 and not \u2018potential\u2019 failure, the FF Emergency was used,\u201d the weather service said. Previously the weather service had said a flash flood emergency was in place for areas downstream from Heads Creek Reservoir in western Spalding County after a dam failed, citing a local emergency manager. Another tornado destroyed dozens of homes Sunday in LaGrange, Georgia, Troup County Emergency Management Director Zachary Steele said. And many as 100 homes were damaged in the western Georgia city.

Up to 3 inches of rain have fallen over the central California coast, and more is one the way Wednesday. Up to 4 feet snow is likely in the northern coastal mountain ranges and the Sierra by Wednesday. A slight, Level 2 of 4, risk for excessive rainfall remains across the central California coast through early Wednesday morning, with the expectation the risk will weaken throughout the day. At this time in a normal year, this type of atmospheric river storm would bring beneficial precipitation to the region. But given the unprecedented amount of rain and snow California has already received over a prolonged period, the storm will exacerbate flooding issues, bring down weakened trees and add more snow to already record levels. Cities including Oakland and Monterey are on track to hit records for rain in March by the end of this week. \u201cPreceding storms have saturated soils which will result in trees coming down and the potential for more power outages,\u201d National Weather Service meteorologist Roger Gass told CNN. \u201cWe still have road closures in the mountainous areas because of the sheer number of landslides and rockslides since we have been impacted by so many storm systems,\u201d Gass said. The impacts of this storm are further complicated by strong winds. Nearly four million people were under a wind advisory in California and Oregon with gusts expected up to 55 mph Wednesday. Because of the strong winds, near whiteout conditions are possible in parts of Northern California near Mount Shasta, where 1 to 3 feet of snow could fall. Winter storm warnings are in effect for this region and other parts of California through Wednesday. Sections of Interstate 5 running from California into Oregon were closed Tuesday due to \u201csevere winter conditions,\u201d according to a tweet from the Oregon Department of Transportation. I-5 northbound is closed from Redding, California, to the border, ODOT said. Southbound traffic is closed from Ashland, Oregon, to the border. \u201cThis could be a long closure until conditions in CA improve,\u201d the agency said. Statewide, the snowpack in California for the Sierras is currently at 228% of its normal amount for this time of year and this storm will only increase that margin. The Southern Sierras specifically have reached record levels, while the Central Sierra likely will by the end of the winter season. In response to the severe weather, California Gov. Gavin Newsom requested a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration and expanded the state of emergency to include additional counties impacted by storms that started in late February, his office said in a news release on Tuesday. The declaration request would help response and recovery for the counties of Calaveras, Kern, Los Angeles, Mariposa, Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Tulare, and Tuolumne, the release said. The governor also added Alameda, Marin, Modoc and Shasta counties to the state of emergency already covering 43 other counties, according to the news release.

While this system may not have as extreme rainfall totals as we have seen with past atmospheric river events, huge impacts could still be felt simply because the soil is so saturated from the unprecedented winter. Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s rain could bring the possibility of additional flooding across the state. The Weather Prediction Center has issued a marginal risk of flooding for the areas impacted by this system. \u201cRainfall rates may briefly peak at 0.25-0.5\u201d/hr while relatively quick moving across the southern part of the Marginal Risk, but saturated soils could support a localized flooding/rapid runoff threat,\u201d the prediction center said.

Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort in California\u2019s Eastern Sierra announced that it broke a record for its snowiest season, recording 695 inches at the main lodge as of Wednesday. The previous record, set in 2010, was 668 inches. This comes after the resort announced last week that it would be staying open through the end of July given the unprecedented amount of snow. Amounts as high as 870 inches have been observed at the mountain\u2019s summit. Gusty winds could lead to potential power outages as winds are forecast to gust as high as 50 mph with this storm system. High winds will extend far inland as well, impacting the Great Basin, Desert Southwest and southern Rockies as this storm pushes east. \u201cThese high winds are forecast to continue into the Southern Rockies Thursday, with gusts upwards of 70 mph possible,\u201d the prediction center warned. The storm will move out of California by Thursday evening, leaving much cooler and drier conditions in place through the rest of the week.

One of the most innovative new features: a chin strap that links the two ends of the C-shaped pillow, so you can rest your chin and avoid head drops while sleeping (a great way to eliminate the chance of neck pain when you wake up). The pillow also boasts a seat strap that allows you to attach it to any seat, and a fully customizable fit helps keep your spine aligned, while raised side supports help stabilize your noggin. Also included? A compact travel case and ear plugs for a sound slumber. You can buy Cabeau\u2019s TNE S3: The Neck\u2019s Evolution direct from the brand\u2019s site or on Amazon in six colorways \u2014 all named after a different international city \u2014 right now.", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/travel/cabeau-tne-s3-the-necks-evolution", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323122919-cabeau-tne-s3-cnnu.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "Meet the titanosaur: Dinosaur giant goes on display in Europe for the first time", "author": "Tom Page", "date": "2:36 PM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": ["Patagotitan mayorum, a giant dinosaur and possibly the largest ever to have walked the Earth, goes on display for the first time in Europe at London's Natural History Museum on March 31.

Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. House-cured meat and handmade pasta, a three-course American menu where French techniques shine and a seasonally inspired eight-course tasting menu are among the offerings from the nominees for one of the culinary world\u2019s highest honors \u2014 the James Beard Awards. The James Beard Foundation announced the finalists for the 2023 Restaurant and Chef Awards on Wednesday in Nashville. The winners in the restaurant and chef categories will be revealed on June 5 during a ceremony at the Lyric Opera in Chicago. For many in the industry, the recognition comes on the heels of several challenging years. \u201cIt was a horrible last few years, and it was very difficult for restaurants and we all did the best we could. And I think we\u2019re all kind of shell-shocked and grateful to still be here,\u201d said Jennifer Uygur, who co-owns Outstanding Restaurant nominee Lucia in Dallas with her husband, chef David Uygur. Uygur said the category her restaurant was nominated in is especially meaningful in light of tough times during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI think the coolest thing about this one is that it\u2019s for Outstanding Restaurant, and it\u2019s the whole team \u2026 we can\u2019t do it without front of the house, back of the house, everybody, to make the whole experience.\u201d That sense of teamwork was echoed by the owners of Copine, a Seattle restaurant that turns out contemporary American cuisine using classical French techniques. \u201cYou just realize community and staff is really everything,\u201d said Jill Kinney, who runs Copine with her husband, chef Shaun McCrain. \u201cI mean you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d Lucia and Copine are joined by three more finalists in the Outstanding Restaurant category: Coracora in West Hartford, Connecticut, Friday Saturday Sunday in Philadelphia and Mita\u2019s in Cincinnati. Finalists were named across more than 20 categories, including the new Award for Outstanding Bakery. Two bakeries in Texas \u2014 La Casita Bakeshop in Richardson and Kuluntu Bakery in Dallas \u2014 are among the five finalists in that category. \u201cThe James Beard Awards celebrate outstanding achievement and exceptional culinary talent, as well as all those doing incredible work on behalf of our communities and wider food system. This year\u2019s nominees, winners and honorees are inspiring exemplars of that,\u201d said Clare Reichenbach, CEO of the James Beard Foundation. Last year\u2019s awards marked the first bestowed under new policies and procedures and a new code of ethics sparked by allegations of chefs\u2019 bad behavior and a lack of diversity. Many in the industry hope restaurant culture is changing, too. Chad Williams, chef at Outstanding Restaurant finalist Friday Saturday Sunday, said in an interview Wednesday that there is an opportunity for leaders to think about what they went through coming up the ranks, \u201cand making sure other people don\u2019t have to necessarily go through that.\u201d \u201cI came up in Michelin-star kitchens and \u2026 they were aggressive and much of what made them great was not the attitudes that were pushed there \u2026 there\u2019s other ways to do it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAs we try to maintain our reputation and put out great food, there\u2019s also people behind that who you have to take care of.\u201d The awards in many key categories were abruptly called off in 2020 and remained on pause in 2021 amid the industry\u2019s pandemic upheaval and the foundation\u2019s work on the new framework. In 2023, the structure of the voting body has been tweaked, combining scouting and tasting duties for the judges. The nonprofit James Beard Foundation was established more than 30 years ago, shortly after \u201cpioneer foodie\u201d James Beard\u2019s death, \u201cto celebrate, support and elevate the people behind America\u2019s food culture.\u201d The first awards ceremony was held in 1991. Beard was the host of \u201cI Love to Eat,\u201d the first food program on network television in 1946 and was called the \u201cDean of American Cookery\u201d by The New York Times in 1954.

Israel\u2019s Histadrut trade union which coordinated the strike said that some government ministries, the country\u2019s three biggest cities, banks, ports and many other companies and agencies were on strike on Monday and added that essential services such as hospitals and firefighters were to operate on a Saturday schedule. All takeoffs from Israel\u2019s main airport, Ben Gurion Tel Aviv, were halted for several hours because of the strike. Workers at the country\u2019s largest port in Haifa stopped working, some universities were shuttered and some of the country\u2019s best-known retailers, including McDonald\u2019s and the shopping mall chain Azrieli Group, announced closures. Several Israeli embassies including the ones in Washington DC, London and Paris, were closed on Monday after their workers and some diplomats joined the strike. Massive crowds filled the streets of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv late Sunday night after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul. Massive spontaneous protests took over the Israeli city of Tel Aviv late Sunday night in response to the Gallant news, with people waving Israeli flags and chanting \u201cdemocracy.\u201d Protesters lit several fires on the main highway in the city and blocked number of streets and bridges, including the Ayalon Highway. Despite reports in Israeli media that Netanyahu would speak on Monday, his only comments since he fired Gallant came in a short tweet in which he urged protesters to \u201cbehave responsibly.\u201d \u201cI call on all the demonstrators in Jerusalem, on the right and the left, to behave responsibly and not to act violently. We are brotherly people,\u201d he said on Twitter. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been protesting for months against the planned judicial changes which would give the governing parties more control over Israel\u2019s judiciary. Israel\u2019s former Prime Minister Yair Lapid urged Netanyahu to reverse the decision to fire Gallant, calling the move a \u201cnew low.\u201d He wrote on Twitter that Netanyahu might be able to fire the minister but \u201ccannot fire the people of Israel who are standing up to the insanity of the coalition.\u201d In a statement issued later, Lapid called the past 24 hours \u201cmadness,\u201d \u201closs of control\u201d and \u201closs of direction.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve never been closer to falling apart. Our national security is at risk, our economy is crumbling, our foreign relations are at their lowest point ever, we don\u2019t know what to say to our children about their future in this country. We have been taken hostage by a bunch of extremists with no brakes and no boundaries,\u201d he said. Gallant argued for a halt to the judicial reforms in a speech Saturday night, when Netanyahu was out of the country on an official visit to the United Kingdom. Some military reservists have pledged to pull out of their service in opposition to the plans, which critics say would undermine the independence of the judiciary. Gallant said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel\u2019s security. His ouster and the mass protests that followed prompted a string of prominent officials to call for a halt to the judicial reform process. In a Facebook post on Monday, Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog called on Netanyahu and his government to immediately pause the plans, saying \u201cthe eyes of the whole world are on you.\u201d \u201cDeep concern hovers over the entire nation. Security, economy, society \u2013 everyone is threatened,\u201d Herzog said in the statement. \u201cThe eyes of all the people of Israel are on you. The eyes of all the Jewish people are on you. The eyes of the whole world are on you. For the sake of the unity of Israelis, for the sake of committed responsibility I call on you to halt the legislative procedure immediately.\u201d Separately, more than two dozen mayors from across Israel declared hunger strike over judicial overhaul on Monday. Moshe Fadlon, the mayor of the coastal city of Herzliya, posted a statement saying: \u201cStarting tomorrow morning, [we] are launching a hunger strike in Jerusalem opposite the prime minister\u2019s office, demanding an end to the huge crisis and the disaster that Israel is hurtling towards, to prevent the security of the country being affected and for the sake of togetherness and unity of the country.\u201d The statement was signed by 27 officials, representing a broad spectrum of local authorities across the country. Amid the protests, Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from his own party. As protesters gathered into the early hours of Monday, Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar and Diaspora Affairs and Social Equality Minister Amichai Chikli \u2013 all members of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party \u2013 also suggested that Netanyahu should stop the legislation. Barkat, a former mayor of Jerusalem,  suggested Netanyahu should \u201cstop and recalculate\u201d his overhaul plan, warning it has brought the country to the brink of civil war. \u201cThe reform is necessary and we will do it \u2013 but not at the cost of a civil war,\u201d he said. Even some of the most forceful proponents of the reform appeared to be softening their stance. Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who has strongly advocated for the reform to be pushed through, opened the door to the possibility of a delay on Monday. \u201cI will respect any decision that Prime Minister Netanyahu makes regarding legal reform legislative procedures,\u201d Levin, who is a member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, said. \u201cThis is with the knowledge that a situation in which everyone does what he feels like, may immediately lead to the fall of the government and the collapse of the Likud,\u201d he said. In his speech on Saturday, Gallant said the pause was needed \u201cfor the security of Israel,\u201d citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest at the government plans. Gallant reiterated that sentiment in a tweet on Sunday after his dismissal: \u201cThe security of the State of Israel has always been and will always remain the mission of my life.\u201d Under the proposals, the government would have control over the appointment of judges, and parliament would gain the power to override Supreme Court decisions. The government argues the changes are essential to rein in the Supreme Court, which they see as insular, elitist, and no longer representative of the Israeli people. Opponents say the plans threaten the foundations of Israeli democracy. Israel\u2019s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir had called on Netanyahu to fire Gallant after his speech on Saturday. \u201cGallant gave in tonight to blackmail and threats from all those anarchists who call for resistance and use the [Israel Defense Forces] as a bargaining tool,\u201d Gvir tweeted. Part of the bill \u2013 which effectively strips the courts of the power to declare a prime minister unfit for office \u2013 has already been pushed through.  Critics say Netanyahu is pushing through the changes because of his own ongoing corruption trial; Netanyahu denies this.

Mikati\u2019s plan to postpone Daylight Saving until April 20 (following the Muslim holy month of Ramadan), rather than introducing it on March 25, was rejected by several churches and media organizations, and caused chaos in a population that woke up to two different timezones. However, the Lebanese leader said his government had since voted to adopt Daylight Saving time starting on Wednesday night into Thursday, adding that the decision was taken after \u201ccalm discussions.\u201d \u201cWe had to take a period of 48 hours to put this into effect, in order to deal with some technical matters that have arisen as a result of (the) last announcement,\u201d Mikati said. \u201cLet us be clear. The problem is not a matter of summer or winter timings \u2026 the problem is the gap in the presidency in the first place. As prime minister, I do not hold any responsibility for this gap,\u201d Mikati said. Lebanon is gripped by a political deadlock that has prevented parliament from electing a president since former leader Michel Aoun left his post in October, after he presided over a catastrophic economic meltdown and a deadly Beirut port blast. Mikati said that his initial decision to postpone winter clock changes was \u201cintended to relieve those fasting in the month of Ramadan for an hour, without causing any harm to any other Lebanese factions.\u201d \u201cSome considered this decision a challenge to them, and gave it a dimension I had never imagined. I certainly did not make the decision with the intention of being sectarian or religious.\u201d The government initially did not give a direct explanation for the move, although local media suggested it was introduced to line up with Ramadan, when Muslims abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset. In some cases the debate took on a sectarian nature. Politics in Lebanon is sharply sectarian, with seats in parliament allocated by religion. The decision prompted widespread revolt, with two TV channels going ahead with the clock changes in protest. Some Lebanese also found the funny side of the episode. A clip circulating on social media showed a digital clock at Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport displaying two different times; on one side the clock flashes with the time of 10:05, the other side shows 9:05.

After Netanyahu\u2019s announcement, Arnon Bar-David, the leader of the Histadrut labor union, announced that a general strike, which swept the nation on Monday, would now be called off. \u201cThe general strike stops from this moment,\u201d Bar-David told CNN affiliate Channel 13. But he warned Netanyahu against reviving the legislation. \u201cIf the prime minister returns to aggressive legislation he\u2019ll find us facing him. Legislation without consent will be met with a general strike.\u201d It was unclear whether Netanyahu\u2019s partial climbdown would end the roiling anger on the streets. \u201cThe protests will continue unless Netanyahu will note publicly that he was mistaken when leading that reform, and (that) he is holding all future motivations to renew the judicial reform,\u201d Tamir Hayman,  managing director of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), told CNN . \u201cThis is the only scenario where we will see a complete stop of all the demonstrations,\u201d said Hayman, a former head of the Israeli Intelligence Directorate. Nonetheless, key Israeli allies welcomed Netanyahu\u2019s announcement. For the US, the delay represents \u201can opportunity to create additional time and space for compromise,\u201d said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly also hailed the decision and his country\u2019s relationship with Israel. \u201cIt is vital that the shared democratic values that underpin that relationship are upheld, and a robust system of checks and balances are preserved,\u201d said Cleverly. However concerns have been raised over the terms of the deal Netanyahu struck with his coalition partners. Earlier Monday, the far-right Jewish Power party revealed that the deal to delay the legislation would involve the creation of a National Guard controlled by party leader and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak told CNN that the move is a \u201clunatic step\u201d due to Ben Gvir\u2019s lengthy criminal record, which includes a conviction for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. The original proposals would have amounted to the most sweeping overhaul of the Israeli legal system since the country\u2019s founding. The most significant changes would allow a simple majority in the Knesset to overturn Supreme Court rulings; the Netanyahu government also sought to change the way judges are selected, and remove government ministries\u2019 independent legal advisers, whose opinions are binding. But months of sustained protests over the plans drew global attention and rocked the country. The political crisis deepened on Sunday when Netanyahu\u2019s office announced the firing of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a one-line statement, after he became the first member of the cabinet to call for a pause to the controversial plans. In the hours that followed, Israeli society ground to a halt as anger at the bill mounted. Netanyahu was also condemned by his opponents and a host of former Israeli prime ministers. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been closer to falling apart. Our national security is at risk, our economy is crumbling, our foreign relations are at their lowest point ever, we don\u2019t know what to say to our children about their future in this country. We have been taken hostage by a bunch of extremists with no brakes and no boundaries,\u201d former Prime Minister Yair Lapid said at the Knesset. As he fought to push ahead with his effort last week, Netanyahu\u2019s government also passed a law making it harder to oust prime ministers that was condemned by critics as a self-preservation tactic. By a 61-to-47 final vote, the Knesset approved the bill that states that only the prime minister himself or the cabinet, with a two-thirds majority, can declare the leader unfit. The cabinet vote would then need to be ratified by a super majority in the parliament.

During his speech, Netanyahu also reiterated his criticism of the refusal by some reservists to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. The prime minister had earlier fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over his opposition to the planned overhaul. \u201cThe state of Israel cannot continue with people who refuse to serve in the army,\u201d he the prime minister said. \u201cRefusing is the end of our country.\u201d Hayman, from the INSS, said the protests may pose a security threat as some within the military begin to divide into camps for and against the judicial overhaul.

Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s land forces, said on his Telegram channel Thursday that \u201c[Russians] are losing significant forces [in Bakhmut] and are running out of energy.\u201d \u201cVery soon, we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we did in the past near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliya and Kupyansk,\u201d he said. His comments come days after Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky made a surprise trip to the front lines of the Donetsk region, and will raise hopes in the West that Kyiv\u2019s contentious decision to keep troops in Bakhmut will pay dividends. A counter-offensive has seemed an unlikely prospect for several weeks, as forces from Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group bombarded Bakhmut and edged closer toward seizing control of the city. But that effort has come at a considerable cost to manpower and resources, and now appears to have slowed. Russian troops have launched more than 200 strikes on the area in the past 24 hours alone but are losing hundreds of men each day in their efforts, the spokesman for the Eastern Grouping of the Armed Forces, Serhii Cherevatyi, said later on Thursday. CNN is unable to verify those figures. Cherevatyi said another area that was seeing intense fire was to the northeast of Bakhmut, on the front line running north from the town of Kreminna. Speaking on Ukrainian television Friday, Cherevatyi said that \u201cIt is not that [Wagner] are withdrawing, but that due to heavy losses they have to be reinforced by units of the regular army of the Russian Federation, primarily by airborne troops.\u201d He added that Russian forces in the area are \u201cmaking several dozen attacks every day. There were 32 firefights over the last day,\u201d in and around Bakhmut. There were also air strikes launched by both fixed-wing planes and attack helicopters, he said, but added that \u201cartillery is a much bigger factor of influence on military operations there than aviation.\u201d On Thursday, the Ukrainian National Resistance Center \u2013 an official body \u2013 said that Wagner mercenaries had begun deporting residents of the Bakhmut suburbs they control. \u201cMilitants forcefully take local residents to captured areas of Luhansk region, where they are filtered. After that, they are deported to Perm (Russia) and other remote regions of the Russian Federation,\u201d the Center said. \u201cLocals are deported under the intention of evacuation. After that, they are assimilated in remote areas of the empire, because they are now dependent on the occupiers.\u201d The Center\u2019s claim could not be verified. The optimism of land forces commander Syrskyi reflected a Wednesday update from the the Ukrainian military\u2019s General Staff, which said in a statement that while Bakhmut is still expected to see heavy fighting, Russia\u2019s \u201coffensive potential is decreasing\u201d there. \u201cThe enemy keeps trying to take the city, losing a significant amount of manpower, weapons and military equipment,\u201d it said on Wednesday. Western intelligence strikes a similar tone. \u201cThe tempo of Russian operations around Bakhmut appears to be slowing,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank wrote in its Wednesday update on the conflict. But that shift may also indicate a change in Russia\u2019s priorities. \u201cThere is a realistic possibility that the Russian assault on the town is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, partially because some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors,\u201d the British Ministry of Defence said Wednesday. Zelensky handed out awards to troops defending Bakhmut during a morale-boosting trip on Wednesday. \u201cIt is an honor for me to support our warriors who are defending the country in the toughest frontline conditions,\u201d he later said in his nightly address. The lengthy resistance of Ukrainian troops could yet vindicate his decision to ignore some Western calls to tactically retreat from Bakhmut as the Russian offensive closed in. \u201cThis is tactical for us,\u201d Zelensky told CNN earlier this month, laying out his decision-making and insisting that Kyiv\u2019s military brass was united in prolonging its defense of the city. \u201cWe understand that after Bakhmut they could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk, they could go to Sloviansk, it would be open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine, in the Donetsk direction,\u201d he said. A city 20 kilometers west of Bakhmut is also being struck with increasing frequency by Russian missiles, Ukrainian authorities said Friday.

She barely flinched. Russian positions are just across the Dnipro River and Kherson , a city in southern Ukraine, is under regular attack. Like many Ukrainians during this war, Olena prefers not to share her last name. She has worked at the orphanage for more than 17 years. Olena said she loved all the children at the home, but she was closest to Arkasha. \u201cOf course, everyone has their favorite, but he was mine,\u201d she said. Five-year-old Arkasha\u2019s locker is orange \u2013 with a sticker of a rooster on it. His name is neatly printed in Cyrillic script. Inside the rooms, there are paintings of bunnies holding balloons, floating through the sky; play areas for toddlers; cupboards stacked with toys. In the bedrooms, sparkling clean cots and tiny bunk beds with brightly colored mattresses. But the 48 children who lived here are gone \u2013 seized by Russian officials during the city\u2019s months-long occupation. \u201cI feel emptiness, emptiness. Everything has stopped,\u201d said Olena. \u201cThe children were happy. They had everything!\u201d When the war began in February last year, the staff at the children\u2019s home came up with a plan. They spirited all the children, mostly under 5, to the Holhofa church on the other side of town, Olena recounted. The church and caregivers from the home kept the children safe and warm in the basement. They hid them to keep them safe from the fighting and to escape the Russians, said Olena. Kherson fell to the Russian forces in the early days of the war. The invading troops moved swiftly over the Dnipro River; it was the first major city to be taken and the only regional capital. \u201cYes, the children were here,\u201d Victor, the 74-year-old caretaker of the church, told CNN. \u201cBut after the Russians occupied this city, they started asking questions.\u201d After a few weeks, he said, agents from Russia\u2019s security service, the FSB, came to the church and demanded that the caregivers transport the children back to the orphanage. The caregivers felt they didn\u2019t have a choice. And it was then that Olena realized that the Russians wanted to take the children away. \u201cThey kept saying, \u2018these are our children,\u2019\u201d she said of the FSB agents. In October, Russian officials informed the orphanage that they were coming for the children. \u201cThey warned us to collect their clothes. The Russians called in the evening and said we should prepare the children for the next morning. The buses arrived at eight,\u201d she said. Just over a week ago, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children\u2019s Rights, saying they were criminally responsible for the \u201cunlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.\u201d The Kremlin condemned the ICC decision. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently said at least 15,000 children had been taken out of Ukraine. Rights groups say many of them were coerced into leaving their parents and taken to so-called summer camps. In occupied Kherson, the Russians didn\u2019t hide their actions in taking the children from the Kherson Children\u2019s Home. In fact, they widely advertised the move and used it for propaganda purposes. Eventually, the incident could be used as evidence in a war crimes trial. Shared on Telegram, the footage of that October morning shows bewildered children being shunted onto buses \u2013 away from their beloved nurses. Olena said the nurses wrote the children\u2019s names on their jackets or on their hands \u2013 so that at least they would be called by their real name wherever they went. The organizers said they were taking them to occupied Crimea. It\u2019s not clear exactly where they ended up. Ukrainian investigators have said orphans taken from occupied territory also ended up in Russia, where they were given citizenship and handed to Russian couples. \u201cThey do not deserve our children. They should bring them back. They do not deserve them,\u201d said Olena. The Russians didn\u2019t stop with the orphanages, they scoured Kherson for children to take. Collaborators and Russian officials came repeatedly to the Kherson Regional Children\u2019s Hospital asking for a list of orphaned babies and children that should be taken, said Dr. Olha Piliarska, a pediatric anesthetist. According to Piliarska, staff at the hospital hid some orphans in the ICU basement and faked medical records for other children, indicating conditions including convulsions and fluid on the lungs. She showed CNN a ventilator like the one in which they put a healthy baby, she said, and turned on some lights to make it appear that it could not be moved safely. They were all terrified that they would be found out, she recalled. Piliarksa and hospital administrators say they managed to save 15 children \u2013 three were taken away by Russian officials. \u201cWe understood that they would not forgive us for this. We knew that there would be a serious retribution,\u201d she said. One nurse at the hospital took such efforts to thwart the Russians\u2019 actions a step further. Tetiana Pavelko kept going back to see a newborn called Kira, who\u2019d won her heart. \u201cFrom the beginning, I really loved her. She was such a beautiful child,\u201d she told CNN. Pavelko begged the hospital doctors and administrators to keep Kira off the list of children that collaborators regularly checked. \u201cEvery day, the list was updated. And they made that list twice a day. I made sure that Kira was never on that list,\u201d she recalled. When Ukrainian soldiers took back Kherson from the Russians in November, Pavelko was allowed to take Kira home. She has started adoption proceedings, she said. She, her partner and Kira live in a single-story house in Korabelny district, on the southern edge of Kherson. The neighborhood faces regular shelling from Russians across the river.

still trying to unravel", "author": "Sophie Tanno", "date": "3:58 AM EDT, Sat March 25, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "An extremist and until recently almost unheard-of network in Germany is back in the spotlight after police carried out nationwide raids against it. The Reichsb\u00fcrger movement \u2013 made up of small groups and individuals spread across the country \u2013 peddles a number of bizarre views and rejects the legitimacy of the state. In December last year, 25 people were arrested on suspicion of plotting to attack Germany\u2019s parliament building, overthrow its constitutional order and install the group\u2019s central figure \u2013 aristocrat Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss \u2013 as leader. Raids linked to the group continued this week, with German officials on Thursday saying they had placed one person who was a suspected member and supporter under formal arrest after a police offer was shot and wounded on Wednesday. Germany\u2019s Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said the shooting \u201cshows how dangerous the missions are. It is the duty of the authorities to disarm Reichsb\u00fcrger.\u201d As the crackdown continues, CNN takes a look at what exactly the movement is and the danger it poses. The movement\u2019s adherents have a range of beliefs, including that modern Germany is not a sovereign state and should therefore be rejected as a legitimate form of government. Some believe that the German Empire of 1871 still exists while others want to bring back Hitler\u2019s Third Reich. Many subscribe to right-wing, populist, antisemitic and Nazi ideologies. Werner Patzelt, a political scientist and former professor at TU Dresden , believes the Reichsb\u00fcrger is less of a \u201cmovement\u201d but rather \u201ca loosely coupled network of political stupids who believe that, or at least behave as if, the Federal Republic of Germany does not exist.\u201d \u201cThey claim that Germany is still an occupied country under US control, or a business enterprise registered in Frankfurt,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cFrom such fictitious \u2018facts\u2019 they derive both a \u2018right\u2019 not to pay taxes and penalties, or to establish \u2018provisional political authorities.\u2019 \u201cMuch of this is operetta-like. In some cases, however, criminal energy goes hand in hand with political nonsense, leading to attacks on financial or police officers.\u201d Followers refuse to cooperate with the German state in a number of ways including not paying taxes or choosing to print their own currency and identity cards. Tobias Ginsburg is a German journalist who reported undercover on Germany\u2019s far-right scene. \u201cYou meet people there of all walks of life,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cI met the stereotypes, but also normal people, the dentist from downtown, someone working with the tax revenue service, just normal people. Some had no idea what they had entered.\u201d He thinks that authorities stepping in to prevent last year\u2019s coup attempt is the \u201cbare minimum\u201d that can be done to tackle a wider issue of far-right extremism in Germany. Ginsburg said that large parts of the German population had the perception of the Reichsb\u00fcrger \u201cthat these are loonies, these are old people, or even a Prince - - he seems strange \u2013 and the question that everyone is asking could they have been successful, but this is not the question.\u201d The \u201croyal\u201d concerned is 71-year-old Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss , one of the group\u2019s alleged ringleaders. The prince is a descendant of the House of Reuss, the former rulers of parts of eastern Germany, and now works as a real estate entrepreneur, according to CNN affiliate NTV. \u201cWhat we need to see as society and what our politicians need to understand is that the problem is not some so-called Reichsb\u00fcrger, the problem is far-right ideology getting more and more people to act upon their beliefs,\u201d Ginsburg adds. According to government data, there are about 23,000 Reichsb\u00fcrger members, up from 19,000 in 2019. Of these, an estimated 1,250 people are associated with the right-wing extremist scene. Ginsburg believes the official figures are \u201cconservative,\u201d saying many members choose not to make their affiliation public. The group gained prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw a significant rise in conspiracy theories in Germany, especially relating to the Reichsb\u00fcrger and QAnon groups , according to research published by the Global Network on Extremism and Terror. The Reichsb\u00fcrger movement\u2019s ideologies, including the refusal to follow restrictions imposed by the German state, found common cause among Covid-19 deniers and anti-lockdown protesters. Such ideologies were peddled by the Querdenker organization \u2013 the largest Covid-19 deniers\u2019 movement in Germany. Querdenker organized large demonstrations to protest against Covid-19 measures mandated by the state, with symbols of the Reichsb\u00fcrger and QAnon groups often displayed at such rallies. Germany\u2019s Interior Ministry gave a damning assessment of the movement in a statement to CNN, describing adherents not as \u201charmless nutcases\u201d but rather \u201cdangerous extremists who are driven by violent fantasies and possess a lot of weapons.\u201d The group\u2019s firearms stockpile has left authorities particularly concerned. Latest government figures show that around 400 members own weapons.  Since 2016, 1,100 people have had their weapons permits revoked. Some 2,300 adherents are considered to be prone to violence \u2013 an increase of 200 people compared to 2021. According to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, another cause for concern is that a significant number of the group\u2019s members are thought to be current or former soldiers, including from elite units, who are highly trained and in some cases legally possess firearms. Ginsburg calls the group \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d and is concerned that their ideology could spread. \u201cIf you look at the right-wing AfD [Alternative for Germany] party \u2013 a big party after all \u2013 you find bits and pieces of that conspiracy theory in their official programs and you have people sitting in the parliament in far-right circles, in Reichsb\u00fcrger circles,\u201d he said. To combat this threat, Ginsburg says the issue of the far right in Germany should be tackled in schools through better education on the subject. \u201cWe talk so much about the fight against the far right and about the long shadow of history, and yet the education on what fascist beliefs are, how widespread are they, how can we stop them, they are vague at best,\u201d he said. The German government insists it will continue to take action \u2013 like the raids seen this week \u2013 until the country is rid of such extremism. \u201cWe protect our democracy against extremist threats,\u201d the Interior Ministry said. \u201cWe will continue this tough approach until we have completely exposed and dismantled these structures. \u201cNo one in this extremist scene should feel safe.\u201d Nadine Schmidt reported from Berlin and Sophie Tanno reported from and wrote in London.", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/25/europe/germany-reichsbuerger-movement-explainer-intl", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230324121916-01-germany-reichsbuerger-movement.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "Sicilian island sees record-high migrant arrivals by boat", "author": "Valentina Di Donato", "date": "12:37 PM EDT, Sat March 25, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "A record of more than 2,000 migrants arrived on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa in the past day, an Italian official said on Saturday. Some 1,778 people arrived on Friday, with another 267 people landing on seven small boats overnight Saturday, the official said. Previous years have seen higher numbers of arrivals but never this early in the year in the space of a day. Lampedusa, not far from Sicily and the closest Italian island to Africa, is a major destination for migrants seeking to enter European Union countries. Charities rescued many of the boats. Under new rules from Italy\u2019s right-leaning government, NGOs face fines for breaking a code of conduct. The number of migrants arriving on Italy\u2019s shores by boats more than tripled in the first two months of 2023, compared to the same period last year, according to Italy\u2019s interior ministry. On Thursday Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni blamed the rising figure on the \u201cpolitical situation\u201d in Tunisia. \u201c900,000 people will arrive in Italy that Italy cannot welcome,\u201d Meloni told the European Council, while asking for collaboration with European partners to accept migrants and help block departures from Turkey, Libya and Tunisia. In February, a migrant shipwreck tragedy off the coast of Calabria in southern Italy killed more than 70 people. Earlier this month, Meloni wrote to European leaders, saying it was their \u201cduty, moral even before political\u201d to prevent another such tragedy, and that a distinction needs to be made between migration and refugees. \u201cConfusing the two levels, as has often been done so far, is to the detriment of the most fragile and those in need of help. And that\u2019s not right,\u201d she said, adding the need for a single policy on refugees across Europe.

Akufo-Addo made the disclosure Monday at a joint press conference with US Vice-President Kamala Harris, who\u2019s on a tour of the West African country. He pointed out that the proposed legislation , framed in the guise of \u201cfamily values\u201d \u2013 which seeks to introduce some of the harshest anti-LGBTQ laws on the African continent \u2013 was not legislation introduced by his government but a private members\u2019 bill. The bill was first introduced in parliament in August 2021. \u201cThe bill is going through the parliament. The attorney general has found it necessary to speak to the committee (the constitutional and legal committee of parliament) about it regarding the constitutionality \u2026 of several of its provisions. The parliament is dealing with it. At the end of the process, I will come in,\u201d the Ghanaian leader said . After parliamentary deliberations, a final bill will be sent to the president for assent. \u201cMy understanding \u2026 is that substantial elements of the bill have already been modified as a result of the intervention of the attorney general,\u201d  Akufo-Addo said. In suggesting that the bill may end up being watered down in the amendment process, Akufo-Addo added that he was convinced the parliament will consider the sensitivity of the bill to human rights issues as well as the feelings of the Ghanaian population \u201cand come out with a responsible response.\u201d However, one of the parliamentarians who introduced the bill, Samuel Nartey George, insists that the proposed law remains \u201crigid and tough.\u201d \u201cThe bill has not been substantially changed. The bill remains as tough and as rigid as it was,\u201d George told local media in a televised interview . He added: \u201cWhen the bill is laid before the House (of parliament), you will realize that the focus of the bill which has to do with voiding (gay) marriages, preventing them from adopting or fostering children, the clampdown on platforms and media houses that are going to do promotion and advocacy or push those materials still remain enforced.\u201d George also implied that restrictions against \u201cexpressions, be it lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender are all still there. \u201cSo when he (Akufo-Addo) says the bill has been watered down, he doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u201d The proposed aw would see LGBTQ Ghanaians face jail time, or be forced into so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d \u2013 a widely discredited practice debunked by much of the international medical and psychiatric communities. Under the bill, advocates of the LGBTQ community would face up to a decade in prison; public displays of same-sex affection or cross-dressing could lead to a fine or jail time, and certain types of medical support would be made illegal. The new law would also make the distribution of material deemed pro-LGBTQ by news organizations or websites illegal. It calls on Ghanaians to report those they suspect of being from the LGBTQ community. Harris, the US vice-president, said at the press conference she felt very strongly about supporting the freedom and equality of the LGBTQ community. \u201cThis is an issue that we consider to be a human rights issue, and that will not change,\u201d she said. Ghana\u2019s information minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, also told CNN on Tuesday that the outcome of the parliamentary debate on the bill may differ from its original provisions. \u201cThe bill is now in an enactment process. What will come out in enactment when 275 members get on the floor and start dealing with it clause by clause and voting clause by clause, may end up being different from what was proposed. You propose a bill and parliament \u2026 can tweak it and make it harsher or less harsh \u2026 it is in the hands of parliament now,\u201d Nkrumah said. The minister also insisted however that the Ghanaian government was not under pressure to relax existing legislation on homosexuality. \u201cWe are not pressured in any way to focus on things that are not essentially within our main priorities. Our priority number one is getting the Ghanaian economy on track and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\u201d \u201cThis conversation is not part of our mainstream conversation here in Ghana,\u201d he added. Old sodomy laws dating back to 1960 remain on the statute books in Ghana but they are rarely enforced. Activist Danny Bediako, who runs the NGO Rightify Ghana, told CNN that living in Ghana would become tougher for the LGBTQ community if the bill passes in parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make it difficult for the (LGBTQ) community to exist. They are just trying to erase the community through this bill, so it will definitely lead to an increase in attacks,\u201d said Bediako, who added that his organization had documented 27 cases of violent attacks targeted toward the LGBTQ community in the country this year. \u201cThere have been different types of cases, but the most dominant one is the activities of violent groups and they are widespread. So if this bill is passed, these activities are going to continue and it\u2019s only going to also get worse.\u201d", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/africa/ghana-softens-lgbtq-stance-intl", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230328143031-01-kamala-harris-nana-akufo-addo-press-conference.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "This lizard species stress-eats to cope with noisy US Army aircraft", "author": "Mindy Weisberger", "date": "8:19 AM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": " Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  Living in a neighborhood with lots of noise can make you jittery, especially if you\u2019re a lizard that\u2019s just a few inches long. It\u2019s no wonder that lizards exposed to noise pollution from low-flying fighter jets have resorted to stress-eating. Colorado checkered whiptails (Aspidoscelis neotesselatus) \u2014 striped and patterned lizards that live only in southeastern Colorado \u2014 are an all-female species that reproduce asexually. They also endure considerable noise from US Army flyovers. When researchers recently examined blood samples from these lizards, they detected elevated stress levels from the din. The lizards also had a coping strategy: They moved less, and they ate more. By snacking during noisy flyovers, the lizards are likely replenishing energy that\u2019s lost during metabolic responses to stress, scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Amphibian and Reptile Science.  \u201cWe show that noise disturbance does have measurable physiological impacts on Colorado checkered whiptails,\u201d co-lead study author Megen Kepas, a doctoral student at Utah State University, said in a statement. \u201c We also show that they are somewhat resilient and may compensate for this to some degree,\u201d by changing how much they eat and move when aircraft are nearby. \u201cI found the study to be super interesting,\u201d Tracy Langkilde, a professor of biology and the Verne M. Willaman Dean at Pennsylvania State University\u2019s Eberly College of Science, told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s been growing interest in the effects of noise on native animals,\u201d but research in this area focuses primarily on birds, said Langkilde, who was not involved in the study. Langkilde\u2019s research investigates stress responses in wood frogs that experience high levels of traffic noise near the roadside ponds where they breed. \u201cSeeing something about lizards is expanding our understanding on how noise affects our native species in really important ways,\u201d she said. In skies over grassland habitats that the checkered whiptails call home, military aircraft are a frequent presence. The lizard\u2019s range extends into the US Army\u2019s Fort Carson Military Base in Colorado Springs, which covers 212 square miles (550 square km) and contains several populations of the lizard.  Fort Carson was the main funder of the research. Fighter jets and transport aircraft soar overhead, along with Black Hawk, Apache and Chinook helicopters, often within 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) above the ground, according to the study. At times when there were no flyovers, ground readings registered no higher than 56 decibels (dB), about as loud as a refrigerator\u2019s hum. By comparison, ground readings during flyovers surged to 112 dB \u2014 louder than a jackhammer and just above the average pain threshold for humans.  During checkered whiptails\u2019 reproductive season in 2021, the scientists observed dozens of lizards during flyovers. They caught, weighed and measured the lizards, collecting blood samples from 82 females. The researchers also checked to see if lizards were carrying eggs, using a portable ultrasound device to determine egg size and number before marking and releasing the animals. Analysis of the blood samples showed elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increased production of ketones, which are energy-burning compounds associated with heightened stress. Flyovers also boosted the lizards\u2019 interest in food, with lizards hunkering down and spending more time eating than they did when aircraft were absent. Other studies have shown animals \u201cfreezing\u201d in response to disruptive noise, as the lizards did. But the lizards\u2019 feeding behavior \u201cis quite novel,\u201d as most prior research found that noise pollution typically led to animals eating less, the scientists wrote in the study. \u201cCompensatory eating would allow individuals to maintain their energy levels during a stressful event,\u201d said co-first author Layne Sermersheim, a master\u2019s candidate at Utah State University, in a statement. \u201cThis is important because metabolism, physical activity, investment into reproduction, and hormonal responses require energy.\u201d In humans, persistent stress can also raise cortisol levels, which can lead to i ncreased appetite and stress-eating . Such behaviors sometimes persist even after the original stress triggers subside. As for the lizards, stress from the flyovers could be reduced if pilots avoided locations where lizards gather during breeding season, the authors suggested. Another remedy could be flying high enough to lower noise at ground level to below 50 dB. A growing body of evidence shows that human noise pollution disrupts wildlife on land and in the oceans; it can affect the volume and frequency of animal vocalizations and may change their reproductive behavior, or where they choose to hunt. \u201cAlthough, the stress-eating \u2014 this is the first time that I know of that anyone has found this effect in response to anthropogenic stresses in the field,\u201d Langkilde said. While eating more makes sense for quickly replenishing stress-related energy loss, it remains to be seen how this behavior could affect lizard populations over the long term, she added. \u201cUnderstanding the implications of these adaptations is really important if we\u2019re truly to understand the consequences,\u201d Langkilde said.", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/americas/lizards-stress-eat-scn", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-full-169.jpg?q=w_1600,h_900,x_0,y_0,c_crop/h_720,w_1280/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "Blaze kills at least 38 people at migrant detention center near Mexico-US border", "author": "Gerardo Lemos", "date": "8:49 AM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "At least 38 people died on Monday night when a fire broke out at a government-run migrant detention center in Ciudad Juarez, a city in northern Mexico, on the United States border, Mexican officials said Tuesday. Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute (INM) revised the death toll down to 38 from after they announced the death toll as at least 40 deaths earlier Tuesday. The deadly blaze has underlined the urgent situation in Mexican cities along the border, which have been inundated with migrants sent back from the US by a pandemic-era public health restriction that is set to expire in early May. The fire at the INM facility started shortly after 10 p.m. inside an accommodation area, according to the agency. Authorities said it broke out after they picked up and detained a group of migrants from the streets of the border city, which sits across from El Paso, Texas. Sixty-eight men from Central and South America were being held at the facility, the INM said in a statement. At least 28 Guatemalan nationals were among the dead, Guatemala\u2019s Institute of Migration confirmed. One man was Colombian, one was Ecuadorian, 12 were Salvadorans, 13 were Honduran and 13 were Venezuelan, the INM said. It is unclear how many people of each nationality were killed or injured. At least 11 migrants remain in hospital following the fire, according to the government of Mexico\u2019s Chihuahua state. Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said that the men detained at the center were angry at the officials, and had been demonstrating against their deportation. \u201cWhat we know so far is that migrants from Central America and some from Venezuela were in that shelter. We still do not know exactly the names and nationalities of those who unfortunately lost their lives,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cThis had to do with a protest that they started after, we assume, they found out that they were going to be deported, and as a protest, they put mattresses from the shelter at the door of the shelter, and they set fire to them and they did not imagine that this was going to cause this terrible accident.\u201d \u201cIt is very sad that this is happening,\u201d the president added. Video recorded at the scene of the tragedy showed first responders aiding survivors, wrapping them in silver, thermal blankets, before placing them on stretchers and into ambulances. Firefighters carried limp, lifeless bodies from the building. Some of the victims\u2019 bodies were covered in black soot, placed next to each other in a row. A separate surveillance video from inside the center obtained by CNN shows how quickly the flames spread throughout the holding area after inmates set mattresses on fire. it also appears to show that those detained were behind bars with the gate locked. Andrea Chavez, Ciudad Juarez\u2019s federal deputy, shared her condolences with families of the migrants, and said that Mexican authorities had launched an investigation to determine who was responsible for the tragedy. \u201cIt is with deep sadness and grief that we learned of the fire that occurred inside the INM in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez,\u201d she said on Twitter. An eyewitness to the blaze, a Venezuelan woman whose husband was trapped inside the building and injured in the fire, spoke to Reuters news agency. Fighting back tears, she blamed Mexican authorities and claimed the doors to the detention center were not opened. \u201cAt 10 p.m., we started to see smoke billowing from everywhere, everybody ran away but they left the men locked in. Everybody was removed from the area, but they left the men locked in. They never opened the door,\u201d 31-year-old Viangly Infante, a Venezuelan national, told the agency. Her husband, 27-year-old Eduard Caraballo, was inside the detention center and survived by spraying water on himself, according to Infante, who said she saw many dead bodies. He was taken to the hospital with breathing problems, Reuters reported. Another Venezuelan migrant, Emilio Jose, who was looking for his wife, told Reuters that he was not being given any information regarding her whereabouts. \u201cEven if we are illegal or undocumented, we are human beings who feel. Look at what happened; some people are injured and are suffering the consequences of what happened,\u201d he said. The INM said it strongly rejected \u201cthe acts that led to this tragedy,\u201d adding that an investigation was underway. They did not indicate the cause of the fire. CNN has reached out to Mexico\u2019s migration authorities for comment on the blaze. Later on Tuesday, the agency said that migrants injured in the fire would be granted \u201cvisitor cards,\u201d which will allow them to obtain legal immigration status in Mexico valid for one year. \u201cThe immigration authority will provide visitor cards for humanitarian reasons to the injured and will cover the medical requirements for a speedy recovery,\u201d INM commissioner Francisco Gardu\u00f1o said during a visit to local hospitals where migrants were being treated. Migrants who are unaccompanied minors, have witnessed a crime or been victim to a crime while in Mexico are eligible for a visitor card, according to the Mexican immigration agency. The blaze is one of the worst in recent years in Mexico, which has seen record levels of crossings on its northern border, as people try to make it into the US. Migrant numbers at the US-Mexico border have been on the rise since last year, with increasing numbers of people from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Colombia \u2013 many fleeing repressive government and stark economic pressures. On March 12, hundreds of people tried to cross the border , gathering at a bridge connecting Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez with El Paso, Texas. The attempt at a mass entry caused disruptions along the border and authorities erected barricades to block the flow. Migrants often wait for weeks or months in Mexico to present their case at a port of entry. In the meantime, many sleep rough in the streets, begging for change to survive. Earlier this year, the Biden administration ramped up efforts to curb crossings. In February, it released a new rule that largely prohibits migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the shared frontier from applying for asylum in the US, marking a significant departure from decadeslong protocol. The proposed regulation is likely to take effect in May, when a Trump-era pandemic border restriction, known as Title 42, is set to expire in May. The Biden administration has leaned on Title 42, which has allowed border officials to turn away migrants who might otherwise qualify for asylum to be expelled, turned back to Mexico or sent directly to their home countries. But with the clock ticking on its potential expiration and amid ongoing litigation, officials are considering other enforcement measures as tens of thousands of migrants continue to move in the Western Hemisphere. The proposal has been panned by human rights advocates and immigration experts, who say, among other things, it may increase Mexico\u2019s attractiveness as a pit stop for those ultimately aiming to request asylum in the US. On Tuesday, the International Rescue Committee said that the fire was proof of the pressing need to ensure systems are in place to provide safety for people in need of international protection. \u201cAs Mexico receives historic numbers of new asylum claims and the U.S. continues to implement policies that push asylum seekers back into Mexico, humanitarian infrastructure in the country is increasingly strained and more people are stuck in highly vulnerable situations,\u201d Rafael Vel\u00e1squez, country director for the IRC in Mexico, said. \u201cThese risks are particularly tangible in cities along the U.S.-Mexico border, such as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which for years have seen increasing numbers of displaced people as new and stricter border policies have been put in place.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sahar Akbarzai, Bertha Ramos, Marlon Sorto and Hira Humayun contributed to this report.

This woman says she knows why", "author": "Nectar Gan", "date": "10:20 AM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "For 12 years, Program Think, an anonymous Chinese blogger, mounted an open challenge to China\u2019s tightening authoritarian grip and expanding surveillance state. The freewheeling blog offered a mixture of technical cybersecurity advice and scathing political commentary \u2013 including tips on how to safely circumvent China\u2019s Great Firewall of internet censorship, develop critical thinking and resist the increasingly totalitarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The blogger took pride in their ability to cover their digital tracks and avoid getting caught \u2013 even as a growing number of government critics were ensnared in Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s strident crackdown on dissent. Then, in May 2021, Program Think suddenly went silent. The blog stopped updating and its Twitter and GitHub accounts turned dormant. Its author had promised followers to never stay inactive for more than 14 days. Many feared the blogger had been struck by an accident or illness, or tracked down and detained by authorities. Speculation abounded, yet no one was able to offer concrete evidence. Program Think had so closely guarded their identity that no supporters knew who the blogger was \u2013 except that they had been a programmer inside mainland China with a decade-long career in information security. Now, almost two years later, the wife of a blogger recently sentenced to seven years in a Chinese prison for \u201cinciting subversion of state power\u201d believes she has the answer to the question: What happened to Program Think? The woman, surnamed Bei, is the wife of Ruan Xiaohuan, a 45-year-old man who was taken away by police from his Shanghai home on May 10, 2021 \u2013 one day after Program Think\u2019s final blog post. Ruan\u2019s detention caught Bei completely dumbfounded. And she would be even more shocked to learn her husband was blogging about politically sensitive subjects. \u201cThe police told me his case was very serious, and I thought, how is it possible?\u201d Bei told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s a tech nerd and he loved delving into technology. How could he have so much energy to write articles on current political affairs?\u201d Throughout the investigation and court procedures, Bei was unable to learn much detail about her husband\u2019s case as authorities told her it involved \u201cstate secrets.\u201d Ruan was tried in secret, and Bei only saw him again at his sentencing at the Shanghai No. 2 Intermediate Court on February 10 this year, she said. \u201cHe was abnormally thin, and his hair has turned almost all white,\u201d Bei said. Ruan didn\u2019t say a word and half of his face was covered by a Covid face mask. \u201cAfter the sentencing, he turned around to look at me as if expressing dissent and seeking help. I could tell the sentence was much heavier than he had expected,\u201d she said. \u201cI told him: \u2018Appeal.\u2019\u201d According to a copy of the verdict seen by CNN, the court ruled that Ruan had \u201clong harbored dissatisfaction\u201d with China\u2019s political system and social governance. \u201cSince June 2009, (Ruan) has used his computer to write more than a hundred seditious articles that spread rumors and slander, attack and smear the country\u2019s current political system, incite subversion of state power, and intent to overthrow the socialist system,\u201d the court verdict said. It added that the articles, published on overseas platforms, attracted \u201ca large number of internet users to read, comment and share, causing pernicious consequences.\u201d But the court documents did not mention the name of Ruan\u2019s blog, or provide details on the content it deemed subversive. After the sentencing, the judge asked Bei to sign an agreement not to publicize the verdict, which she refused, Bei told CNN. Determined to find out what authorities had withheld from her, Bei learned how to use a VPN, or virtual private network, to bypass China\u2019s strict internet restrictions. She searched for media reports about Chinese bloggers who went missing, until she came across a blog with a picture of Rodin\u2019s sculpture \u201cThe Thinker\u201d as its avatar. Its name: Program Think. It was, by Bei\u2019s own admission, a light bulb moment. All the information about the blog matched up with that of her husband. The blog started in 2009 and its last post, a long list of book recommendations, was published on May 9 \u2013 a day before Ruan was taken away and had his laptop confiscated. There was also a four-month period, Bei remembered, when Ruan was sick and bedridden that coincided with a lull in publishing. The author\u2019s writing style and aspirations seemed all too familiar, so did his bluntness and confidence that sometimes bordered on arrogance, Bei said. She learned during police investigations that her husband had posted more than 700 articles on an overseas platform \u2013 just as Program Think did. \u201cIt can\u2019t be just a coincidence,\u201d Bei said. She burst into tears at an internet cafe the moment she drew what she believes to be the connection between her husband and the influential blogger, she recalled. \u201cI came to realize how much pressure he had been under for such a long time. He was doing all these dangerous things, carrying so much weight on his shoulders all by himself,\u201d she said. \u201cEven after he was caught, no one could help him because nobody knew he was Program Think.\u201d CNN has been unable to confirm Ruan\u2019s online identity and messages to the email address listed on the dormant Program Think blog have gone unanswered. CNN made multiple phone calls to the Shanghai No. 2 Intermediate Court, but couldn\u2019t reach anyone who was willing to comment on Ruan\u2019s case or answer whether his conviction is linked to the Program Think blog. Bei, however, is confident the two are connected and said she regrets not knowing earlier about what she believes was her husband\u2019s online identity. Had she known, she said, she would have immediately sought help from human rights lawyers who have the expertise and experience in representing defendants in sensitive political cases. Last month, Bei appointed two of China\u2019s most prominent human rights lawyers, Mo Shaoping and Shang Baojun, as Ruan\u2019s defense attorneys for his appeal. But the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court turned them away, claiming Ruan had asked for legal assistance and the state had already appointed him two lawyers. CNN has reached out to the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court for comment. In politically sensitive cases, the state often denies family-appointed attorneys and assigns its own lawyers instead. Despite official pressure on her to stay quiet, she decided to go public with Ruan\u2019s case, hoping the media exposure and public attention might help her husband receive a fair appeal. \u201cI\u2019ve wasted the opportunity (to help him) for his first trial. I can\u2019t miss the appeal too, it\u2019s the last chance \u2013 I have to make sure it\u2019ll be fair,\u201d she said. Born in the province of Fujian on China\u2019s southeastern coast, Ruan first came into contact with a computer at junior high school. He was interested in software viruses and taught himself programming, he said in an interview with a state-affiliated academic journal. He went on to study at the prestigious East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai, where he met Bei, his future wife. They both majored in chemical engineering, but by then Ruan had become infatuated with computer science. He spent all his free time reading about it at the library. He and his roomates also bought a computer so they could take turns to use it in their dormitory, Bei said. Ruan was so eager to join the industry that he gave up on completing his university degree. \u201cHe told me computer science is developing too fast and academic qualifications can\u2019t represent one\u2019s ability,\u201d Bei recalled. The move paid off and Ruan\u2019s career took off immediately. He went on to work in some of China\u2019s most renowned cybersecurity companies. He served as the chief engineer for the information security system of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, when he was working for the network security firm Venustech. Ruan later joined another company and was promoted to chief technology officer. In his interview with the state-affiliated journal at the time, Ruan said: \u201cI am someone who is fascinated by technology, only new technology makes me full of passion.\u201d But he grew increasingly frustrated by the restraints on research and development in companies due to their unrelenting pursuit of profits. In 2012, Ruan quit his job to focus on developing open source software. Up until his arrest, Bei recalled, Ruan would spend his hours working from his north-facing study, typing away at his keyboard or reading. Ruan never cared much about money or material comfort. Instead, he longed for what he called the \u201copen source spirit\u201d \u2013 freedom, openness, sharing and cooperation, Bei said. \u201cHe thinks one must pursue spiritual values in life. For him, it is technology \u2013 that\u2019s what he finds valuable. But only recently did I discover that his (quest) for freedom had also morphed into a (longing for) political freedom,\u201d she said. Ruan was working in his study when the police came knocking on the apartment door on May 10, 2021, Bei said. She thought it was a bottled water delivery and asked her husband to answer it. Ruan was taken away by force, shattering a lens of his eyeglasses. More than half a dozen police officers stormed in to search their apartment. The search lasted from noon to the early hours of the next day, Bei said. Ruan\u2019s laptop was still running at the time, and police kept the device on when transferring it to the police station in order to seize all of its data, according to the court verdict. The court documents said police also seized an iPhone, a Xiaomi phone and Huawei laptop, but Bei said those were her devices. Now, thinking back, Bei said she might have overlooked some early warning signs. About a year before Ruan\u2019s arrest, the internet service at their home became unstable and disconnected frequently, she said. When they went out for a stroll, Ruan would sometimes suddenly hurry back home, as if to check whether they had any intruders. Now, looking back, Bei said if she had known, she wouldn\u2019t have supported her husband\u2019s decision to blog about politics. \u201cI think he would have made a greater contribution to human society if he spent his time on technology,\u201d she said. Program Think didn\u2019t start blogging to voice political dissent, either. In its first post , published in January 2009, the author introduced the blog as a place to share skills and experience on software development and programming language. But it did not take long for the contents to intersect with politics. On June 4, 2009, the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, the blogger shared how-tos on circumventing internet restrictions and how to conceal your identity online. A week later, in another post , the author decried China\u2019s tightening internet censorship. A series of international social media platforms, including Twitter and Flickr, were added to the banned list, while Chinese authorities issued a directive demanding the mandatory installation of censorship software on all new computers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep silent anymore, I don\u2019t want to avoid these issues anymore, it\u2019s time to write something other than technology!\u201d the post concluded. Soon after, Program Think  started posting more overt political commentaries. \u201cIn China, you don\u2019t have to care about politics, but politics will come and pay attention to you,\u201d Program Think wrote in a blog post on June 4 in 2011, explaining the decision to start a series on the Tiananmen crackdown. In 2016, following the release of the Panama Papers, Program Think compiled publicly available data allegedly detailing connections between Communist Party leaders and their relatives. The data, which Program Think said was aimed at \u201cexposing the powerful families\u201d of China\u2019s ruling elite, prompted the Cyber Security Association of China to send GitHub a takedown request . Github did not comply, and the database is still accessible on the platform. As Program Think\u2019s profile grew, so did the scrutiny from Chinese authorities. In 2019, in a post titled \u201cWhy the Authorities Can\u2019t Catch Me \u2013 A Summary of My Security Experience After Ten Years of Anti-Party Activities,\u201d Program Think said state hackers had twice tried to attack his Gmail account; and the comment section of the blog had been flooded by what the blogger suspected to be government-employed commentators. But Program Think remained undeterred and carried on blogging, until they seemingly vanished without a trace. Chinese authorities have never made any public mention of Program Think. But many Chinese rights activists, China experts and followers of the blog believe Ruan is indeed the missing blogger. Several international rights groups, including PEN America and Human Rights Watch , have also linked Ruan to Program Think and called for his immediate release. Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen movement, said the official secrecy surrounding Program Think betrayed the authorities\u2019 fear of the blogger\u2019s influence. \u201cUnder the Communist Party\u2019s ubiquitous surveillance \u2013 both online and in real life, he managed to carry on for 12 years \u2013 that is a marvelous legend in itself,\u201d said Zhou, Executive Director of Human Rights in China. Program Think could have easily enjoyed a comfortable life, and yet, he chose to use his expertise to spread the idea of freedom, Zhou said. \u201cHe has influenced many people \u2013 in the hundreds of thousands,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one man against the state machine.\u201d To Program Think\u2019s supporters, the blog\u2019s very existence served as an open challenge to the authority of the party, both in terms of ideology and technology. Some compared the blogger to \u201cV,\u201d the masked freedom fighter in the Alan Moore graphic novel \u201cV for Vendetta.\u201d Others called Program Think China\u2019s \u201ccyber Prometheus,\u201d the ancient Greek god who stole fire from heaven and gave it to humanity. Eric Liu, an analyst at China Digital Times, a US-based news website tracking censorship in China, said he had followed \u201cProgram Think\u201d from early on. In the beginning, the blog did not stand out as particularly sensitive because critical voices abounded on the Chinese internet at the time, according to Liu. \u201cIt is the rapid shrinking of China\u2019s political space over the past decade that pushed him to the forefront of so-called anti-Communist Party activities,\u201d he said. Searches for \u201cProgram Think\u201d are heavily restricted on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo. In an oblique reference to the blogger, a Weibo user posted on Friday: \u201c(One) can only program, but not think.\u201d That post has since been deleted from search results. Following Ruan\u2019s sentencing, his name has also been banned on on Chinese social media platforms. \u201cThe authorities don\u2019t want people talking about him, and the last thing they want is a solidarity campaign (to call for his release),\u201d Liu said. While there may never be official confirmation on whether Ruan and Program Think are the same person, many followers are convinced they are. And regardless of his detention by authorities, they say the knowledge and ideas shared in the blog have already spread far and wide. \u201cYou are already a well-deserved hero in the hearts of countless people, and we will live with the torch you ignited,\u201d a follower said on the Program Think Twitter  page.", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/china/china-blogger-sentenced-program-think-intl-mic-hnk", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230328202721-programthink-avatar.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "Crucial Antarctic ocean circulation heading for collapse if planet-warming pollution remains high, scientists warn", "author": "Hilary Whiteman", "date": "11:04 AM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "Melting ice in the Antarctic is not just raising sea levels but slowing down the circulation of deep ocean water with vast implications for the global climate and for marine life, a new study warns. Led by scientists from the University of New South Wales and published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the peer-reviewed study modeled the impact of melting Antarctic ice on deep ocean currents that work to flush nutrients from the sea floor to fish near the surface. Three years of computer modeling found the Antarctic overturning circulation \u2013 also known as abyssal ocean overturning \u2013 is on track to slow 42% by 2050 if the world continues to burn fossil fuels and produce high levels of planet-heating pollution. A slow down is expected to speed up ice melt and potentially end an ocean system that has helped sustain life for thousands of years. \u201cThe projections we have make it look like the Antarctic overturning would collapse this century,\u201d said Matthew England, deputy director of the Australian Research Council\u2019s Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science, who coordinated the study. \u201cIn the past, these overturning circulations changed over the course of 1,000 years or so, and we\u2019re talking about changes within a few decades. So it is pretty dramatic,\u201d he said. Most previous studies have focused on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the system of currents that carry warm water from the tropics into the North Atlantic. The cold, saltier water then sinks and flows south. Its Southern Ocean equivalent is less studied but does an important job moving nutrient-dense water north from Antarctica, past New Zealand and into the North Pacific Ocean, the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean, the report\u2019s authors said in a briefing. The circulation of deep ocean water is considered vital for the health of the sea \u2013 and plays an important role in sequestering carbon absorbed from the atmosphere.  According to the report, while a slowdown of the AMOC would mean the deep Atlantic Ocean would get colder, the slower circulation of dense water in the Antarctic means the deepest waters of the Southern Ocean will warm up.   \u201cOne of the concerning things of this slowdown is that there can be feedback to further ocean warming at the base of the ice shelves around Antarctica. And that would lead to more ice melt, reinforcing or amplifying the original change,\u201d England said. As global temperatures rise, Antarctic ice is expected to melt faster, but that doesn\u2019t mean the circulation of deep water will increase \u2013 in fact the opposite, scientists said. In a healthy system, the cold and salty \u2013 or dense \u2013 consistency of melted Antarctic ice allows it to sink to the deepest layer of the ocean. From there it sweeps north, carrying carbon and higher levels of oxygen than might otherwise be present in water around 4,000 meters deep. As the current moves northward, it agitates deep layers of debris on the ocean floor \u2013 remains of decomposing sea life thick with nutrients \u2013 that feed the bottom of the food chain, scientists said. In certain areas, mostly south of Australia in the Southern Ocean and in the tropics, this nutrient-rich cold water moves toward the surface in a process called upwelling, distributing the nutrients to higher layers of the ocean, England said. However, Wednesday\u2019s study found that as global temperatures warm, melting sea ice \u201cfreshens\u201d the water around Antarctica, diluting its saltiness and raising its temperature, meaning it\u2019s less dense and doesn\u2019t sink to the bottom as efficiently as it once did. The report\u2019s co-author, Steve Rintoul from Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership, said sea life in waters worldwide rely on nutrients brought back up to the surface, and that the Antarctic overturning is a key component of that upwelling of nutrients. \u201cWe know that nutrients exported from the Southern Ocean in other current systems support about three quarters of global phytoplankton production \u2013 the base of the food chain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that the sinking of dense water near Antarctica will decline by 40% by 2050. And it\u2019ll be sometime between 2050 and 2100 that we start to see the impacts of that on surface productivity.\u201d England added: \u201cPeople born today are going to be around then. So, it\u2019s certainly stuff that will challenge societies in the future.\u201d The report\u2019s authors say the slowing of the Antarctic ocean overturning has other knock-on effects for the planet \u2013 for example, it could shift rain bands in the tropics by as much as 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). \u201cShut it down completely and you get this reduction of rainfall in one band south of the equator and an increase in the band to the north. So we could see impacts on rainfall in the tropics,\u201d said England. Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in its latest report that the impacts of rising global temperatures were more severe than expected. Without immediate and deep changes, the world is hurtling toward increasingly dangerous and irreversible consequences of climate change, it added. The IPCC report found that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels was still possible, but it\u2019s becoming harder to achieve the longer the world fails to cut carbon pollution. England points out that the IPCC predictions don\u2019t include ice melt from Antarctic ice sheets and shelves. \u201cThat\u2019s a very significant component of change that\u2019s already underway around Antarctica with more to come in the next few decades,\u201d England said. Rintoul said the study was another urgent warning on top of all the ones that have come before it. \u201cEven though the direct effect on fisheries through reduced nutrient supply might take decades to play out, we will commit ourselves to that future with the choices we make over the next decade.\u201d", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/antarctic-overturning-collapse-2050-climate-scn-intl-hnk", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329045214-01-antarctica-ice-020722-file-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "Netanyahu is backed into a corner.

Sign up here . When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his decision to delay a controversial plan to weaken the country\u2019s judiciary on Monday, he invoked the biblical story of the Judgement of Solomon, where the king had to rule between two women, both claiming to be the mother of a child. Solomon ordered that the child be cut in two, and the woman who protested the ruling was determined to be the real mother. Before Netanyahu spoke, supporters of the judicial overhaul had gathered in the streets following calls from right-wing politicians to come out, allowing the prime minister to make his address as protesters from both sides rallied simultaneously for the first time in weeks. \u201cEven today, both sides in the national dispute claim love for the baby \u2013 love for our country,\u201d said Netanyahu. \u201cI am aware of the enormous tension that is building up between the two camps, between the two parts of the people, and I am attentive to the desire of many citizens to relieve this tension.\u201d The timing of the address was likely intentional and was meant to give Netanyahu\u2019s much-delayed speech a favorable backdrop \u2013 two competing camps demonstrating their love for the country, said Aviv Bushinsky, a former media adviser for Netanyahu who served the prime minister for nine years. Netanyahu\u2019s strategy has always been based on last-minute decisions, Bushinsky said, which sometimes makes it difficult to predict his next move. Other analysts say the prime minister\u2019s strategy brings uncertainty to Israel\u2019s future. \u201cHe is playing the game,\u201d said Gideon Rahat, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cYou can never know what will happen, and that\u2019s the problem \u2026 There is no certainty in Israel, in the Israeli system, and I am not sure that he\u2019s not happy about this.\u201d Bushinsky says that if it was up to Netanyahu he would have pumped the brakes on the judicial overhaul a long time ago, as it wasn\u2019t one of the main leadership goals declared at the start of his sixth term as prime minister. He\u2019s standing by it because the survival of his coalition depends on it. But now, analysts say he\u2019s backed into a corner between appeasing protesters and keeping his government intact. Before Netanyahu announced the delay, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir\u2019s Jewish Power party broke the news, noting that part of the delay agreement was to establish a National Guard. That caused alarm, with some speculating on social media that Ben Gvir, who has an extremist past, was being allowed to set up his own militia. Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson on Tuesday that putting Ben Gvir in charge of the National Guard is \u201cthe equivalent of putting the fox in charge of the henhouse .\u201d Ben Gvir was quick to address the concerns about the new body. \u201cLet\u2019s put things straight: no private army and no militias,\u201d he said in a statement published on his Telegram page . Bushinsky downplayed the significance of the National Guard, saying it is \u201ca comfort prize\u201d for Ben Gvir \u2013 \u201ca prize for the losers.\u201d The prime minister is now faced with very few options, analysts say. If he sides with his coalition and votes on the overhaul, crippling protests and strikes would resume. If he pulls the brakes, his coalition could collapse. The only wiggle room the Israeli leader has, analysts say, is if negotiators reach a moderated judicial overhaul plan bill over the Knesset\u2019s recess period, which ends April 30, and where concessions to his right-wing coalition members need not be too extreme. Netanyahu may also be hoping for the reform bill to be shelved for the time being. \u201cI think Netanyahu will try to run away from this thing, hoping that things will gradually ease,\u201d said Bushinsky, noting that the ministers who had threatened to resign should the bill not advance have all remained in their posts. Analysts say, however, that what could once again unite the fragmented country and have the public rally behind the government is a potential security threat , either from neighboring countries or through conflict with the Palestinians. A security crisis would reorient the government\u2019s attention, said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, whether it arises from conflict with the Palestinians , the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon or others. \u201cSome thought that if there was a security crisis, then Netanyahu would be saved by the bell,\u201d said Bushinsky. Palestinians are watching the process with unease amid fears that they will pay the price of Netanyahu\u2019s concessions to right-wing coalition members with a history of anti-Palestinian rhetoric. \u201cWe are seeing that Palestinians are once again paying the price for Israel\u2019s electoral choices,\u201d said Buttu. \u201cThere may be calm in the streets of Tel Aviv \u2026 but for Palestinians, the reality remains the same.\u201d How Netanyahu will act remains uncertain, and not everyone is optimistic that the recess period will yield any kind of consensus or moderation in his position. \u201cI have not detected any indication that tells me that the prime minister is actually entering into the negotiations with a keen interest in achieving consensus \u2026 including comprises on core aspects of the judicial overhaul,\u201d said Plesner. Plesner notes, however, that Netanyahu and his Likud party emerged \u201cpolitically injured\u201d from the last few months, losing not only legitimacy and support in the eyes of the Israeli people, but also in the eyes of his own Likud voters. \u201c(It was) a dramatic erosion of their political power and political posture,\u201d he said.  Biden, Netanyahu trade barbs over plan to weaken courts; Israel rejects US \u2018pressure\u2019  Israel\u2019s embattled prime minister escalated a rare public dispute with US President Joe Biden on Tuesday, rejecting \u201cpressure\u201d from the White House after Biden criticized Netanyahu\u2019s  efforts to weaken Israel\u2019s judiciary. Biden said on Tuesday that he won\u2019t invite Netanyahu to the White House \u201cin the near term,\u201d and issued an unusually stinging rebuke of the Israeli leader\u2019s  proposed judicial overhaul. Netanyahu responded late on Tuesday, saying, \u201cIsrael is a sovereign country which makes its decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends.\u201d  Riyadh joins Shanghai Cooperation Organization as ties with Beijing grow  Saudi Arabia\u2019s cabinet approved on Wednesday a decision to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), as Riyadh builds a long-term partnership with China despite US security concerns, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabia has approved a memorandum on granting the kingdom the status of a dialog partner in the SCO, state news agency SPA said.  US sanctions Syrian leader Assad\u2019s cousins, others over drug trade  The US on Tuesday imposed new sanctions against six people, including two cousins of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, for their role in the production or export of captagon, a dangerous amphetamine, Reuters cited the Treasury Department as saying. The Treasury said trade in captagon was estimated to be a billion-dollar enterprise and the sanctions highlight the role of Lebanese drug traffickers and the Assad family dominance of captagon trafficking, which helped fund the Syrian government.

A Ramadan TV show is in hot water for its offensive depiction of Iraqi women, drawing condemnation from politicians in both Kuwait and Iraq. The series, \u201c London Class ,\u201d is produced by the Saudi state-backed media conglomerate MBC group and depicts Iraqi women working as maids for Kuwaiti women and being accused of theft. The show follows a group of Arab medicine students at a London university in the 1980s. Much of the anger from Iraqis is directed at Kuwait. The Kuwaiti Ministry of Information has however said the show has nothing to do with the country and was not shown on any platform there, according to Arabic media. One Baghdad-based Twitter user condemned what he said was a repeated \u201cstream of hatred and malice from Kuwaiti shows towards our people.\u201d The show was written by Kuwaiti writer Heba Hamada and directed by Egyptian Mohamed Bakir. Hamada responded to the criticism in an Instagram post , saying: \u201cIraq is the mother of civilization, and all Arabs lean on its shoulder.\u201d Mustafa Jabbar Sanad, a member of parliament in Iraq, accused the show of \u201cerasing the value of well-known Iraqi talents \u2026 to distort the image of the Iraqi people as a whole, not just women.\u201d Hamada was the subject of criticism in 2019 because of a similar show she wrote called \u201cCairo Class,\u201d which caused strife between Kuwaitis and Egyptians due its portrayal of Egypt. That show is being aired on Netflix. The question of honor, particularly that of Iraqi women, has long been a sensitive issue in Kuwaiti-Iraqi relations. Former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had accused Kuwait of insulting his country\u2019s women, citing it as a reason for his invasion of the country  in 1990. In a 2004 court hearing in Iraq, the former president decried being held accountable for the invasion. \u201cHow could Saddam be tried over Kuwait that said it will reduce Iraqi women to 10-dinar prostitutes?\u201d he asked, referring to himself. \u201cHe (Hussein) defended Iraq\u2019s honor and revived its historical rights over those dogs,\u201d Saddam said, referring to the Kuwaitis. Iraq made its final reparation payment for that invasion last year, having paid the Gulf nation a total of $52.4 billion .

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  An ultramassive black hole , understood to be one of the largest ever detected, has been discovered by astronomers using a new technique. The findings, published by the Royal Astronomical Society, show that the black hole is more than 30 billion times the mass of the sun \u2013 a scale rarely seen by astronomers. The researchers described it as an \u201cextremely exciting\u201d discovery that opens up \u201ctantalizing\u201d possibilities for detecting further black holes . The team, led by Durham University in the United Kingdom, used a technique known as gravitational lensing \u2013 whereby a nearby galaxy is used as a giant magnifying glass to bend the light from a more distant object. This enabled them to closely examine how light is bent by a black hole inside a galaxy hundreds of millions of light years from Earth. Supercomputer simulations and images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope were also used to confirm the size of the black hole. This is the first black hole found using gravitational lensing, with the team simulating light traveling through the universe hundreds of thousands of times, according to a news release from the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cThis particular black hole, which is roughly 30 billion times the mass of our Sun, is one of the biggest ever detected and on the upper limit of how large we believe black holes can theoretically become, so it is an extremely exciting discovery,\u201d lead study author James Nightingale, an observational cosmologist from the Department of Physics at Durham University, said. \u201cMost of the biggest black holes that we know about are in an active state, where matter pulled in close to the black hole heats up and releases energy in the form of light, X-rays, and other radiation,\u201d Nightingale added. \u201cHowever, gravitational lensing makes it possible to study inactive black holes, something not currently possible in distant galaxies. This approach could let us detect many more black holes beyond our local universe and reveal how these exotic objects evolved further back in cosmic time.\u201d Researchers believe the finding is significant as it \u201copens up the tantalising possibility that astronomers can discover far more inactive and ultramassive black holes than previously thought\u201d and \u201cinvestigate how they grew so large,\u201d according to the news release. The story of this particular discovery started back in 2004 when fellow Durham University astronomer, Alastair Edge, a research fellow, noticed a giant arc of a gravitational lens when reviewing images of a galaxy survey, according to the news release. The team has now revisited the discovery and explored it further with the help of NASA\u2019s Hubble telescope and the DiRAC COSMA8 supercomputer. Ultramassive black holes are the most massive objects in the universe and a rare find for astronomers. Their origins are unclear, with some believing they were formed from the merging of galaxies billions of years ago. Each time a galaxy merges with another one, stars are lost and a black hole gains mass \u2013 which accounts for the incredibly high mass of some black holes.", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/europe/ultramassive-black-hole-intl-gbr-scn", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-full-169.jpg?q=w_1600,h_900,x_0,y_0,c_crop/h_720,w_1280/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "\u2018A win of epic proportions\u2019: World\u2019s highest court can set out countries\u2019 climate obligations after Vanuatu secures historic UN vote", "author": "Rachel Ramirez", "date": "11:27 AM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu on Wednesday won a historic vote at the United Nations that calls on the world\u2019s highest court to establish for the first time the obligations countries have to address the climate crisis \u2014 and the consequences if they don\u2019t. Vanuatu has long faced the disproportionate impacts of rising seas and intensifying storms. And in 2021, it launched its call for the UN International Court of Justice to provide an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d on the legal responsibility of governments to fight the climate crisis, arguing that climate change has become a human rights issue for Pacific Islanders. Although the advisory opinion will be non-binding, it will carry significant weight and authority and could inform climate negotiations as well as future climate lawsuits around the world. It could also strengthen the position of climate-vulnerable countries in international negotiations. This year has already been rough for Vanuatu: It is currently under a six-month state of emergency after a rare pair of Category 4 cyclones pummeled the country within 48 hours during the first week of March. The islands\u2019 residents are still picking their way through the storms\u2019 rubble. Wednesday\u2019s resolution for an advisory opinion passed by majority, backed by more than 130 countries. Two of the world\u2019s largest climate polluters , the US and China, did not express support, but did not object meaning the measure passed by consensus. This is the first time the highest international court is called on to address the climate crisis.  The landmark decision is \u201cessential,\u201d UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in his remarks to the assembly. \u201cClimate justice is both a moral imperative and a prerequisite for effective global climate action.\u201d Advisory opinions have \u201ctremendous importance and can have a long-standing impact on the international legal order,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cToday we have witnessed a win for climate justice of epic proportions,\u201d said Ishmael Kalsakau, prime minister of Vanuatu, soon after the resolution was adopted. \u201cThe very fact that a small Pacific island nation like Vanuatu was able to successfully spearhead such a transformative outcome speaks to the incredible support from all corners of the globe.\u201d Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s minister of climate change adaptation, told CNN that he hopes the opinion would be \u201cgreatly persuasive in terms of increasing domestic action and identifying what gaps in international law and domestic law need to be filled.\u201d \u201cIt is quite historic,\u201d he added. The push to seek an advisory opinion from the world\u2019s highest court began in an environmental law class in Fiji in 2019. Cynthia Houniuhi, president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change , said she and her peers had been looking for ways to address the climate crisis head-on through various international legal pathways, until they decided on the International Court of Justice. \u201cTo be honest, at first, I was very hesitant when this idea was discussed,\u201d Houniuhi said. \u201cMy mind keeps telling me to back off. I mean, let\u2019s be real here, it was too ambitious to say the least. Like, how can a small group of students from the Pacific Region convince the majority of the UN members to support this unique initiative?\u201d But as Pacific Island nations continue to suffer from hotter temperatures and more droughts , rising sea levels , and increasingly intense cyclones , Houniuhi realized they needed to do this. \u201cWhat is the use of learning all this knowledge if it\u2019s not for people to fight the single greatest threat to their security?\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, the memories of my childhood growing up in my village with my people are slowly fading, as the environment that sustained us disintegrates before our eyes.\u201d Tropical cyclones are not rare in Oceania, but Vanuatu, which has the highest disaster risk in the world, suffers disproportionately highly. Scientists say these storms are intensifying as the planet warms and will continue to carry a tremendous economic toll . According to Regenvanu, the financial damage caused by the recent twin cyclones will likely amount to more than half of Vanuatu\u2019s GDP. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to try to recover, rebuild, all the while knowing that we are coming up to the next climate impact.\u201d To get support for their idea, the Pacific Island students passed around a petition that garnered signatures from teachers and students. And while campaigning for the initiative, they drafted a letter and proposal that they sent to Pacific Island governments. After receiving positive feedback from Vanuatu, the student members met with Regenvanu, who was the foreign affairs minister at the time. \u201cI could empathize with them, and I share their convictions and passions,\u201d Regenvanu said. \u201cI was very happy to receive that proposal and to commit to advancing it.\u201d The Vanuatu government kept its word, endorsing the proposal and taking it to the international stage. \u201cIt was history in the making,\u201d Houniuhi said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to show a picture to my child one day of my island. I want my child to be able to experience the same environment in the same culture that I grew up in.\u201d During last year\u2019s UN Climate Week in New York City, a group of Pacific Islander climate activists amped up the pressure on UN leaders, who were gathering for the annual UN General Assembly to discuss climate change-related matters. Along the East River in front of the UN headquarters, students and climate activists sailed in a flotilla of boats, flying the flags of more than a dozen Pacific Island nations while calling on leaders to vote \u201cyes\u201d to their request for an advisory opinion. The momentum continued two months later at the UN\u2019s COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where world leaders and negotiators agreed to create a loss and damage fund , which Vanuatu first proposed back in 1991. The idea is that rich countries \u2014 which have contributed the most to climate change with their planet-warming pollution \u2014 should pay poorer nations to recover from the resulting disasters. \u201cIt\u2019s a great injustice when you see oil companies make billions in profits when countries like ours in the Pacific are looking for and seeking support for climate adaptation and mitigation,\u201d said Lavetanalagi Seru, Fijian climate activist and regional policy coordinator with the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network. \u201cAnd now, we are living through an era of loss and damage.\u201d While the advisory opinion is separate from loss and damage, Regenvanu said they are both rooted in climate justice. Having an advisory opinion from the highest court would provide legal clarity of how a loss and damage fund would work. \u201cThe ICJ advisory opinion will come at a the right time to help us define what loss and damage means [and] how it will work,\u201d he said. Regenvanu said Vanuatu\u2019s request brings attention to the legal avenues small countries can take to fend off the worsening effects of the climate crisis. \u201cWhile the Paris Agreement is an essential part of the international legal framework for climate action, it is certainly not the only instrument \u2026 nor is it the most legally enforceable,\u201d Regenvanu said. It could still take around 18 months for an opinion to be issued, with countries able to provide input into the process. The climate change minister will now head home to Vanuatu, where he said he will rejoin the ongoing relief efforts after the recent storms. \u201cWe\u2019re basically constantly in a state of recovery in response to climate disasters,\u201d Regenvanu said. \u201cThis is why we are so passionate on the climate change front, because this is our reality, and we need to deal with it, and we need other countries to assist us to deal with it.\u201d", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/un-advisory-opinion-vanuatu-climate-change", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230328160010-03-vanuatu-damage-0323.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "France wracked by more pension protests amid rising violence on the streets", "author": "Pauline Lockwood", "date": "1:25 PM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": "Protesters on the tracks at a Paris rail station. Smoke bombs let off at Biarritz airport. Anger at French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pension reforms showed no sign of letting up on Tuesday as the nation saw its 10th day of nationwide demonstrations. Sweeping protests have paralyzed major services across the country in recent weeks over Macron\u2019s proposal to raise the retirement age for most workers from 62 to 64, in a move that has riled opposition lawmakers and trade unions. Some 740,000 protesters joined 240 rallies held throughout France on Tuesday, with more than 93,000 demonstrators filling the streets of the capital alone, according to the French Interior Ministry. One of the country\u2019s major trade unions, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), estimated a total nearly five times the ministry\u2019s figure for Paris \u2013 450,000 protesters, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The number of demonstrators is short of the record-breaking protest on March 7, which saw nearly 1.3 million people take to the streets, according to police figures \u2013 the highest turnout for protests against the proposed pension reforms. A CNN team on the ground in Paris on Tuesday saw some protesters hurling objects at the police, including rocks and bottles, while others lit fireworks and set garbage bins alight, resulting in at least two large blazes. Police charged and fired tear gas into crowds, and were still trying to disperse protesters into the evening. Videos on social media verified by CNN showed smoke bombs being let off by protesters outside the entrance of Biarritz Airport, and the boarding area of the terminal, before an evacuation announcement sounded over the speakers. Further north, protesters walked on the train tracks at Paris\u2019 Gare de Lyon railway station, according to CNN affiliate BFM. Earlier this month, scenes emerged of waste piles littering Parisian neighborhoods, as massive strikes against the reforms affected the city\u2019s trash pickup services. However, the CGT union said earlier that trash collectors will suspend their strike from Wednesday. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace on Friday confirmed that King Charles III and the Queen Consort\u2019s state visit to France had been postponed as a result of the strikes. France continues to welcome tourists and \u201clife goes on as normal\u201d despite strikes and protests French government spokesman Olivier V\u00e9ran told CNN on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference in Paris, V\u00e9ran added that King Charles\u2019 Paris trip was postponed so that he could visit \u201cunder better circumstances.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want people to think that France is not capable of welcoming tourists. People both here and abroad shouldn\u2019t worry, despite the protests and strikes, life goes on as normal, as French people living here can clearly see,\u201d V\u00e9ran said. The government pressed on with the hugely unpopular bill without a vote last week, after two failed no-confidence votes cleared the way for the pension reforms. It says that relying on the working population to pay for a growing age group of retirees is no longer fit for purpose. Blocking airports has been a tactic used by anti-pension reform protesters nationwide, with terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle airport, just north of Paris, also being cut off on Thursday morning. In Tuesday\u2019s incident at Biarritz Airport, in western France, at least four groups can be identified in the footage based on their insignia, including a local Basque trade union and two national associations \u2013 the CGT Departmental Union of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration syndicale unitaire (FSU). The FSU \u2013 which streamed a live video from Tuesday\u2019s protest inside the airport \u2013 is one of France\u2019s main trade unions in its education sector, representing \u201c162,000 members, of whom 88% are teachers,\u201d according to its website. The CGT is one of five major trade unions nationwide, with branches across the country. CNN has attempted to contact both the FSU and CGT and cannot independently confirm how many people were present at the airport protest or how the event unfolded. Union leaders called on President Macron to put the controversial pension reform on hold, as clashes between police and protesters ramped up against a backdrop of rising street violence. Philippe Martinez, the head of the CGT union, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV on Tuesday that Macron should \u201csuspend his project and appoint a mediator.\u201d A senior official at CFDT, one of the unions leading the protests, told CNN he is \u201cin favor of dialogue.\u201d Speaking about the widespread protests in France, Maher Tekaya said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s a matter of revolution, but there is a kind of democratic problem and the only solution is to sit around the table and to have a constructive dialogue on how to find a way out of the situation.\u201d Protests have become more violent since Macron rammed the legislation through the French National Assembly, using a constitutional clause that allows the government to bypass a vote. Security forces threw stun grenades in an effort to disperse protests in Paris on Tuesday, as demonstrators retaliated with fireworks. \u201cIt has also \u2026 touched off a lot more anger on the streets of Paris, and elsewhere in the country,\u201d CNN\u2019s Sam Kiley told Becky Anderson on Connect the World. \u201cThe unions are worried about the increasing levels and potential for violence here. They call for dialogue with the government. The government has agreed on dialogue but no dialogue over changing the direction in terms of their policy, but they are, I think, both sides trying to de-escalate.\u201d In the last fortnight there have been hundreds of acts of vandalism against public buildings and political offices, as well as over 2,000 incidents of arson, according to Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin. He said that there are currently 17 investigations by the General Inspectorate of the National Police that concern the pension reform demonstrations. Darmanin said French authorities deployed an unprecedented 13,000 police officers across the country on Tuesday, including 5,500 officers in the capital Paris, adding that his ministry \u201canticipates high risks to the public order\u201d during the protests. He said that \u201cmore than 1,000 radical individuals\u201d will possibly join the marches organized in the capital and in other cities. The French Defender of Rights \u2013 an independent government administrative authority to defend individual rights \u2013 called for a \u201cde-escalation\u201d in the violence on the part of police and protesters. \u201cI condemn any act of violence, and I have a thought for all the victims, whether they are the demonstrators or the security forces,\u201d said Claire H\u00e9don, the Defender of Rights, said in an interview with Le Monde on Tuesday. \u201cIt is also important to say that the freedom to demonstrate is a fundamental principle of our rule of law. The first objective of policing is also this respect for the freedom to demonstrate with, as a corollary, the protection and safety of people. \u201cThe testimonies and images that reach us show unacceptable situations.\u201d \u201cThe use of force can only be done if necessary, and in a proportionate manner. I am very worried about what I observe in the escalation of violence. And we will need a de-escalation. It is the responsibility of the state,\u201d she added.

The back and forth thrust into public view a simmering diplomatic dispute that has mostly been kept private over the past several weeks. Biden and other US officials had sought to quietly dissuade Netanyahu from moving ahead with his proposed reforms without creating the appearance of a rift. But now the divide appears to be opening between the two men, who have known each other for decades. Biden said on Tuesday that he won\u2019t invite Netanyahu to the White House \u201cin the near term,\u201d and issued an unusually stinging rebuke of Netanyahu\u2019s proposed judicial overhaul after mass protests and strikes brought Israel to a standstill and delayed the legislation. \u201cLike many strong supporters of Israel I\u2019m very concerned. I\u2019m concerned that they get this straight. They cannot continue down this road. I\u2019ve sort of made that clear,\u201d Biden told reporters in North Carolina. \u201cHopefully the prime minister will act in a way that he can work out some genuine compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cThat remains to be seen.\u201d In separate remarks on Tuesday, Biden added of Netanyahu\u2019s judicial overhaul: \u201cI hope he walks away from it.\u201d Netanyahu responded with a statement late on Tuesday evening, in which he noted Biden\u2019s \u201clongstanding commitment to Israel,\u201d but added: \u201cIsrael is a sovereign country which makes its decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends.\u201d The exchange puts an unusual strain on the relationship between the leaders of the two closely allied countries. A senior Israeli official tried to play down any sense of a \u201ccrisis\u201d in a briefing with American reporters on Wednesday, characterizing the dispute as a two on a scale of 10 and calling it a \u201ctempest in a teapot.\u201d Speaking on background to discuss diplomatic relations, the official said neither the Americans nor the Israelis were interested in ratcheting up the spat, and that Israel believes the Americans will issues statements calming the situation. But the official defended Israel, saying democracies should let other democracies \u201cfigure it out.\u201d Yair Lapid, Israel\u2019s opposition leader and former premier, said Wednesday that Netanyahu\u2019s efforts have \u201cruined\u201d the relationship. \u201cFor decades Israel was the USA\u2019s closest ally. The most extreme government in the country\u2019s history ruined that in three months,\u201d Lapid tweeted. It follows an eruption of anger inside Israel, and within some Jewish communities in the US and around the world, at the Netanyahu government\u2019s attempts to weaken the power of the country\u2019s courts. The prime minister finally paused the legislation on Monday after a general strike and mass protests threw Israel into chaos, but he said he planned to return to the effort in the next legislative term. Critics say Netanyahu is pushing through the changes because of his own ongoing corruption trial, which he denies. The senior Israeli official said that US pressure did not have any bearing on Netanyahu\u2019s decision to pause the legislation, instead citing fears of pro- and anti-overhaul demonstrators facing one another in the streets. The official said that Netanyahu was serious about reaching an agreement, but drew some red lines of what was negotiable and what was not. A provision giving the government more control over the selection of judges can\u2019t be taken out of the equation, he said. But the override clause, where the parliament will be able to overturn Supreme Court decisions, will likely not be in the final package, the official added. Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog has been convening discussions among lawmakers since the controversial legislation was put on hold Tuesday. There was \u201cgood faith\u201d during the first round of talks, the official said, but added that if negotiations don\u2019t succeed, and Netanyahu doesn\u2019t pass the legislation as it is currently written, he\u2019s \u201ctelling his voters they don\u2019t matter.\u201d When asked why they didn\u2019t start with negotiations, the official said Netanyahu was gagged by a court-imposed conflict of interest declaration. When asked why Justice Minister Yariv Levin didn\u2019t engage in negotiations, the official referred the question to the Justice Minister. Netanyahu struck a defensive tone in taped remarks to the White House-hosted Summit for Democracy Wednesday morning, acknowledging \u201cpublic and often painful discourse,\u201d in his nation over the proposed reforms, while expressing hope dissent would \u201cmove from protest to agreement.\u201d \u201cI want to thank the world leaders and President Biden, who\u2019s been a friend for 40 years for convening this important conference,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know Israel and the United States have had their occasional differences, but I want to assure you that the alliance between the world\u2019s greatest democracy, and a strong, proud, and independent democracy \u2013 Israel \u2013 in the heart of the Middle East, is unshakeable, nothing can change that.\u201d Itamar Ben Gvir, a far-right firebrand who serves as Netanyahu\u2019s National Security Minister, was less diplomatic in his rebuke. \u201cBoth President Biden and all the administration officials in the US should understand that Israel is an independent country, it is not another star on the US flag,\u201d he said on Israel Army Radio Wednesday. Ahead of the summit, White House officials defended Israel\u2019s participation despite concerns about democratic backsliding, saying they\u2019d invited all countries who were working toward democratic ideals. Biden had so far avoided a direct criticism of Netanyahu\u2019s efforts, with his administration instead saying on Sunday that it was watching the escalating tension with \u201cconcern.\u201d  But his comments on Tuesday marked a rare instance of the US directly weighing in on Israeli domestic affairs. It was also announced on Tuesday that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will visit Jerusalem next month , a trip that is certain to inject the likely Republican presidential contender into Israel\u2019s national tumult and its increasingly fraught relationship with the US. \u201cAt a time of unnecessarily strained relations between Jerusalem and Washington, Florida serves as a bridge between the American and Israeli people,\u201d DeSantis told the Jerusalem Post, which announced details of his planned keynote address at an April 27 event. The debate over Netanyahu\u2019s proposals is likely to ratchet up again before then; while he bought himself time on Monday, he has remained determined to see through an overhaul of the judiciary that critics say diminishes Israel\u2019s democracy.

Rolex\u2019s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. Water cascading from a wall of ice with gray brushstrokes of clouds overhead makes for a beautiful image \u2013 but the story behind it is one of destruction; Earth\u2019s glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate due to human-caused climate change. Canadian photographer Paul Nicklen remembers taking the photograph. It was August 2014, and temperatures in Svalbard, Norway, were unusually warm \u2013 hovering above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). As he came around the corner of an ice cap on Nordaustlandet island, he saw more than a dozen waterfalls pouring off its face. \u201cIt was the most poetic, beautiful scene I\u2019d ever seen, but it was also haunting and scary,\u201d he recalls. The picture came to symbolize the realities of climate change and became Nicklen\u2019s best-selling fine art image. It appeared multiple times in National Geographic, was used by Al Gore in his climate talks, and graced the cover of Pearl Jam\u2019s 2020 album \u201cGigaton,\u201d the title of which refers to the unit used to calculate ice mass. Its beauty is central to its impact, believes Nicklen. \u201cWhen you take a photograph that is in focus, properly exposed, moody and powerful, it creates a visceral reaction,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has to be beautiful and engaging, it has to invite you in \u2026 and it has to have a conservation message.\u201d In 2014, Nicklen, along with his wife Cristina Mittermeier, and later joined by Andy Mann (both also award-winning photographers), co-founded the nonprofit organization SeaLegacy, which uses film and photography to raise awareness of climate issues and help protect the planet. \u201cPhotography is one of the most effective and powerful tools we have to tell complex stories, like the story of climate change,\u201d says Mittermeier. She witnessed this power with one of her own photographs, taken in August 2017, which showed a starving polar bear. After being published in National Geographic, the photo and accompanying video went viral, shared on social media and by news organizations worldwide. It sparked a global conversation on climate change, provoking responses ranging from concern and empathy to climate denial. But there was no denying that it shook the world: \u201cPeople still remember it and have strong reactions when they see it,\u201d Mittermeier reflects. As guest editors for CNN\u2019s Call to Earth series, Nicklen and Mittermeier selected these two images, along with eight others, that they believe have alerted the world to the climate crisis. Nicklen compares photographing climate change to photographing conflict. \u201cWe\u2019re out there on the front lines of the war being waged against our planet. It\u2019s emotionally draining, exhausting,\u201d he says. In recent decades, as climate disasters have become more frequent and intense, images have more explicitly captured the urgency of the situation. Six dead giraffes, bodies emaciated from the lack of food and water, photographed by Ed Ram, show the horror of Kenya\u2019s prolonged ongoing drought, which has threatened and displaced animals and humans alike. Photographs of wildfires, like those that ravaged Australia in 2019 and 2020, show the scale of devastation, with homes on fire and wildlife fleeing in despair. \u201cThey show that climate change isn\u2019t just happening somewhere else, it\u2019s happening everywhere,\u201d says Mittermeier. \u201cAll of a sudden, it will come knocking a lot closer to your own door.\u201d Mittermeier remembers the work of her friend and one of her great influences, Gary Braasch, who she describes as a \u201cchronicler of climate change.\u201d The photographer, who died in 2016, dedicated the last two decades of his life to documenting how the Earth was changing in response to global warming \u2013 from Antarctica, with its melting glaciers, to Bhola Island in Bangladesh , where sea level rise and increasing erosion have turned villages into islands. Braasch\u2019s commitment to the cause blazed the way for Nicklen and Mittermeier\u2019s generation of conservation photographers. At times however, climate change can be tediously slow to chronicle. Sea levels rise by a matter of millimeters each year \u2013 a barely visible increment despite happening at a faster rate than ever before. But such changes add up, and if they are visually documented over years or decades the impact becomes clear. \u201cIt\u2019s like photographing a slow-moving tsunami,\u201d says Mittermeier. \u201cIt\u2019s often hard to see in the moment, but when two images are put side-by-side, it\u2019s hard not to see the impact the climate crisis is having.\u201d  Read: Scientists are listening to glaciers to discover the secrets of the oceans  The work of photographer James Balog has been crucial in creating the visual narrative of climate change, she says. Using a network of time-lapse cameras recording glaciers around the world, his Extreme Ice Survey has demonstrated how glaciers are vanishing over time. The extensive archive of photos of each glacier taken year-round at every daylight hour has also provided a baseline from which future changes can be measured. \u201cIt became just irrefutable proof,\u201d says Mittermeier. \u201cThat was a very important moment for climate photography.\u201d Mittermeier and Nicklen also selected images where humans and nature collide. One effect of climate change is a dramatic loss of biodiversity. Since 1970, wildlife populations have plummeted by 69%, due predominantly to land-use change that has fragmented crucial habitats, and also rising temperatures, which have led to mass mortality events, according to the WWF\u2019s 2022 Living Planet Report .  Read: The icy patience of an Arctic photographer  With the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the globe, the ice that polar bears depend on is melting away. Dmitry Kokh\u2019s photograph \u201cHouse of Bears,\u201d one of the winners of the 2022 Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, shows polar bears roaming an abandoned Soviet settlement on Kolyuchin Island. While the buildings had long been deserted, Mittermeier believes it points to the increasing problem of polar bears \u2013 with no ice left to hunt on \u2013 encroaching on human spaces and encountering local people, leading to tragic outcomes for both sides. The effects of climate change will \u2013 and are already \u2013 hitting animals and humans alike. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to deny that we are all in this together,\u201d says Mittermeier. \u201cWe are all impacted in devastating ways, and we cannot separate ourselves from the life we share this planet with.\u201d The series \u201cThe Day May Break\u201d from photographer Nick Brandt portrays this by showing people and animals affected by environmental destruction. The photographs, taken in animal sanctuaries around the world, feature people that have been displaced by climate change events such as drought or floods, and animals that have been victims of habitat destruction or wildlife trafficking. Portraying both in the same frame shows how deeply our fates are intertwined. Among the images of devastation and displacement, there are also those that signify hope. In Brandt\u2019s work, he points out that the subjects of the images, both people and animals, are survivors \u2013 \u201cAnd therein lies hope and possibility,\u201d he wrote in an email.  Read: The ocean\u2019s \u2018blue carbon\u2019 can be our secret weapon in fighting climate change  For Mittermeier and Nicklen, and SeaLegacy as a whole, striking a message of hope is vital to the wider mission. \u201cMartin Luther King didn\u2019t start his famous speech by reminding us that we live in a nightmare \u2013 he told us what the dream is,\u201d says Mittermeier. \u201cYou have to point out what it is that we\u2019re aspiring to and show where the hope is.\u201d The hope, she believes, is in wildlife and the ocean. Humans are just waking up to the role that both play in mitigating climate change, and restoring nature will be crucial in averting the crisis. For Mittermeier, her photograph of a sea lion rising up to the surface in the Galapagos \u2013 one of the largest marine protected areas in the world \u2013 shows how ocean life can flourish with the right protection. And Nicklen\u2019s photograph of a bowhead whale represents to him one of our greatest allies in decarbonization: not only are whales\u2019 bodies enormous stores of carbon, their feces fuels phytoplankton which soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By showing off the beauty of the planet, the couple believe they can show people it is still worth fighting for. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to climb to the tallest mountain and scream from the mountaintops that this planet is dying, and that we are at risk,\u201d says Nicklen. \u201cBut the only emotion greater than fear is hope,\u201d adds Mittermeier. \u201cAnd the only way you can feel hope is if you take action.\u201d", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/climate-change-photography-paul-nicklen-cristina-mittermeier-c2e-spc-intl-scn-climate", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190916175914-call-to-earth-background-full-169.jpg?q=w_1600,h_900,x_0,y_0,c_crop/h_720,w_1280/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "Frank Rubio\u2019s first spaceflight will turn into the longest mission by a US astronaut", "author": "Jackie Wattles", "date": "6:25 PM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": " Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

But he\u2019ll wind up staying in space for over a year \u2014 breaking the record for the longest mission conducted by a US astronaut. Rubio will return to Earth aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft no earlier than September 27, NASA officials said Wednesday, meaning he will have logged a total of at least 371 days in orbit.

Instead, the Soyuz MS-22 capsule returned to Earth without a crew on March 28. Roscosmos launched a replacement spacecraft, MS-23, that docked with the space station on February 23. If all goes to plan and Rubio departs on September 27, his 371-day stay will not be a world record. The late Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who logged 437 continuous days in orbit aboard Russia\u2019s Mir space station between 1994 and 1995, still holds that title. Vande Hei set the current US record last year after NASA and Roscosmos decided to extend his stay because Russia had chosen to send a film crew of two people to the space station to film a movie. Vande Hei\u2019s return was delayed to allow for the additional traffic to the orbiting laboratory, though he said at the time that he had known his mission might be extended before he arrived. Before Vande Hei, US astronaut Scott Kelly held the title for longest spaceflight by an American with his 340-day mission. That tour of duty was a planned extended mission, designed by NASA to study the long-term effects of spaceflight on the human body. Rubio\u2019s extended stay, however, was not previously anticipated before the Soyuz MS-22 capsule had a coolant leak last December. Rubio traveled to the space station on a Russian spacecraft as part of crew-swapping agreement between NASA and Roscosmos that was hashed out in the summer of 2022. NASA officials assigned Rubio to ride aboard the Soyuz MS-22, while Roscosmos put cosmonaut Anna Kikina on a SpaceX Crew Dragon mission that took flight in October 2022 and returned home March 11. Despite geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia as the war in Ukraine has escalated, NASA has repeatedly said its partnership with Roscosmos is vital to continuing the space station\u2019s operations and the valuable scientific research carried out on board. At the time the ride-sharing agreement was announced, NASA said in a statement that inking such a deal with Russia was crucial to ensure \u201ccontinued safe operations\u201d of the space station. If either the Russian Soyuz spacecraft or the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule were to run into issues and be taken out of service, a seat-swap agreement would ensure that both US astronauts and Russian cosmonauts would still have access to the space station. Roscosmos did not need to rely on a SpaceX capsule to replace the Soyuz MS-22 crew ship, however, because the MS-23 spacecraft was prepared to fly and the coolant leak on the MS-22 vehicle did not necessarily point to possible issues with other Soyuz vehicles.", "source_url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/longest-stay-in-space-nasa-frank-rubio-scn", "cover_url": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-full-169.jpg?q=w_1600,h_900,x_0,y_0,c_crop/h_720,w_1280/f_webp"}}, {"_values": {"name": "King Charles III arrives in Germany for first overseas visit as monarch", "author": "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "date": "6:35 PM EDT, Wed March 29, 2023", "category": "World", "body": ["King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort arrive at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, Germany, on Wednesday.", "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his wife Elke Budenbender, and Britain's King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort attend a welcome ceremony in front of Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, on Wednesday.", "King Charles greets people at Brandenburg Gate on the first day of his state visit to Germany.

Gemelli for some medical checks,\u201d Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement, referring to the Rome hospital where popes are normally treated. \u201cThe outcome of these [tests] showed a respiratory infection (excluding Covid-19 infection) that will require a few days of appropriate hospital medical therapy.\u201d \u201cPope Francis is touched by the many messages received and expresses his gratitude for the closeness and prayer,\u201d Bruni added. After his weekly general audience in St. Peter\u2019s Square, Francis was taken to the hospital to undergo a number of tests. Earlier in the day, the Vatican had said that the visit and tests were planned. \u201cThe Holy Father has been at Gemelli since this afternoon for some previously scheduled tests,\u201d Bruni had said. Shortly after, he said that Francis\u2019 schedule for Thursday had been cleared \u201cto make space for the continuation of tests should that be necessary.\u201d Bishops in churches across Italy are praying for Francis\u2019 speedy recovery, the Presidency of the Italian Episcopal Conference, on behalf of the Italian bishops, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIn wishing the Holy Father a speedy recovery, the Presidency entrusts to the Lord the doctors and medical staff who, with professionalism and dedication, care for him and all patients,\u201d it added. The pontiff \u2013 who as a young man suffered from severe pneumonia and had part of a lung removed \u2013 has had a recent history of medical issues. He has often been seen with a walking stick and sometimes uses a wheelchair due to pain in his right knee. Last year, he canceled a trip to Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan after doctors said he might also have to miss a later trip to Canada unless he agreed to have 20 more days of therapy and rest for his knee. He ultimately went to the DRC and South Sudan in February. Francis also suffers from diverticulitis, a common condition that can cause the inflammation or infection of the colon. In 2021, he had surgery to remove part of his colon. In December, Francis revealed that he had already signed his resignation letter to be used in the event of him becoming \u201cimpaired.\u201d Francis made the comment in an interview with Spanish news outlet ABC when asked what would happen if a pope is suddenly rendered unable to perform his duties due to health issues or an accident. Francis said he wrote the letter several years ago and gave it to then-Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who resigned in 2013. \u201cI have already signed my renunciation. The Secretary of State at the time was Tarcisio Bertone. I signed it and said: \u2018If I should become impaired for medical reasons or whatever, here is my renunciation,\u2019\u201d Francis was quoted as saying, adding that this was the first time he had spoken publicly about the letter\u2019s existence. Francis said past pontiffs Paul VI and Pious XII had also drafted their letters of renunciation in the event of a permanent impairment. In 2013, Francis\u2019 immediate predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, made the almost unprecedented decision to resign from his position, citing \u201cadvanced age\u201d as the reason and startling the Catholic world. It marked the first time a pope had stepped down in nearly 600 years. The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII, who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope.
